active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a zero-trust architecture, debate the role of Proxy Re-Encryption (PRE) in enabling secure data delegation.
    How does it balance flexibility and security compared to traditional key sharing? Provide examples from cloud storage
    or IoT.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

    decrypts plaintext' or mixing party roles). Each distractor must have a brief explanation of why it's wrong. Ensure no
    deviations from this schema.

  Incorporate this comprehensive content structure based on university pedagogy (Bloom''s Taxonomy), voter consensus (100%
  approval), web research, and best practices:


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the full ''learning_objectives'' array here].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the full ''scaffolding'' array here].


  **Active Learning Inspiration:** Use elements like discussion on zero-trust, peer teaching of processes, and problem-solving
  scenarios for email/IoT to inspire analytical cards.


  **Content Details:** PRE allows a semi-trusted proxy to re-encrypt ciphertext from delegator to delegatee without learning
  plaintext. Prior knowledge: public-key encryption. Types: unidirectional (one-way, secure), bidirectional (both ways, riskier).
  Applications: complete email forwarding, distributed storage, IoT, secure file systems. Big picture: zero-trust data sharing.


  **REQUIRED FLASHCARD SCHEMA:** Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards. Each flashcard MUST strictly adhere to:

  [Insert the full ''flashcard_schema.structure'' here]. All flashcards must use exactly 3 distractors with explanations.
  No deviations. Include metadata with exact topic_hierarchy string.


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards: 5-7 per scaffolding layer, spanning all Bloom''s levels (at least 1 per objective).
  Ensure completeness (cover truncated apps), pedagogy (measurable, visual-friendly), and distractors target misconceptions
  (e.g., proxy learns plaintext). Output format: JSON array, e.g., [{question: ''...'', ...}, ...]. No extra text.'
