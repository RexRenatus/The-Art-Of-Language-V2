        "core_logic": "The key distinction lies in their infrastructure requirements. Ring signatures are designed to be 'ad-hoc,' meaning users can form a signing group dynamically without needing a central authority to manage membership or issue credentials. Group signatures, while also providing anonymity, typically require a group manager to handle joining, leaving, and revocation of members, which adds a layer of centralized trust. [link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00145-007-9011-9)",
        "distractor_analysis": "PKI is not a defining difference; both can be PKI-agnostic. Both are signature schemes, not for encryption. Anonymity is a core goal for both, and ring signatures are specifically designed for strong anonymity within their context.",
        "analogy": "Ring signatures are like a group of friends deciding to sign a card together spontaneously – no organizer needed. Group signatures are like a club where you have to officially join, and a club secretary manages who's in and who's out."
