  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the implications of NIST''s selection of the Ascon family for lightweight cryptography standardization:
    Did they prioritize speed, security margins, simplicity, or a balance? Support your position with performance metrics
    and IoT use cases, considering the projected 75B+ IoT devices by 2025.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    secure than AES''); 2) Partial truths (e.g., mix Ascon variants); 3) Confusions (e.g., AEAD vs. plain encryption); 4)
    Real-world non-examples (e.g., AES metrics). Ensure one distractor is a frequent error from IoT contexts.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST Lightweight Cryptography
  Standardization (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cryptographic Solutions > Emerging
  and Advanced Cryptographic Technologies > Lightweight Cryptography > NIST Lightweight Cryptography Standardization).


  Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema provided. Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full list above].

  - Active Learning: [reference activities for links].

  - Scaffolding: Prior knowledge + 4 layers [paste summaries].

  - Research Context: NIST LWC for IoT (Ascon family: AEAD like Ascon-128, hash/XOF; efficiency for constrained devices; sources:
  NIST.gov/lwc).

  - Voter Priorities: Completeness (full Ascon details), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression, misconceptions), formative assessments
  (MCQs with distractors).


  Output as JSON array of objects, each matching the flashcard_schema exactly. Ensure variety, pedagogical depth, and no repetition.
  Front questions must be engaging and active (e.g., ''Why is AES unsuitable for...?''). Explanations include feedback/remediation.
  Distractors follow protocol strictly.'
