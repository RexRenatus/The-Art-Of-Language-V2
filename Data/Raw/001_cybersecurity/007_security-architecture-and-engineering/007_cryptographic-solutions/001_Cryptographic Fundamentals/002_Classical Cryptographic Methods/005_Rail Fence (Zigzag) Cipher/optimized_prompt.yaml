active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student creates a short plaintext message and specifies a rail key; the partner encrypts it
    using the Rail Fence Cipher. Switch roles for decryption. Discuss any errors and misconceptions (e.g., confusing transposition
    with substitution).
  problem_solving: 'Given a ciphertext ''WECRUOERDSOEERNTNEAIVDAC'' and unknown rail key (hint: 3 rails), use trial-and-error
    with 2-5 rails to decrypt and recover ''WE ARE DISCOVERED. RUN AT ONCE.''. Extend to real-world: How would spies break
    enemy messages without the key?'

    1. Common misconception (e.g., treat as substitution).

    Explain each distractor''s flaw explicitly.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² CISSP domains. Generate
  50 high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized flashcards for the topic ''Rail Fence (Zigzag) Cipher'' using the EXACT topic
  hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cryptographic Solutions > Cryptographic Fundamentals
  > Classical Cryptographic Methods > Rail Fence (Zigzag) Cipher.


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Active learning: [insert summaries]

  - Scaffolding: Strictly generate cards from 4 layers [insert summaries].

  - Big picture: Historical transposition cipher; educational bridge to modern crypto (e.g., AES); insecure (frequency analysis).

  - Research: Use encryption example ''WE ARE DISCOVERED. RUN AT ONCE.'' (3 rails) → ''WECRUOERDSOEERNTNEAIVDAC''. Include
  full decryption: Rail lengths (11/15/10), fill rows, read zigzag.

  - Concept map: Tie cards to central nodes.


  Follow flashcard schema EXACTLY: Multiple-choice (1 correct + 3 distractors w/ explanations), JSON array output with metadata
  (front, back, objective, layer 1-4, hierarchy path). Balance Bloom''s levels. Distractors: misconception, calculation error,
  alternative method. Explanations: 2-4 sentences, pedagogical, link to layers/objectives. Ensure university pedagogy: active
  recall, no hints in questions.'
