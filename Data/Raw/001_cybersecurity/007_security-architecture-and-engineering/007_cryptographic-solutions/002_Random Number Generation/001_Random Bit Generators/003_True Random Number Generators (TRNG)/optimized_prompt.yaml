active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare TRNGs and PRNGs (DRBGs) in terms of security for key generation. Debate scenarios where TRNG
    failure (e.g., predictable entropy due to faulty noise source) leads to real-world breaches (e.g., predictable nonces
    in TLS), referencing NIST SP 800-90B health tests and trade-offs in speed vs. unpredictability.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    for PRNG confusion); 2) Related but incorrect concept (e.g., ''Quantum computing'' instead of ''quantum phenomena'');
    3) Extreme/edge case (e.g., ''Infinite entropy'' vs. ''min-entropy''). Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter
    suggestions and NIST pitfalls.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in True Random Number Generators\
  \ (TRNG) within the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cryptographic Solutions > Random\
