  discussion_prompt: 'Analyze the Debian OpenSSL RNG bug: Why did removing a single line of code make SSH and SSL keys predictable?
    How does this highlight the differences between CSPRNG and standard PRNG, and what lessons apply to entropy management
    today?'
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains CSPRNG seeding and entropy using an analogy (e.g., a lottery machine with
    biased balls if entropy is poor), while the other teaches back state protection and reseeding. Switch roles and discuss
    applications.
  problem_solving: 'Given pseudocode for a weak linear congruential PRNG, modify it step-by-step to comply with NIST SP 800-90A
    (e.g., add entropy source, conditioning, DRBG core). Test in a simulated attack: generate TLS nonces and check predictability
    using statistical tests.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 25-35 high-quality flashcards
  on ''Cryptographically Secure PRNG (CSPRNG)'' using university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (cover all levels per objectives),
  active learning inspiration (e.g., Debian bug analysis), 4-layer scaffolding, and research context below.


  **Research Context (Completed):** CSPRNGs provide unpredictable randomness for crypto ops, unlike PRNGs vulnerable to state
  prediction. Core: Entropy (measure of unpredictability, from NIST SP 800-90B: physical/system sources like timing jitter,
  validated via tests), Seed (initial entropy), State (protected internal). Standards: NIST SP 800-90A (DRBGs: Hash/HMAC/CTR_DRBG),
  800-90B (Entropy Sources, https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-90B), 800-90C (RBG Constructions). Pitfalls: Debian OpenSSL
  (removed PID entropy), Dual_EC_DRBG (NSA backdoor). Apps: TLS nonces/keys, salting. Sources: NIST pubs, OpenSSL docs.


  **Prior Knowledge:** Links to basic PRNGs (deterministic, e.g., LCG), true RNGs (hardware), entropy basics.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert array from above].

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert array from above] – Distribute cards: 30% L1, 25% L2, 25% L3, 20% L4.

  **Active Learning Inspiration:** Use for cards (e.g., analysis questions on bugs, apply via pseudocode mods).


  Generate diverse cards: 40% MCQs (with 3 distractors), 30% Q&A definitions/explanations, 20% scenario analysis, 10% design
  prompts. Ensure measurable, active recall.


  **Output Requirements:** ONLY valid JSON array of card objects conforming EXACTLY to the schema below. No intro/text. Schema:
  [Insert full flashcard_schema.card_structure here].

  **Distractor Protocol:** [Insert from flashcard_schema.distrator_protocol].

  **Quality:** Cards promote spaced repetition, link to real-world (TLS), correct misconceptions.'
