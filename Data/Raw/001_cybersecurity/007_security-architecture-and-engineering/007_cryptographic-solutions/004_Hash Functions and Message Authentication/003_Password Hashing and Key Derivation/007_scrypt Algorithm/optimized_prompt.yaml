active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios would you prefer scrypt over other PBKDFs like PBKDF2 or Argon2, considering trade-offs
    in memory usage, computation time, and security against GPU/ASIC attacks? Provide real-world examples from industry implementations
    (e.g., Litecoin wallet encryption) and debate optimal parameter choices (N, r, p), addressing misconceptions like 'stronger
    parameters are always better'.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Hashing and Key Derivation > scrypt Algorithm). Use provided research context, complete with RFC 7914 details.


  Prior Knowledge: PBKDF2, bcrypt, salts, brute-force/GPU/ASIC attacks.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full list above]

  - Active Learning: [reference discussion/peer/problem-solving for higher-level cards]

  - Scaffolding: Generate cards progressively across 4 layers [paste full layers].

  - Prioritize voter consensus: memory-hardness, params N/r/p, ROMix/BlockMix/Salsa20/8, comparisons (Argon2), real-world
  params.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards matching exact schema: [paste full schema structure]. Ensure even distribution: 1/3
  lower Bloom''s (REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND), 1/3 middle (APPLY/ANALYZE), 1/3 higher (EVALUATE/CREATE). Varied difficulties, no
  duplicates. High-quality, exam-ready.'
