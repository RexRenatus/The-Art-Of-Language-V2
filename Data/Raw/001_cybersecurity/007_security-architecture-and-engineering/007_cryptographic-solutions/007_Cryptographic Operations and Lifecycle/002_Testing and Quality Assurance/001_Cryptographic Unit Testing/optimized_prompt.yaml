active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent can unit testing ensure cryptographic implementations are secure against real-world attacks?
    Debate the limitations of test vectors versus comprehensive testing strategies like fuzzing or formal methods, using examples
    from NIST CAVP/ACVP or historical failures like Padding Oracle.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Base on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse CAVP with CMVP, FIPS levels, test vector types like KAT vs. MCT)
    - 'Plausible errors: Wrong algorithm params (AES-128 vs 256), outdated standards (FIPS 140-2 vs 140-3), over/under-state
      limitations (unit tests prevent all attacks)'
    - 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1 semantically close, 1 factual inversion, 1 unrelated but crypto-sounding'
    - Avoid obvious wrongs; ensure distractors teach by elimination
