active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare STRIDE and PASTA threat modeling frameworks for cryptographic systems. Debate their strengths
    in addressing side-channel attacks vs. key management threats, and vote on the best for a blockchain application.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truth/mix-up (e.g., confuse STRIDE categories), 3) Unrelated or extreme (e.g., non-crypto threat or overgeneralization).
    Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter-noted misconceptions and research.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert educational flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity pedagogy. Create 50 high-quality,
  optimized flashcards for the topic ''Threat Modeling for Cryptographic Systems'' (Category: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture
  And Engineering > Cryptographic Solutions > Cryptographic Operations and Lifecycle > Testing and Quality Assurance > Threat
  Modeling for Cryptographic Systems). Use university-style pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives, active learning, 4-layer
  scaffolding, and web-grounded context.


  **Topic Context (Research Summary):** Threat modeling systematically identifies threats/vulnerabilities in cryptographic
  systems (ensuring confidentiality, integrity, etc.). Core: Assets (keys/data), Threats (brute-force, side-channels), Vulnerabilities
  (impl flaws). Big picture: Prevents failures like Heartbleed; role in crypto lifecycle (design/implement/test); emerging
  quantum threats. Frameworks: STRIDE, PASTA, NIST SP 800-37 RMF, SP 800-57, DREAD, OCTAVE. Concept map: ''Threat Modeling''
  → Assets/Threats/Vulns/Risks → Crypto-specific (side-channels, key compromise).


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s):** [Insert the 6 objectives from above JSON].


  **Active Learning (Reference in cards):** [Insert discussion_prompt, peer_teaching_activity, problem_solving_exercise from
  above JSON].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers from above JSON]. Prior knowledge: Basic crypto (symmetric/asymmetric, hashing),
  STRIDE intro.


  **Flashcard Generation Rules:**

  - Output as JSON array: [{''id'':1, ''front'':''...'', ''back'':{...}}, ...]

  - Follow exact schema: [Insert full flashcard_schema from above JSON].

  - Ensure voter consensus (100%): Pedagogy focus, complete standards, big picture.

  - Cards promote active learning: e.g., ''How would you apply this in peer teaching?''

  - Varied Q types: Definitions (Layer1), Comparisons (Layer2), Scenarios (Layer3), Critiques/Designs (Layer4).

  - High-quality: Plausible distractors, evidence-based explanations, spaced repetition friendly.'
