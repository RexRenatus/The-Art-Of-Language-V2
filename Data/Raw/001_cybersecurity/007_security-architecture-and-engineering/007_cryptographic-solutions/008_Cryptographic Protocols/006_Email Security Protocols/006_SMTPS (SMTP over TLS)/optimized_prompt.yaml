active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the security implications of Implicit TLS (port 465) versus STARTTLS (port 587). Considering RFC
    8314, argue which should be the standard for email submission and why, addressing potential vulnerabilities like downgrade
    attacks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
  additional_activities:
  - Think-pair-share on misconceptions (e.g., 'SMTP is secure by default').
  - 'Role-playing: Simulate attacker eavesdropping on cleartext SMTP vs. defender implementing SMTPS.'
  - 'Hands-on: Use openssl s_client to test STARTTLS on real servers (e.g., gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com:587).'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Cryptographic Protocols
  under Security Architecture and Engineering (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cryptographic
  Solutions > Cryptographic Protocols > Email Security Protocols > SMTPS (SMTP over TLS)). Generate high-quality flashcards
  optimized for spaced repetition and Bloom''s Taxonomy.


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: Use to inspire applied cards (e.g., scenario-based Qs from discussion/problem-solving).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers: [insert scaffolding array here].

  - Big Picture: Cards must contextualize SMTPS role in preventing eavesdropping/MITM, per RFC 8314/3207.

  - Research Context: SMTP unencrypted (port 25), Implicit TLS (465, secure start), STARTTLS (587/25, RFC 3207 upgrade), TLS
  1.2+, no cleartext.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: [insert flashcard_schema here]. Output 25 flashcards in JSON array: [{''type'': ''MCQ|Q&A|cloze'',
  ''layer'': 1-4, ''blooms'': ''REMEMBER|etc'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...''}]. Ensure
  active recall, no hints in front, pedagogical distractors, and progression from remember to create.'
