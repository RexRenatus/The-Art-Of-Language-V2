active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using supersingular versus complex multiplication (CM)
    curves for pairing-based cryptography in IoT devices. Consider embedding degree efficiency, security against known attacks,
    and computational overhead. Support arguments with examples from real-world standards like NIST evaluations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    vs. bilinear); 2) Similar concepts (e.g., ECC scalar mult vs. pairing); 3) Edge cases (e.g., high embedding degree as
    ''secure'' when it''s inefficient); 4) Partial truths (e.g., ''Supersingular curves are always quantum-resistant'' – actually
    vulnerable to SIDH attacks). Ensure distractors are plausible for intermediate learners.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for university-level cybersecurity education on ''Pairing-Based Cryptography''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cryptographic Solutions > Asymmetric Cryptography

  on pedagogy, scaffolding, etc.), and this optimized learning structure to generate high-quality Anki-style flashcards.


  **Research Context Summary:** Pairings are bilinear maps e: G1 x G2 → GT on elliptic curves with small embedding degree
  k. Key apps: IBE (Setup, KeyGen, Encrypt, Decrypt per Boneh-Franklin). Curves: Supersingular/CM. Importance: Certificate-less
  for IoT/5G, NIST standards. Sources: Boneh-Franklin ''Identity-Based Encryption from the Weil Pairing'' (2001); BLS Short
  Signatures (2001); NIST SP 800-56A Rev. 3 (pairing-based key establishment); Brent-Washington supersingular curves.
