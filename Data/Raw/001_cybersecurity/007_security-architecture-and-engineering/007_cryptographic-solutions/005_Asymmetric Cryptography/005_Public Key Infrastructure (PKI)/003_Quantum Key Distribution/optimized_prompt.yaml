  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''QKD provides unconditional information-theoretic security,
    making classical PKI obsolete in a post-quantum world.'' Support your position with references to the No-Cloning Theorem,
    QBER detection, and real-world deployments (e.g., China''s Micius satellite), while addressing counterarguments like practical
    limitations.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., ''QKD uses quantum computers for encryption'').'
    - 'Distractor 2: Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''QBER detects all errors, not just Eve'').'
    - 'Distractor 3: Classical analogy confusion (e.g., ''Like RSA key exchange, based on factoring'').'
    - Ensure distractors are 70-80% plausible to high school/early undergrad level; avoid obvious errors.
