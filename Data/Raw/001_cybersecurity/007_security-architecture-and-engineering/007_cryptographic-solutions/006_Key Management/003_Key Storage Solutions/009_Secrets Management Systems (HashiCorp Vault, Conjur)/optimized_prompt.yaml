active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a debate format, argue whether dynamic secrets in HashiCorp Vault provide superior security over static
    secrets in traditional systems like config files. Use real-world breach examples (e.g., Codecov incident where static
    credentials were compromised) to support your position, and counterarguments from Conjur's machine identity approach.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    secrets never expire''), mix Vault/Conjur features (e.g., attribute Vault''s leasing to Conjur), outdated info (e.g.,
    ignore TTL renewal), real-world breaches (e.g., imply static safer post-Codecov). Ensure plausibility (50% stem-match),
    avoid ''all/none'' options.'
