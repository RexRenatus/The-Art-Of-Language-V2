active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a debate format, argue whether TPM 2.0's improvements over 1.2 (e.g., enhanced algorithms, enhanced
    authorization policies, and fTPM support) justify widespread adoption despite compatibility issues and deployment challenges
    like hardware vs. firmware implementations. Consider real-world factors such as cost, zero-trust models, and examples
    from BitLocker or Secure Boot failures.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    SRK (key storage); 2) Mix binding (TPM-only) with sealing (TPM+state); 3) Oversimplify PCRs as ''just hashes'' vs. measured
    chain; 4) TPM 1.2/2.0 feature swaps; 5) Ignore fTPM/discrete differences. Ensure plausible (e.g., partial truths), avoid
    randomness—tie to research context.'

  (TPM) under the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cryptographic Solutions > Key Management

  Generate a deck of 25 high-quality MCQ flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet, using the exact schema: Front (question),
  Back (correct answer, 3 distractors A-D, explanation 50-100 words, Bloom level, source).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full array from above]

  - Active Learning: Inspire critical thinking—explanations reference discussion (e.g., TPM 2.0 trade-offs), peer teaching
  (e.g., binding/sealing examples), problem-solving (e.g., VPN key scenarios).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards: Layer 1 Foundation (cards 1-6), Layer 2 Components (7-12), Layer 3 Implementation (13-18),
  Layer 4 Integration (19-25). Build progressively.

  - Prior Knowledge: Assume basics in crypto/hardware; explain connections.

  - Big Picture: Emphasize TPM as Root of Trust for BitLocker, Secure Boot, zero-trust.

  - Research Context: Use definitions (secure cryptoprocessor, EK/SRK/PCRs, binding/sealing, integrity measurement); standards
  TCG/ISO/NIST SP 800-155/193.


  Flashcard Rules:

  - Balance Bloom''s: 30% Remember/Understand, 40% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate/Create.

  - Distractors: Plausible misconceptions (EK/SRK confusion, binding/sealing mix-up, PCR oversimplification, 1.2/2.0 swaps).

  - Explanations: Tie to objectives/layers, correct misconceptions, add real-world (e.g., laptop theft, supply chain), suggest
  active learning tie-in.

  - Output Format: JSON array of objects, each {"front": "...", "back": {"correct_answer": "...", "distractors": {"A": "...",
  ...}, "explanation": "...", "bloom_level": "...", "source": "..."}}.


  Ensure university-level rigor, active recall, no hints in questions. Voter consensus: 100% approval on pedagogy.'
