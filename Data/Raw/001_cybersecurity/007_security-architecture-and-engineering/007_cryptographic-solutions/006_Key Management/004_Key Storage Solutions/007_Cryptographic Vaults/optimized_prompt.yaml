active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios would you prefer on-premises HSMs over cloud-based vaults like AWS KMS, considering
    factors such as cost, scalability, compliance (e.g., FIPS 140-3), latency, and regulatory requirements like HIPAA or PCI-DSS?
    Justify your choice with pros/cons.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    vs. never-export), 2) Related but incorrect term (e.g., ''software wallet'' vs. HSM), 3) Partial truth (e.g., ''cloud-only''
    vs. hybrid). Ensure distractors teach by contrast.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education on ''Cryptographic Vaults'' (hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Security Architecture & Engineering > Cryptographic Solutions > Key Management > Key Storage Solutions >
  Cryptographic Vaults). Use the provided learning objectives (spanning Bloom''s: Remember to Create), active learning elements
  (discussion/peer/problem-solving), and 4-layer scaffolding (Foundation: definitions/prereqs/concept map; Components: HSM/CKMS/NIST;
  Implementation: lifecycle steps/examples; Integration: standards/cloud). Incorporate full content: HSMs (tamper-resistant,
  FIPS 140-3), CKMS (key lifecycle: gen/store/dist/use/backup/revoke), NIST SP 800-57 (key mgmt, types/protections: symmetric/asym/key-wrapping,
  all states), SP 800-130 (CKMS framework), sources (csrc.nist.gov/publications). Prerequisites: basic crypto keys.
