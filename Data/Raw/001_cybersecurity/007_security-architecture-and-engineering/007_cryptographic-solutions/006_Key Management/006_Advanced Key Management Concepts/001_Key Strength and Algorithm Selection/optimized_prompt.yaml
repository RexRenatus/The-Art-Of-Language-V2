active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In light of emerging quantum threats, debate whether organizations should prioritize key strength (e.g.,
    AES-256) or algorithm agility (e.g., NIST-approved post-quantum options like Kyber or Dilithium). Use NIST SP 800-57 for
    security strength mappings and SP 800-131A for transition timelines to support arguments on trade-offs in cost, performance,
    and risk.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Full Research Context:** Core Concepts: Cryptographic key (sym/ asym), algorithm, key strength (bits: 80-256), cryptoperiod.
  NIST SP 800-57 (Pt1 General: security strength mappings e.g., AES-128=128bits, RSA3072=128bits; cryptoperiods e.g., sym1-2yrs).
  SP 800-131A Rev2: Transitions – Post-2030 acceptable: AES≥128 (3DES legacy end2023), RSA≥2048 (1024 end2013), EC≥224bits,
  SHA-2/3 only. Quantum: NIST PQC (Kyber etc.). Sources: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r5.pdf
