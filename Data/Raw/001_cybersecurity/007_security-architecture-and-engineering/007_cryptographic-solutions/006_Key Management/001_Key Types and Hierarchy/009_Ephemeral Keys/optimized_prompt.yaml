active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the scenarios where static keys might still be preferable over ephemeral
    keys (e.g., resource-constrained IoT devices), and propose mitigations using ephemeral keys where possible. Support arguments
    with references to Zero Trust principles.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Topic: Ephemeral Keys (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity\
  \ > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cryptographic Solutions > Key Management > Key Types and Hierarchy > Ephemeral\
  \ Keys). Use this exact content for accuracy:\n\n[Insert full synthesized content here: Core Concepts from research + completed\
  \ standards (NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 Rev. 5: key types/lifecycle/ephemeral emphasis; RFC 8446 TLS 1.3; FIPS 140-3; ISO/IEC\
  \ 19790) + scaffolding layers above + objectives + active learning scenarios].\n\nIncorporate university pedagogy: Bloom's\
  \ Taxonomy (balance levels), active recall via MCQs, scaffolding progression.\n\nGenerate exactly 25-30 flashcards covering\
  \ all layers (6-8 each), objectives, and hierarchy. Ensure variety: 40% remember/understand, 30% apply/analyze, 30% evaluate/create.\n\
