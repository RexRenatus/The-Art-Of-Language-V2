  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Root keys should never be used online due to compromise
    risks.'' Support your position with NIST SP 800-57 references, real-world examples like supply chain attacks (e.g., SolarWinds),
    and countermeasures. Identify trade-offs in accessibility vs. security.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    1. Semantic traps (similar terms, e.g., ''intermediate key'' instead of ''root key'').

    2. Conceptual errors (e.g., confuse symmetric/asymmetric roles).

    3. Extreme/overgeneralized options (e.g., ''never use root keys'' vs. ''use offline''). Ensure distractors are realistic
    from NIST docs or breaches.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  **Root Keys** (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cryptographic Solutions > Key Management
  > Key Types and Hierarchy > Root Keys). Use this optimized pedagogy:


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives above].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Weave in discussion/peer-teaching/problem-solving hints in explanations.


  **Scaffolding:** Generate 20-30 flashcards distributed: 5-7 per layer (use exact Layer 1-4 content above).


  **Research Context (Completed):** Root keys are top-level trust anchors deriving/protecting others (NIST SP 800-57 Part
  1 Rev 5: ''Provides general guidance... key management lifecycle. Root keys, as critical components of key management, ensure
  hierarchical trust via derivation/protection, with strict offline generation/storage in HSMs.''). Emphasize compromise risks
  (total failure, e.g., SolarWinds). Prerequisites: Basic crypto.


  **Concept Map:** ROOT KEY → derives INTERMEDIATE KEYS → END-USER KEYS; links: TRUST ANCHOR, KEY LIFECYCLE, NIST FRAMEWORK.


  **Output:** JSON array of flashcards, each following exact **Flashcard Schema** above. Cover all Bloom''s levels/objectives
  evenly. Ensure university-level rigor: active recall, spaced repetition friendly. No adult/offensive content. Voter consensus:
  67.1% approval on pedagogy/scaffolding/completeness.'
