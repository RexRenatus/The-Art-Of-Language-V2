active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Key-wrapping keys eliminate the need for other key protection
    mechanisms.'' Use NIST SP 800-38F standards and real-world examples like AWS KMS breaches to support your arguments, considering
    cascade effects in key hierarchies.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Key-Wrapping Keys (Topic\
  \ Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cryptographic Solutions > Key Management > Key Types\
