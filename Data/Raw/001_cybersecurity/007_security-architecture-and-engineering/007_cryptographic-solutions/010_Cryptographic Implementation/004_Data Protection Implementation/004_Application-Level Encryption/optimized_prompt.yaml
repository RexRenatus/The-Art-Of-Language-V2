active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of application-level encryption versus transport-level
    encryption (e.g., TLS) for protecting sensitive user data in a messaging app. Consider scenarios where one fails and the
    other succeeds, referencing data states and NIST guidelines. Synthesize group consensus on when to use each.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Research Context (Complete Summary):** Application-level encryption protects data at the app layer (e.g., E2EE messaging
  like Signal, field-level DB encryption), distinct from transport-level (TLS channel protection). Core: Encryption (plaintext
  to ciphertext via key), decryption, keys, cipher suites (key exchange/auth/encrypt/MAC algos), hashing (integrity, one-way).
  Data states: At rest (DB/files/backups; app encrypts fields/volumes), in transit (app E2EE beyond TLS), in use (memory;
  homomorphic/confidential computing). Data classification: Public/confidential/highly confidential. NIST SP 800-57: Part
  1 (intro), Part 2 (key mgmt basics: gen/dist/rot/store/destroy), Part 3 (app-specific guidance: transport protocols (TLS/IPsec),
  wireless, key wrapping/derivation; extensible to apps). Best practices: Use libs (OpenSSL/libsodium), HSMs, rotate keys.

  **Pedagogy Integration:** Use provided Learning Objectives (Bloom''s: Remember/Understand/Apply/Analyze/Evaluate/Create),
  Active Learning (discussion/peer/problem-solving), Scaffolding (4 layers: Foundation/Components/Implementation/Integration).
  Prior knowledge: Link to symmetric/asymmetric, keys, hashing.


  **Generate Flashcards:** Follow Flashcard Schema exactly. Output JSON array of objects: [{''type'': ''basic|mcq|cloze'',
  ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffold_layer'': ''1-4'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''source'': ''...''}]. Ensure 40-60 cards, balanced coverage, accurate/complete (no truncation), distractors per protocol.
  Promote active recall, critical thinking.'
