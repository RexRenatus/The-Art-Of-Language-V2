active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the vulnerabilities exploited in SSL stripping (e.g., lack of HSTS enforcement) and debate whether
    modern browsers and HSTS fully mitigate it. Cite real-world examples like attacks on public Wi-Fi (e.g., Moxie Marlinspike's
    2009 demo) and address misconceptions such as 'HTTPS is always safe' or 'HSTS is universally deployed'.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    vs. ''only enforces HTTPS after first visit''); 2) Partial truths (e.g., ''Uses ARP spoofing only'' omitting proxy); 3)
    Confusions with similar attacks (e.g., mix with Heartbleed or BEAST); 4) Outdated info (e.g., pre-HSTS assumptions). Ensure
    distractors are realistic for cybersecurity learners.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education on ''SSL Stripping'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cryptographic Solutions > Cryptanalysis and Attacks > Protocol-Level Attacks >
  SSL Stripping). Voter consensus (100% approval) emphasizes completeness (add HSTS/RFC 6797, NIST SP 800-52, OWASP MitM,
  Expect-CT, certificate pinning, Marlinspike''s 2009 demo) and pedagogy (Bloom''s progression, active learning, 4-layer scaffolding).


  Incorporate these EXACT elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: [paste the active_learning object here]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste the scaffolding_layers array here]

  - Flashcard Schema: Strictly follow [paste the flashcard_schema here].


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards (10 per Bloom''s pair: Remember/Understand, Apply/Analyze, Evaluate/Create) spanning
  all scaffolding layers. Ensure 100% coverage: 30% foundations/mitigations/standards, 20% attack steps/tools, 20% comparisons/real-world,
  15% misconceptions, 15% creation/evaluation.


  Research Context: SSL stripping is MitM downgrade from HTTPS to HTTP via interception (ARP spoofing, sslstrip tool). Steps:
  Intercept, HTTP to victim, HTTPS proxy to server, rewrite links. Mitigations: HSTS, Preload, pinning. Sources: Moxie Marlinspike
  (ssllabs/Black Hat), OWASP, NIST SP 800-52.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''id'':1, ''bloom_level'':''Remember'', ''scaffolding_layer'':1, ''front'':''Question?
  A)opt1 B)opt2 C)opt3 D)opt4'', ''back'':''**Correct: B** Explanation...'', ''tags'':[''MitM'',''HSTS'']}, ...]. No extra
