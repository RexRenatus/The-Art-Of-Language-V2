active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss the AWS Shared Responsibility Model and how FSBP addresses common misconceptions (e.g., 'AWS
    secures everything'). In groups, debate the impact of ignoring FSBP domains like Logging and Monitoring on overall security
    posture.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
