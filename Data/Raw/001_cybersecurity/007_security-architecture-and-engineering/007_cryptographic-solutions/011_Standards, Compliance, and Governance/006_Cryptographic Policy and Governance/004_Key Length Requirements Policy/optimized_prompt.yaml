learning_objectives:
  remember:
  - objective: Define key length and list NIST-recommended minimums for symmetric (e.g., AES-128 for 128-bit security) and
      asymmetric keys (e.g., RSA 3072 for 128-bit security).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  understand:
  - objective: Explain the relationship between key length and security strength, including how security strength (bits of
      security) differs from raw key length due to algorithm-specific attacks.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  create:
  - objective: Formulate a key length policy for an organization, incorporating cryptoperiods, security lifetimes, and future-proofing
      against quantum threats.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  analyze:
  - objective: Compare key length requirements across algorithm types (symmetric vs. asymmetric) using NIST SP 800-57 tables.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  evaluate:
  - objective: Critique a sample policy for compliance with NIST SP 800-57 and SP 800-131A, identifying gaps in acceptable
      vs. legacy/disallowed algorithms.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Select appropriate key lengths for given cryptographic use cases, such as choosing AES-256 for high-security
      data in transit.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
