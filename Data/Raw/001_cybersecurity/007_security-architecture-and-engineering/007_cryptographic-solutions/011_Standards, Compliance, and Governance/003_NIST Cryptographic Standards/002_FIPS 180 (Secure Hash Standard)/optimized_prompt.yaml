active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given the evolution of FIPS 180 from SHA-1 to SHA-512 and integration with SHA-3, debate the trade-offs
    between hash function security strength (e.g., resistance to collision attacks), performance (e.g., speed on hardware),
    and compatibility (e.g., legacy systems) in modern cryptographic applications. Support arguments with real-world examples
    like TLS certificates, blockchain integrity checks, or federal compliance requirements.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Topic Context:**

  - Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cryptographic Solutions > Standards, Compliance, and
  Governance > NIST Cryptographic Standards > FIPS 180.

  - Key Facts: FIPS 180-4 (2015) specifies SHA-1 (deprecated), SHA-2 (224/256/384/512), SHA-3. Ensures integrity via one-way
  hash functions. PDF: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf.

  - Prior Knowledge: One-way functions, digital signatures, integrity.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives from above].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers from above].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Weave in hooks to discussion (trade-offs), peer teaching (padding), problem-solving (hash
  verification).


  **Generate 50 flashcards** using the exact schema:

  - Balance: 10 per layer, spanning Bloom''s levels.

  - Schema: {''front'': ''Question'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''... (link to objective/layer/real-world)'',
  ''references'': ''...'', ''active_hook'': ''...''}}.

  - Distractors: 3 plausible per MCQ per protocol.

  - Ensure measurable, precise verbs. Make explanations educational (why correct/wrong). Output ONLY valid JSON array.'
