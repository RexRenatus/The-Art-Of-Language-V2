  Generate high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized flashcards using university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (objectives:
  [insert learning_objectives array]), active learning ([insert active_learning JSON]), scaffolding layers ([insert scaffolding
  JSON]). Ensure completeness: GDPR (extraterritorial, 72h breach, DPIA, 4% fines, rights); CCPA/CPRA (CA thresholds, opt-out
  sale/sharing, 45-day requests, notices/contracts, $7,500 fines, CPPA enforcement).


  Output ONLY in JSON: {''flashcards'': [array of objects]}, each object: {''layer'': ''1-4 name'', ''bloom_level'': ''REMEMBER/etc.'',
  ''type'': ''Q&A/MCQ/cloze/scenario'', ''front'': ''question text'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''distractors'': [array if MCQ], ''reference'': ''GDPR Art. X / objective Y''}}.


  Follow schema exactly: [insert flashcard_schema JSON]. Distribute evenly across layers/Bloom''s/objectives. Include 2-3
  formative MCQs/short-answer per layer mimicking active learning (e.g., breach scenario). Link to crypto (e.g., encryption
  mandates). Make engaging, precise, error-free.'
