active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the reasons why SAFER was used in early Bluetooth (E0 cipher) but later
    replaced by AES in modern standards. Consider trade-offs in speed, security, and implementation complexity, supporting
    arguments with historical context and attack analyses.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
