active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare RC5's parameter flexibility (w, r, b) with AES's fixed parameters. Discuss trade-offs in security
    (e.g., data-dependent rotations vs. S-boxes), performance (e.g., software efficiency), and implementation complexity for
    modern applications like legacy system migration.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate university pedagogy: Align to provided learning_objectives (span Bloom''s: Remember/Understand/Apply/Analyze/Evaluate/Create).
  Use scaffolding layers (1:Foundation prereqs like bitwise ops/Feistel; 2:Components params w/r/b/key expansion; 3:Implementation
  pseudocode/samples; 4:Integration security/modes/history RFC2040/Rivest1995/AES). Embed active learning: Tie questions to
  discussion (RC5 vs AES trade-offs), peer teaching (explain rounds), problem-solving (Python impl/analysis).


  Research context: RC5 (Rivest 1994/1995) symmetric block cipher; params w(16/32/64), r(12-16), b(0-256); 2w-bit blocks;
  key expansion Pw/Qw from e/φ; data-dependent rotations; Feistel-like; historical (RSA BSAFE, AES candidate); deprecated
  for AES; modes CBC/etc.


  Follow flashcard_schema exactly: 50 cards in JSON array. Varied types (Q&A/cloze/MCQ); MCQs with 3 distractors per protocol;
  back includes answer/explanation/bloom_reference/hints/sources. Ensure completeness (standards: RFC2040; sources: Rivest
  paper). Scaffolding progression: 20% Layer1, 30% Layer2, 30% Layer3, 20% Layer4. Promote active recall, avoid trivia. Output
  ONLY the JSON array.'
