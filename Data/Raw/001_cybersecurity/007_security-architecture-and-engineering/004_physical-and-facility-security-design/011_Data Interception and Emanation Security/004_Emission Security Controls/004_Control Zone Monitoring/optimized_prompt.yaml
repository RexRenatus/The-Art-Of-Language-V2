active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between granular control zone monitoring in emission security (e.g., TEMPEST zones)
    versus traditional perimeter security models. Reference NSTISSAM TEMPEST/2-95 and CNSS Policy 6-1—what are the risks if
    monitoring is not continuous, such as undetected compromising emanations leading to data interception?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors from: 1) Common misconceptions (physical vs. logical zones, ZTA microsegmentation
    mix-up). 2) Related but incorrect standards (e.g., NIST 800-207 instead of TEMPEST/2-95). 3) Partial truths (e.g., ''perimeter-only
    monitoring'' vs. continuous). Ensure plausibility for active recall testing. Aim for 60% MCQ, 40% short answer/cloze.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university-style pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Control Zone Monitoring''
  (Category: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Physical and Facility Security Design > Data Interception
  and Emanation Security > Emission Security Controls > Control Zone Monitoring).


  **Corrected Topic Summary (Accuracy-Aligned):** Control Zone Monitoring focuses on continuous surveillance of physical control
  zones to prevent compromising emanations (e.g., electromagnetic, acoustic) in emission security (EMSEC/TEMPEST). Control
  zones are physically defined areas classified by sensitivity: RED (unencrypted equipment), BLACK (encrypted/classified),
  Orange (buffer/transition). Monitoring ensures shielding effectiveness and compliance via tools like spectrum analyzers.
  Key standards: NSTISSAM TEMPEST/2-95 (zone classifications, tests), CNSS Policy 6-1 (EMSEC), NATO SDIP-27/29, NIST SP 800-53
  (SC-39), NIST SP 800-137A (ISCM). Prevents passive interception; builds on RED/BLACK separation.

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the exact ''scaffolding'' array from above]. Use these to structure coverage.


  **Active Learning Integration:** Draw from [insert ''active_learning'' object] for scenario-based cards (e.g., debate trade-offs
  in analysis cards, design exercises in create cards).


  **Flashcard Generation:** Produce exactly 30 flashcards following the schema: {front, back: {answer, explanation, distractors},
  metadata: {bloom_level, scaffolding_layer, tags}}. Balance: 5 per Bloom''s level. Use distractor protocol. Ensure accuracy:
  Avoid ZTA/network focus; emphasize physical/EMSEC. Output as a JSON array of flashcards. Make explanations educational,
  linking to objectives/scaffolding/standards for deep learning.'
