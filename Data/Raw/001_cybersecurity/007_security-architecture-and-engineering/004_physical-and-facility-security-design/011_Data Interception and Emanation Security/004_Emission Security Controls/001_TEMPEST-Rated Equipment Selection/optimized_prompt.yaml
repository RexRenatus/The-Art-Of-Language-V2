active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a government agency with budget constraints, debate whether to invest in full TEMPEST-rated equipment
    or implement alternative countermeasures like increased inspectable space, filtering, or hybrid shielding. What factors
    (e.g., classification level, risks, costs) decide the best approach? Support with standards like NSTISSAM TEMPEST/02-01.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use elements to inspire scenario-based cards (e.g., debate trade-offs, SCIF design).

  - Scaffolding: Structure flashcards across 4 layers with transitions; label each card with Layer # and Bloom''s level.


  Generate flashcards per this schema: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD SCHEMA FROM ABOVE].


  Content Sources: Integrate voter priorities (e.g., steps, standards, zoning), research (CEs, RED/BLACK, Inspectable Space,
  CTTAs, NSTISSAM TEMPEST/02-01, CNSSAM TEMPEST/01-13, NSA levels A/B/I/II, Zones 0/1/2, SCIF/SAPF).


  Output ONLY a numbered list of flashcards in JSON: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''layer'':
  ''1'', ''blooms_level'': ''Remember''}]. Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, misconceptions addressed.'
