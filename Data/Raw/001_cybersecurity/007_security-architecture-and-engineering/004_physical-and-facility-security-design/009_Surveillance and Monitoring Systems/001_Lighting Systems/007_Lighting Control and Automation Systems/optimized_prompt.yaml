active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In critical facilities like hospitals or data centers, do the energy savings from CLS justify the cybersecurity
    risks? Debate pros/cons using standards like ANSI/UL 2900-1 and DLC NLC5, and propose balanced strategies incorporating
    FedRAMP for cloud integrations.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, Student A explains CLS/OT concepts, risks (e.g., IoT attack vectors like Mirai), and IT/OT distinctions
    to Student B using diagrams; Student B teaches back relevant standards (ANSI/UL 2900-1, DLC NLC5, FedRAMP). Switch roles
    and address misconceptions like 'lighting systems are always offline.'
  problem_solving: Design a secure lighting control system for a smart office building. Identify 3 vulnerabilities (e.g.,
    weak network interfaces), apply mitigations from DLC NLC5/ANSI standards, simulate a risk assessment, and integrate with
    surveillance systems.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per card: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''CLS are always offline''),
    2) Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., confuses OT with IT), 3) Related but incorrect concept (e.g., mixes with non-lighting
    IoT). Ensure distractors test nuance from research context and objectives. Balance 70% MCQ, 30% short answer/cloze.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality, optimized flashcards for the topic ''Lighting
  Control and Automation Systems'' (Category: Cybersecurity, Domain: Security Architecture And Engineering, Subdomain: Physical
  and Facility Security Design, Entry: Surveillance and Monitoring Systems > Lighting Systems).


  **Topic Hierarchy:** Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Physical and Facility Security Design > Surveillance
  and Monitoring Systems > Lighting Systems > Lighting Control and Automation Systems.


  **Research Context:** CLS/NLC are IoT-enabled OT systems for energy-efficient lighting with distributed intelligence, sensors,
  controllers. Risks: unauthorized access, breaches, IT attack vectors (e.g., Mirai botnet). Standards: ANSI/UL 2900-1 (IoT
  cybersecurity), DLC NLC5 (networked lighting security), FedRAMP (cloud service authorization relevant for CLS integrations).
  FRCS integration. Sources: designlights.org, energy.gov, ul.com/standards.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the learning_objectives array here].


  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Incorporate concepts from discussion (risk vs. savings), peer teaching (OT risks/standards),
  problem-solving (design mitigations).


  **Scaffolding:** Flashcards progress via 4 layers: [Insert scaffolding_layers here].


  **Output:** JSON array of 30 flashcards, each matching the exact schema: {front, options (array of 4), correct_answer (letter),
  bloom_level, scaffolding_layer (1-4), explanation, source}. Use distractor protocol strictly. Ensure variety: MCQ for analysis/eval,
  cloze for remember. Test misconceptions (e.g., lighting offline). Promote active recall and spaced repetition.'
