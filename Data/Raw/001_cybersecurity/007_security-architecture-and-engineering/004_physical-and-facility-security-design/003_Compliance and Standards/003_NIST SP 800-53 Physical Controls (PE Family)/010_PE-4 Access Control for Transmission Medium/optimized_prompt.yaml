active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In small groups, discuss real-world threats to transmission media (e.g., tampering by insiders, accidental
    damage during maintenance) and evaluate how PE-4 mitigates them within the CIA triad. Relate to prior knowledge of PE-2/PE-3
    and propose optimizations like surveillance integration.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    controls); 2) Partial truth/related control (e.g., mix with PE-2/PE-3 elements); 3) Extreme/opposite (e.g., ''no controls
    needed'' or unrelated threat). Ensure distractors test analysis (e.g., dependencies) and avoid obvious wrongs.'

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full array from above]

  - Active Learning: [insert summaries]

  - Scaffolding: [insert full 4 layers with concept map, prior knowledge, big picture, completed sections like Regular Reviews
  (periodic inspections, access logs review, audits, maintenance), Best Practices (physical safeguards vs. damage/disruption/tampering),
  Sources (NIST: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final; CCCS ITSG-33 Annex 3A: https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/...;

  Generate flashcards per exact schema: [insert full schema]. Ensure progressive coverage (Layer 1: 10 cards foundation/remember;
  Layer 2: components/understand; Layer 3: implementation/apply; Layer 4: integration/analyze-evaluate-create). Incorporate
  voter priorities: completeness (full reviews/sources), pedagogy (measurable verbs, Bloom''s progression), concept map in
  explanations. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''front'':..., ''back'':{...}}]. No extra text.'
