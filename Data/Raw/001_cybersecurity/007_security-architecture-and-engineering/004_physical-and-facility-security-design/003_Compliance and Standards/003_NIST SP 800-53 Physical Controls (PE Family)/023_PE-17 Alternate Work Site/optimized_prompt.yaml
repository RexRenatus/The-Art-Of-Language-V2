active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains the key PE-17 controls (access control, physical locking, encryption via SC-13/SC-28)
    using a hand-drawn diagram of an alternate site layout. The partner then teach-backs by quizzing the explainer and adding
    one real-world example or misconception (e.g., VPN alone does not replace physical controls). Switch roles.
  problem_solving: In groups of 3-4, design a home office security checklist compliant with PE-17, including access restrictions,
    locking mechanisms, and audit procedures. Conduct a mock audit on a peer group's checklist, scoring it on completeness
    and identifying gaps, then iterate based on feedback.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (30% of cards): Generate 3 plausible distractors based on: 1. Common misconceptions (e.g.,
    ''VPN suffices without locks''); 2. Related but incorrect controls (e.g., PE-3 primary only); 3. Partial truths (e.g.,
    ''Public cafes qualify as controlled areas''). Ensure distractors teach by contrast.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST SP 800-53. Generate
