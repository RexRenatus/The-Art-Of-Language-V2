    Is the ~22 hours annual downtime acceptable for a financial services data center? Consider cost vs. risk trade-offs and
    real-world priorities like DoS prevention from power failures.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Uptime Institute Tier Standards
  within Security Architecture and Engineering. Topic Hierarchy: Level 1: Cybersecurity > Level 2: Security Architecture And
  Engineering > Level 3: Physical and Facility Security Design > Level 4: Compliance and Standards > Level 5: Uptime Institute
  Tier Standards > Level 6: Tier II: Redundant Capacity Components.


  Core Content (from research): Tier II features N+1 redundant capacity components (engine generators, UPS modules, chillers,
  cooling units, pumps, heat rejection equipment) with single distribution path; 99.741% uptime (~22 hours/year downtime);
  allows maintenance but requires shutdowns. Prior Knowledge: Tier I (no redundancy). Frameworks: Supports ISO 27001 (A.11/A.17
  availability), NIST CSF. Sources: Uptime Institute Tier Standard: Topology (uptimeinstitute.com/tiers).
