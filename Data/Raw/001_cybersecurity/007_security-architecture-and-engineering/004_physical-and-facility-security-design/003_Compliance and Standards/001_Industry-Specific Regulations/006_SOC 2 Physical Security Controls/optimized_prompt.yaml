active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how SOC 2 physical security controls (CC6.4) address real-world threats
    like tailgating or insider threats in a shared data center. Connect to the CIA triad and propose one improvement for a
    hypothetical non-compliant facility.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs based on common errors: 1. Confuse physical with logical access (e.g., ''passwords''
      instead of ''badges''); 2. Wrong CC6 number (e.g., CC6.3 instead of 6.4); 3. Misalign standards (e.g., NIST 800-53 AU
      instead of PE); 4. Over/under-state scope (e.g., ignore visitor logs).'
    - Ensure distractors are realistic from research context (e.g., truncated AICPA sources emphasize CC6.4 facilities).
    example:
      stem: What does SOC 2 CC6.4 require?
      correct: Restrict physical access to facilities and assets to authorized personnel.
      distractors:
      - Implement multi-factor authentication for logins (logical mix-up)
      - Monitor logical access logs only (CC6.2 confusion)
      - Encrypt data at rest (confuses with Confidentiality TSC)
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in SOC 2 Physical Security
  Controls (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Physical and Facility Security Design
  > Compliance and Standards > Industry-Specific Regulations > SOC 2 Physical Security Controls). Use the provided learning
  objectives, active learning components, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema to create optimized Anki-style flashcards
  promoting Bloom''s progression, active recall, and spaced repetition.


  Key Content Sources: AICPA SOC 2 TSC (CC6.1: secure architectures; CC6.2: user access; CC6.4: physical access restrictions
  to facilities/data centers/backup media); NIST SP 800-53 (PE family); ISO 27001 (A.11 Physical/Environmental); best practices
  (perimeters, CCTV, badges, logs, tailgating prevention, equipment maintenance). Prior knowledge: CIA triad, basic access
  controls.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives for measurable outcomes.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across Layers 1-4.

  - Active elements: Embed discussion/problem-solving hooks in scenario cards.

  - Schema: Q/A, MCQs (distractors per protocol), cloze, scenarios; each with explanation + metadata (Bloom level, Layer,
  Type).


  Generate exactly 40 flashcards in JSON array format: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'',
  ''layer'': 1-4, ''type'': ''...''}]. Ensure completeness (no truncations), pedagogy (higher-order thinking), and misconceptions
  addressed. Vary difficulty progressively.'
