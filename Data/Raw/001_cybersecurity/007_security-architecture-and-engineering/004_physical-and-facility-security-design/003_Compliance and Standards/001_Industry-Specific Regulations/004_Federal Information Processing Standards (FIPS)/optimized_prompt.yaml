  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the big-picture role of FIPS as the foundation for federal cybersecurity
    frameworks: How do FIPS 199 and 200 promote interoperability and compliance in national security architecture? Provide
    real-world examples of FIPS non-compliance leading to breaches (e.g., in federal agencies) and propose mitigations using
    FIPS 140 for crypto.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate this full context:

  - Topic Hierarchy: Level1 Cybersecurity, L2 Security Architecture&Engineering, L3 Physical/Facility Security Design, L4
  Compliance/Standards, L5 Industry-Specific Regs, L6 FIPS.

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Scaffolding: [insert full 4 layers above].

  - Active Learning: Use to inspire scenario-based cards.

  - Prior knowledge: Assume NIST basics, CIA, SDLC known.

  - Completeness: Cover FIPS 199 (categorization: CIA low/mod/high), FIPS 200 (17 families incl. PE), FIPS 140-3 (crypto levels).

  - Big picture: FIPS foundation for federal compliance/interoperability.


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards per EXACT schema: JSON array of objects with ''front'' (question/MCQ) and ''back'' {answer,
  explanation (cite NIST/FIPS, link to layer/objective), bloom_level, scaffolding_layer, tags}. Follow types/distractor protocol
  strictly. Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, no hints on front. Align to Bloom''s progression
  and scaffolding. Output ONLY the JSON array.'
