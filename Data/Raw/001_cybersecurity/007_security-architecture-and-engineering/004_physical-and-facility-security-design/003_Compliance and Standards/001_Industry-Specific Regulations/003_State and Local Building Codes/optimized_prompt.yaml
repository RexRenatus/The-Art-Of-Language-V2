active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare building codes in two different states (e.g., California vs. Texas) regarding requirements for
    secure access to sensitive areas like data centers. How do variations impact cybersecurity physical protections, such
    as mantrap installations or fire-rated walls, and what strategies can mitigate inconsistencies?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 distractors per MCQ flashcard.
    - 'Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., confuse state vs. federal codes).'
    - 'Distractor 2: Plausible but incorrect detail (e.g., wrong NFPA standard).'
    - 'Distractor 3: Overgeneralization (e.g., assume uniform national codes).'
    - Ensure distractors are realistic, derived from voter-noted mismatches or web research (e.g., non-cybersecurity building
      code aspects).
    - 'Balance: 60% MCQ, 20% cloze deletion, 20% short answer.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in CISSP Domain 3: Security
  Architecture and Engineering, Physical and Facility Security Design, Compliance and Standards (Industry-Specific Regulations:
  State and Local Building Codes).


  Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Physical and Facility Security Design > Compliance
  and Standards > Industry-Specific Regulations > State and Local Building Codes.


  Refocus: Despite general construction focus, emphasize security-relevant aspects (fire safety NFPA 75/76, access/egress
  IBC, data center structural needs) intersecting with NIST SP 800-53 PE controls, UFC 4-010-01, Zero Trust physical, SSDLC.
