active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the real-world consequences of neglecting Device and Media Controls in
    a hospital (e.g., lost USB drives with ePHI). How do these physical safeguards intersect with technical safeguards like
    encryption? Support your points with HIPAA §164.310 references and propose preventive measures.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (40% of cards): Create 3 distractors that are plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g.,
    confuse Workstation Use policy with Security physical controls; mix required/addressable specs; swap with Admin/Tech safeguards).
    Ensure one is a near-miss from another standard, one from non-HIPAA regs (OSHA), one overly broad/general.'

  Generate 40-50 high-quality, spaced-repetition-optimized flashcards per the schema [insert flashcard_schema]. Cover all
  objectives/layers proportionally. Ensure web-grounded accuracy: Physical Safeguards protect ePHI via §164.310 (sources:
