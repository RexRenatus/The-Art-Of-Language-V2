        "core_logic": "Visitor control, as defined in PE-2, is essential for loading dock security because it ensures that all individuals entering the facility, including those accessing loading docks, are identified, authorized, and tracked.",

        "analogy": "It's like a receptionist at a building who checks IDs and logs visitors before allowing them entry, ensuring everyone who enters is accounted for."
