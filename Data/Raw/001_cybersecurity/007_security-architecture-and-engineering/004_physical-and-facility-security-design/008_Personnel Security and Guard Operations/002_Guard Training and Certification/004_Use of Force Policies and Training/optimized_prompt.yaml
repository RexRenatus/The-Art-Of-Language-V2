active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a data center protecting critical national infrastructure, an armed intruder bypasses outer perimeter
    security. Debate the circumstances under which security personnel should escalate from non-lethal to lethal force, considering
    legal standards (e.g., Graham v. Connor), ethical implications, and cybersecurity protection priorities such as preventing
    data exfiltration.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Distractors must be plausible based on common misconceptions: 1) Over-escalation (e.g., jumping to
    lethal force too soon), 2) Under-escalation (ignoring threat), 3) Misaligned standards (confusing ASIS with law enforcement
    POST). Ground in research (e.g., wrong PE control numbers, incomplete continuum levels). Ensure 1 distractor is a ''near-miss''
    (adjacent continuum level).'
