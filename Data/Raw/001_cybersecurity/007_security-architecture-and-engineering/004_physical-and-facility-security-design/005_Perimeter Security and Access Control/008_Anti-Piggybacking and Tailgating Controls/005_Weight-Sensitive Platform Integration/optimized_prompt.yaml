active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using weight-sensitive platforms versus camera-based
    AI detection for anti-tailgating in a data center entrance. Consider cost, reliability in low-light conditions, privacy
    implications, and compliance with standards like BS EN 50133. Provide evidence-based arguments and propose a hybrid solution.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
