        "core_logic": "The RCMP guide specifies a minimum fence height of 2.4 meters (8 feet) for 'security fencing' because fences below this height, even with toppings, offer minimal delay and can be easily overcome. This height functions by making climbing significantly more difficult and increasing the risk of injury, thus contributing to the fence's role as a substantial physical barrier rather than just a visual deterrent.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors suggest heights that are either too low for effective delay or higher than the specified minimum, failing to identify the threshold for 'security fencing'.",
        "analogy": "A 2.4-meter fence is like a wall that requires tools or significant effort to climb. A shorter fence is like a low barrier that can be easily stepped over."
