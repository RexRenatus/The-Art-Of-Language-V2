active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of selecting a facility site in a remote area (lower cyber/physical
    threat density but potentially poor emergency services) versus an urban location (better services but higher risks). Use
    real-world examples and justify your position with risk metrics like response times.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    types:
    - Common misconceptions (e.g., confusing cyber PSAP security with physical proximity)
    - Related but incorrect terms (e.g., 'NG9-1-1 uptime' instead of 'fire station distance')
    - Edge cases (e.g., urban vs. rural benchmarks swapped)
    - Plausible alternatives (e.g., secondary factors like terrain over primary proximity)
    quality: Realistic, derived from mismatched research contexts or voter-noted errors; ensure they test deeper understanding
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  ''Local Emergency Services Availability'' under hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Physical
  and Facility Security Design > Physical Security Planning and Governance > Site Selection and Facility Planning > Local
  Emergency Services Availability.


  CRITICAL: Focus EXCLUSIVELY on PHYSICAL security aspects—evaluating proximity, response times, access, and capabilities
  of local fire/police/EMS during site selection. AVOID cybersecurity for NG9-1-1/PSAPs; that''s a mismatch.

  - Scaffolding: [insert full 4 layers above]

  - Active learning ties: Reference in explanations.

  - Research context: Physical best practices (e.g., ASIS site selection guidelines, NFPA 4-6 min response benchmarks, GIS
  for proximity; integrate with BCP/risk assessment).
