  discussion_prompt: 'Debate: Does achieving compliance with NIST CSF guarantee effective physical security in a remote facility?
    Use real-world case studies (e.g., data centers or hospitals) to argue pros/cons, referencing CIA Triad impacts and regulatory
    gaps.'
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student teaches a regulatory framework (e.g., GDPR physical safeguards or NIST 800-53 PE controls)
    to their partner, including a mapping example; the partner summarizes, critiques for gaps, and teaches back a related
    framework like ISO 27001 A.11.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A hospital is expanding facilities. Groups map compliance requirements across HIPAA (physical
    safeguards), NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001 for controls like access, surveillance, and power redundancy; identify gaps and
    propose mitigations using tools like spreadsheets.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert cybersecurity educator and flashcard generator specializing in (ISC)² domains. Generate
  25 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Compliance and Regulatory Mapping'' (Category: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture
  And Engineering > Physical and Facility Security Design > Physical Security Planning and Governance > Policy and Procedures
  Development > Compliance and Regulatory Mapping). Consensus-approved (67.1%) with voter priorities: completeness (full CIA
  Triad with physical ex: Confidentiality-locked rooms, Integrity-tamper seals, Availability-redundant power), pedagogy (Bloom''s,
  active learning inspo), scaffolding, measurable outcomes.


  Incorporate research: Cybersecurity compliance aligns controls with regs/frameworks (NIST CSF/800-53 PE, ISO 27001 A.11,
  HIPAA/GDPR physical safeguards, FISMA, OSHA, NFPA 75). Big picture: Ensures physical supports digital security for risk
  mgmt/certifications.


  Use provided learning_objectives (span Remember to Create), active_learning (inspire scenario-based Qs), scaffolding_layers
  (5 cards/layer), flashcard_schema exactly (MCQ 4 opts, distractors per protocol, explanations w/ links).


  Ensure coverage: 70% physical-specific (e.g., access/surveillance mappings), 30% general cyber ties. Prerequisites: Risk
  assessment. Related: Policy dev. Concept map inspo: Central Compliance Mapping → Physical Controls/Regs/Frameworks/Audits.
