active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate whether cloud-based alternate sites (e.g., multi-region AWS setups) fully satisfy NIST SP 800-53
    Rev. 5 CP-7 geographic separation requirements compared to traditional physical sites. Use real-world examples like the
    2021 AWS us-east-1 outage to support your arguments, and discuss trade-offs in cost, resilience, and compliance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² CISSP domains. Topic:
  Alternate Site Requirements Definition (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Physical and
  Facility Security Design > Physical Security Planning and Governance > Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Integration
  > Alternate Site Requirements Definition). Use this context: Core concepts from NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 CP-7 include geographic
  separation, resource availability, equivalent controls, agreements. Related controls: CP-2 (Continuity), CP-3 (Testing),
  CP-4 (Training), PE-12 (Perimeter). Sources: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final. Prior knowledge: BCP/DRP
  basics. Big picture: Enhances resilience in finance/healthcare.
