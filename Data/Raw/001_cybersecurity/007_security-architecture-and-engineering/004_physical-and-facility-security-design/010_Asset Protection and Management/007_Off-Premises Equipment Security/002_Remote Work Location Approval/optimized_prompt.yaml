active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of approving home-based remote work versus co-working spaces
    under Zero Trust Architecture. Consider physical security risks (e.g., CCTV absence at home) versus network segmentation
    benefits. Reference NIST SP 800-53 PE controls and justify positions with voter-approved risk comparisons.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (40% of cards): Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions from research/voter
    input. Examples: (1) Confuse personal vs. state-owned assets, (2) Misapply ZTA as ''perimeter-based'', (3) Ignore CISA
    TIC 3.0 remote emphasis, (4) Overstate physical controls without ZTA. Ensure distractors are research-grounded (e.g.,
    outdated VPN-only trust) but incorrect. Mark correct answer clearly.'
