active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss common misconceptions about fiber optic security (e.g., 'fiber optics are immune to all physical
    attacks because they use light') and use evidence from NIST standards and real-world examples (e.g., detectable signal
    loss from bends) to explain why physical protections are still essential. How does this integrate physical and logical
    security in cybersecurity architecture?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Only EMI affects fiber''), 3) Plausible opposite/error (e.g., ''Taps cause no signal
    loss''). Ensure plausible for mid-level learners; avoid obvious wrongs.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  Fiber Optic Cable Physical Security (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Physical and Facility
  Security Design > Asset Protection and Management > Cabling Security > Fiber Optic Cable Physical Security). Use this comprehensive
  content to generate 50 high-quality flashcards (20 MCQ, 15 cloze, 15 Q&A) optimized for spaced repetition and active recall.


  **Core Content (Scaffolding Layers, Prior Knowledge, etc.):**

  [Insert full ''scaffolding'' object here, including prior_knowledge, layers 1-4, misconceptions, big picture].


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full ''learning_objectives'' array]. Ensure ~8-10 cards per Bloom''s level, progressing
  from low to high.


  **Active Learning Integration:** Phrase questions to mimic activities (e.g., ''Critique this design...'' for evaluation;
  scenario-based for problem-solving).


  **Sources:** NIST SP 800-53 (PE controls), ISO 27001, CISA cable security alerts, OTDR for detection.


  **Output Format:** Strictly a JSON array matching the ''flashcard_schema'' structure. Balance across layers/objectives.
  Vary difficulty; include real-world scenarios (e.g., data center design). No additional text outside JSON.'
