active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a resource-constrained startup, should priority be given to equipment anchoring, surveillance cameras,
    or access controls for theft prevention? Debate pros, cons, trade-offs, and evidence from standards like NIST SP 800-53
    PE controls.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    generation_rules: Base on real standards (e.g., distractors from adjacent NIST families like AC, IA); avoid random guesses;
      test plausibility against sources.
