active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student teaches the hazmat response steps (e.g., ERG zone establishment, decontamination) to
    their partner using analogies from facility security (e.g., treating a hazmat spill like isolating a network segment).
    Switch roles and provide feedback on clarity and accuracy.
  problem_solving: In small groups, design an integrated response plan for a hazmat incident (e.g., ammonia leak from HVAC
    in a server farm) occurring simultaneously with a cybersecurity breach. Identify roles, communication protocols, and recovery
    steps, then present and peer-review for OSHA/NFPA compliance.

    but incorrect terms (e.g., Class 3 flammable solids instead of liquids); 3) Overgeneralizations (e.g., cyber IR phases
    for hazmat); 4) Outdated/misremembered standards (e.g., pre-OSHA rules). Ensure 60% highly plausible to test deep understanding.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for ''Hazardous Material Incident Response'' in the context of Cybersecurity
  > Security Architecture And Engineering > Physical and Facility Security Design > Incident Response and Recovery > Emergency
  Response Planning. Focus on physical hazmat protocols (OSHA 1910.120, NFPA 472, FEMA ERG, EPA guidelines) integrated with
  secure facility security (e.g., data centers), avoiding pure cyber IR conflation.

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full array above]

  - Active Learning: Use for scenario-based cards (e.g., discussion debates as prompts).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers – label each with layer.
