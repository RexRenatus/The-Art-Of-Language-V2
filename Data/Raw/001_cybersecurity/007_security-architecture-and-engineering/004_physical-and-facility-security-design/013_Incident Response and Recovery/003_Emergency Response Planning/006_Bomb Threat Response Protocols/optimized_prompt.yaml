active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between immediate evacuation and conducting an on-site search
    in response to a bomb threat. Consider factors like threat credibility, facility type, and potential business impacts,
    referencing CISA guidelines. Synthesize consensus recommendations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MC: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Always evacuate immediately'' vs.
    eval-based decision); 2) Partial truth (e.g., includes one phase but omits coord with LE); 3) Plausible alternative (e.g.,
    cyber-focused response instead of physical). Ensure distractors are realistic, derived from real-world errors or incomplete
    knowledge. Balance difficulty: 60% Layer 1-2 (recall/understand), 30% Layer 3 (apply/analyze), 10% Layer 4 (evaluate/create).'
