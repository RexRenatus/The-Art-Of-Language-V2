active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: After a natural disaster damages a corporate data center, debate the top three facility damages most
    likely to compromise cybersecurity posture (e.g., HVAC failure leading to overheating servers vs. access control system
    destruction) and justify prioritization using NIST SP 800-37 RMF steps.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1 based on common misconception (e.g., confusing residual
    risk with inherent risk), 1 semantic (similar term, e.g., ''inherent risk'' vs. ''residual risk''), 1 unrelated but facility-relevant
    (e.g., ''cosmetic damage'' for high-impact scenarios). Ensure distractors test nuance without being obviously wrong.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security Architecture and
  Engineering (Physical and Facility Security Design) within Incident Response and Recovery (Recovery and Restoration). Topic:
  Facility Damage Assessment. Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Physical and Facility
  Security Design > Incident Response and Recovery > Recovery and Restoration > Facility Damage Assessment.

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list from JSON]

  - Active Learning: Use as inspiration for scenario-based cards (e.g., discussion debates in analysis Qs, peer examples in
  explanations).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [Insert full descriptions].


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following this exact schema:

  {front: "...", back: {answer: "...", explanation: "...", bloom_level: "...", layer: #, reference: "..."}}


  Adhere to Flashcard Schema [Insert full schema details]. Ensure cards build progressively, link to prerequisites (risk mgmt,
  physical security), and address voter priorities (e.g., non-examples, NIST integration). Output as a JSON array of flashcards.'
