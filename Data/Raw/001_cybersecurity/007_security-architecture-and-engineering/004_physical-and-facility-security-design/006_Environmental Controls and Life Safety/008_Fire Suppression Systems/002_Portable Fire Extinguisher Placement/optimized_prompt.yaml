active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a data center environment, debate the trade-offs of placing fire extinguishers near server racks (for
    quick access to protect IT assets) versus along main aisles (for evacuation compliance). How does this align with NFPA
    10 and cybersecurity defense-in-depth?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors:

    1. Common misconception (e.g., ''no height limit'' vs. actual specs).

    2. Close numerical value (e.g., 50 ft instead of 75 ft).

    3. Confused category (e.g., Class B distance for Class A; heavy extinguisher rule for light). Ensure distractors are realistic
    errors from partial knowledge.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Physical and Facility Security
  Design (Domain: Security Architecture And Engineering; Subdomain: Environmental Controls and Life Safety; Topic: Portable
  Fire Extinguisher Placement). Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Physical and Facility

  Incorporate this full research context: [Insert full completed content from scaffolding layers, objectives, and research:
  Core concepts (definitions), NFPA 10 specs (travel: Class A 75ft, B 50/30ft, etc.; mounting 5ft/3.5ft), best practices (no
  inaccessible areas due to fire/smoke, signage, lighting), cybersecurity links (data center protection, defense-in-depth),
  sources (NFPA 10: nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=10; OSHA
  29 CFR 1910.157)].


  Use these learning objectives [list all 6]. Cover all Bloom''s levels evenly across 50 flashcards (8-10 per level). Integrate
  active learning for context (e.g., inspire discussion/problem-solving).


  Scaffold content across 4 layers [insert scaffolding details]. Ensure completeness: mounting heights, travel distances by
  hazard/class, signage, obstructions.


  Generate flashcards per schema: MCQ (1 correct, 3 distractors via protocol). Vary types: definitions (Layer 1), standards
  (Layer 2), calculations/scenarios (Layer 3), evaluations/designs (Layer 4). Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'',
  ''back'': ''...'', ''blooms_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': 1-4}, ...].


  Prioritize voter consensus: completeness (NFPA details), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression), scaffolding, cross-links to cybersecurity.'
