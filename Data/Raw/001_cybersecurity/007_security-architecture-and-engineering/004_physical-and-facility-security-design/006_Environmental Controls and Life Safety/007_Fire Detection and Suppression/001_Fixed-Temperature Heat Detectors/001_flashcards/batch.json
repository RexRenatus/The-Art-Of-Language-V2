In security architecture, this means ensuring the wiring, communication protocols, and power supplies are robust and free from interference. This is critical because the primary purpose of integration is to ensure timely notification to emergency responders, which depends on uninterrupted signal transmission, since a delayed or lost signal negates the detector's purpose.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors focus on irrelevant aesthetic factors, incorrect connectivity assumptions, or conflate fire detection with network security, missing the core requirement of reliable signal transmission.",
        "analogy": "Integrating a heat detector with a monitoring station is like ensuring a doorbell is properly wired to ring inside your house; the connection must be solid so you hear the ring when someone presses the button."

      ],
      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The fundamental difference lies in their activation criteria: fixed-temperature detectors require the ambient temperature to reach a specific, high threshold (e.g., 57°C). Rate-of-rise detectors, conversely, trigger when the temperature increases by a significant amount within a short period (e.g., 8°C per minute), irrespective of the absolute temperature reached, because they are designed to detect the rapid heat release characteristic of many fires, distinguishing it from slow ambient temperature changes.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly assign specific components, mischaracterize fire type suitability, or reverse the temperature threshold logic, failing to highlight the core distinction in activation triggers.",
        "analogy": "A fixed-temperature detector is like a thermometer that alarms at 'boiling'. A rate-of-rise detector is like a thermometer that alarms if the temperature jumps up 'very quickly', even if it hasn't reached boiling yet."
