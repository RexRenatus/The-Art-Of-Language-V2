active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between Dry Floodproofing and Wet Floodproofing for a coastal
    data center vulnerable to storm surges. How do these methods impact operational continuity for cyber infrastructure, and
    what role do standards like FEMA NFIP play in decision-making?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol:
    rules: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., confusing BFE with DFE); 2)
      Partial truths (e.g., benefits of one method applied to another); 3) Extreme values or unrelated terms (e.g., seismic
      standards in flood context). Ensure distractors are realistic from voter feedback (accuracy in physical security) and
      research (FEMA/ASCE).'
    variety: Mix 40% Q&A, 30% cloze, 30% MCQ. Aim for 50-100 cards total, balanced across scaffolding layers.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for educational content on ''Flood Mitigation and Drainage Design''
  in the domain of Security Architecture and Engineering > Physical and Facility Security Design > Environmental Controls
  and Life Safety > Water and Plumbing Systems. Note: This is physical security for facilities protecting cyber assets (CISSP-aligned),
  NOT core cybersecurity—emphasize accuracy per voter consensus.


  Generate 50-100 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema. Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active learning elements: Draw questions from discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving for engagement.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards evenly (12-13 per layer): Layer 1 Foundation, Layer 2 Components, Layer 3 Implementation,
  Layer 4 Integration.

  - Topic content: Core concepts (Flood Mitigation, Drainage Design, BFE, DFE, SWEL, Resilience); Methods (Dry/Wet Floodproofing,
  Elevation, Barriers); Standards (FEMA NFIP, ASCE 24); Calculations (loads); Integration (facility security resilience).
