        "core_logic": "The Faraday cage effect describes how a conductive enclosure, like a properly designed LPS network surrounding a structure, shields the interior from external electric fields, including those generated by lightning, because charges redistribute on the conductor's surface. This functions by ensuring the electric field inside remains zero.",
