active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a budget-constrained organization housing critical IT infrastructure, should priority be given to
    full NFPA 780-compliant Lightning Protection Systems or enhanced surge protection on data lines? Debate using real-world
    examples of lightning-induced outages (e.g., data center blackouts leading to ransomware exploitation opportunities).
    Consider cybersecurity implications like cascading failures.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    instead of intercept), 1 related but incorrect term (e.g., ''Fuse'' vs. ''SPD''), 1 edge-case reversal (e.g., ''High resistance

  - Learning objectives: [paste full list above].

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards: 15 Layer 1, 15 Layer 2, 10 Layer 3, 10 Layer 4.

  - Active learning: Weave in discussion/problem-solving hooks (e.g., ''Relate to budget debate'').

  - Bloom''s progression: Balance across levels.

  - Research: NFPA 780 (installation std), UFC 3-575-01 (DoD lightning/EMP), grounding/bonding/SPDs, cybersecurity ties (data
  center protection).

  - Sources: NFPA 780, UFC 3-575-01, IEEE Std 142, CISSP Official Guide Domain 3.


  Follow flashcard_schema exactly: 70% MCQ (w/ distractors), 20% Q&A/cloze, 10% scenarios. Output JSON array of objects: {''type'':
