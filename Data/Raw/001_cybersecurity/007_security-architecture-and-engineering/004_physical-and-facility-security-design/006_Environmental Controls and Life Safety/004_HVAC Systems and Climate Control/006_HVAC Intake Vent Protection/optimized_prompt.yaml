  discussion_prompt: 'Debate in groups: ''In the context of IT/OT convergence, is physical protection of HVAC intake vents
    sufficient against hybrid cyber-physical threats, or must it always integrate NIST SP 800-82 cyber controls? Use real-world
    OT incidents like Stuxnet or Colonial Pipeline to support your arguments.'' Encourage critical thinking by requiring evidence
    from standards and reflection on defense-in-depth.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    NIST 800-53/ISO 27001 instead of 800-82); (2) Physical-only focus (e.g., ''energy efficiency'' vs. security); (3) Misprioritization
    (e.g., confidentiality over OT safety). Ensure distractors are realistic from research context.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert cybersecurity educator and flashcard generator specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 25 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''HVAC Intake Vent
  Protection'' (Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Physical and Facility Security Design > Environmental
  Controls and Life Safety > HVAC Systems and Climate Control > HVAC Intake Vent Protection).


  **Context**: Focus on cyber-physical risks (physical tampering enabling OT compromises). Key source: NIST SP 800-82 Rev.
  3 (OT security guide for HVAC/BAS). Distinguish physical (barriers vs. tampering) vs. cyber (network exploits). Real-world:
  Stuxnet/Colonial Pipeline OT attacks. Prior knowledge: Physical security basics, HVAC airflow roles.


  **Incorporate**:

  - Learning objectives: [PASTE THE learning_objectives ARRAY HERE].

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards: 6 Layer1, 6 Layer2, 7 Layer3, 6 Layer4.

  - Bloom''s distribution: 30% Remember/Understand, 40% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate/Create.

  - Active learning tie-in: Include cards mimicking discussion (compare), peer-teach (explain NIST), problem-solving (scenarios).

  - Formative assessments: 10 MCQs (e.g., ''Which standard for OT/HVAC? A) NIST 800-82 (correct), distractors: 800-53/ISO27001/PCI-DSS''),
  5 TF (e.g., ''OT prioritizes safety over confidentiality: True''), 5 ShortAnswer, 5 Scenario.


  **Output exactly**: JSON array of flashcards matching flashcard_schema. Ensure variety, accuracy, clarity on physical-cyber
  distinction, and pedagogical depth. No extra text.'
