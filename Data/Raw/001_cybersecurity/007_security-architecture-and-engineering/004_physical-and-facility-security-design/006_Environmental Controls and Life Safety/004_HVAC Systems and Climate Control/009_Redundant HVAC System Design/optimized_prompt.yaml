  discussion_prompt: 'In a data center, a cyber attack disables the primary HVAC chiller via a BMS vulnerability. Debate the
    pros and cons of implementing N+1 vs. 2N redundancy: How does each balance cost, energy efficiency, and resilience to
    cyber-physical threats? Reference NIST SP 800-82 and real-world cases like HVAC exploits in ICS breaches.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Plausible misconceptions (e.g., confuse N+1 with 2N capacity)
    - Partial truths (e.g., correct for mechanical but wrong for cyber context)
    - Common errors (e.g., ignore BMS segmentation)
    - Opposites/extremes (e.g., 'no redundancy needed' vs. full 2N)
    - Irrelevant details (e.g., non-security HVAC standards)
    quantity: 3 distractors per MCQ, balanced across voter-suggested risks (e.g., cyber-physical, standards compliance)
