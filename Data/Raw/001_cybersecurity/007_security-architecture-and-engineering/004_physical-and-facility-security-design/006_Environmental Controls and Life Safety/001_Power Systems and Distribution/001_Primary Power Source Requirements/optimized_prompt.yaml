active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether utility grid diversity or on-site generation should be prioritized as
    the primary power source for a nuclear power plant's OT systems in an all-hazards scenario (e.g., cyber attack + hurricane).
    Support with NIST SP 800-82 and NERC CIP references, considering trade-offs in cost, resilience, and cybersecurity.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  Primary Power Source Requirements (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture & Engineering > Physical/Facility Security
  Design > Environmental Controls/Life Safety > Power Systems/Distribution > Primary Power Source Requirements).


  Incorporate these EXACT elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full list above]

  - Active Learning: Use for higher-order card inspiration (e.g., scenario-based MCQs from problem-solving).

  - Scaffolding: Balance cards: 10 Layer 1 (foundation/terms), 10 Layer 2 (standards/components), 10 Layer 3 (implementation),
  10 Layer 4 (integration).

  - Prior Knowledge: Link to EE basics (AC/DC, voltage) and risk assessment.

  - Research: Resilient power (withstand/recover disruptions); COOP/BC; All-Hazards; OT/ICS/SCADA; NIST SP 800-82 Rev. 3 (full:
  ICS power redundancy, monitoring, OT security); NERC CIP (cyber asset protection); NFPA 70 (wiring/capacity); Reqts: N+1
  redundancy, utility diversity, capacity sizing, fault monitoring, fuel storage, grid independence.
