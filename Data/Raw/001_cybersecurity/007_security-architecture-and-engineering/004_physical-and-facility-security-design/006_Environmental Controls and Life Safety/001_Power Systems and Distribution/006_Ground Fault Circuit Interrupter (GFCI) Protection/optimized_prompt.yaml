    - apply
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the analogy between GFCI anomaly detection (current imbalance) and cybersecurity IDS/IPS (network
    traffic anomalies). How does rapid tripping in GFCIs mirror automated threat response? Evaluate strengths and limitations
    in a physical security context for data centers.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Physical and Facility Security
  Design (Domain: Security Architecture And Engineering > Physical and Facility Security Design > Environmental Controls and
  Life Safety > Power Systems and Distribution > Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) Protection). Generate 50 high-quality
  flashcards optimized for spaced repetition (Anki-style) covering the full topic hierarchy.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ''learning_objectives'']

  - Scaffolding: Distribute evenly across 4 layers: [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING_LAYERS]. 12-13 cards per layer.

  - Active learning: Weave in prompts (e.g., ''How would you discuss this in a peer teaching?'').

  - Pedagogy: 40% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 30% APPLY/ANALYZE, 30% EVALUATE/CREATE. Use analogies to IDS/IPS.

  - Content accuracy: Ground faults (imbalance to ground), UL 943 (auto-monitor), NEC 210.8 locations (bathrooms/garages/outdoors/construction),
  CIA Availability link.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''bloom_level'': ''...''}} , ...]. Follow flashcard_schema exactly: 30% multiple-choice with distractors, all others Q&A.
  Ensure progressive scaffolding, voter priorities (concept map refs, simulations), and web research (definitions, standards).'
