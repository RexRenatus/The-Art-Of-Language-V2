active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the ethical and cybersecurity implications of prioritizing power to critical infrastructure like
    hospitals versus financial data centers during a cyber-induced load shedding event. Consider NERC CIP standards and potential
    risks of misprioritization.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1 common misconception (e.g., confuse load shedding with black start),
    1 related but incorrect term (e.g., ESP vs. firewall), 1 extreme/overgeneralized (e.g., ''shed all non-essential loads
    immediately without classification''). Ensure distractors test subtle understanding (e.g., impact levels in CIP-003).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² CISSP domains. Topic:
  Load Shedding and Priority Power Management (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Physical
  and Facility Security Design > Environmental Controls and Life Safety > Emergency Power Controls > Load Shedding and Priority
  Power Management). Use this optimized pedagogy:


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list above].

  **Active Learning:** Incorporate elements like discussion ethics, peer teaching components, problem-solving ransomware scenarios.

  **Scaffolding:** Build cards across 4 layers: [Insert full scaffolding above]. Ensure prior knowledge links to environmental
  controls/life safety/emergency power.

  **NERC CIP Details:** CIP-003-9 (full: R1 policy, R2 responsibilities, R3 training, R4 awareness, R5 access, R6 monitoring,
  R7 incident response, R8 recovery, R9 vendor remote; scaled by low/medium/high impact); CIP-005 (ESPs); CIP-007 (system
  security). Best practices: UPS/generators, AI monitoring.
