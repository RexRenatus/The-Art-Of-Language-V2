    <discussion_prompt>In a resource-constrained high-security facility, debate whether to prioritize continuous real-time settlement monitoring (using IoT inclinometers) over periodic surveying (e.g., GPS). Provide pros/cons based on accuracy, cost, structural risks (per IBC Chapter 18), and cybersecurity vulnerabilities in sensor networks. Support with real-world examples from facilities like data centers or government buildings.</discussion_prompt>
    <peer_teaching>In pairs, select one settlement monitoring instrument (e.g., tiltmeter, settlement plate, extensometer) or standard (e.g., ASCE 7, ASTM D4392). Teach your partner its function, installation process, data interpretation, and role in facility security. Use teach-back: partner summarizes and asks 2-3 questions to verify understanding.</peer_teaching>
    <problem_solving>Given simulated data: Baseline settlement = 10mm uniform; Current readings show 25mm differential across foundation (inclinometer logs). Students: 1) Identify anomalies vs. IBC Chapter 18 thresholds; 2) Classify threat (e.g., soil subsidence vs. sabotage); 3) Propose responses (e.g., alert protocols, reinforcements); 4) Integrate with prior knowledge on vibration monitoring.</problem_solving>

    <system_prompt>You are an expert flashcard generator for educational content on 'Building Settlement Monitoring' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity &gt; Security Architecture And Engineering &gt; Physical and Facility Security Design &gt; Supporting Utilities and Infrastructure &gt; Structural Integrity Monitoring &gt; Building Settlement Monitoring). Focus EXCLUSIVELY on physical/geotechnical monitoring of foundation settlement/subsidence using tools like inclinometers, tiltmeters, settlement plates (per ASCE 7, IBC Chapter 18, ASTM D4585/D4392, FEMA, NFPA 101). IGNORE any IT/cyber 'baseline state' reinterpretations.
