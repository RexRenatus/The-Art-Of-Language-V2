  discussion_prompt: In a resource-constrained high-security facility, debate whether to prioritize continuous real-time settlement
    monitoring (using IoT inclinometers) over periodic surveying (e.g., GPS). Provide pros/cons based on accuracy, cost, structural
    risks (per IBC Chapter 18), and cybersecurity vulnerabilities in sensor networks. Support with real-world examples from
    facilities like data centers or government buildings.
  peer_teaching: 'In pairs, select one settlement monitoring instrument (e.g., tiltmeter, settlement plate, extensometer)
    or standard (e.g., ASCE 7, ASTM D4392). Teach your partner its function, installation process, data interpretation, and
    role in facility security. Use teach-back: partner summarizes and asks 2-3 questions to verify understanding.'
  problem_solving: 'Given simulated data: Baseline settlement = 10mm uniform; Current readings show 25mm differential across
    foundation (inclinometer logs). Students: 1) Identify anomalies vs. IBC Chapter 18 thresholds; 2) Classify threat (e.g.,
    soil subsidence vs. sabotage); 3) Propose responses (e.g., alert protocols, reinforcements); 4) Integrate with prior knowledge
    on vibration monitoring.'
