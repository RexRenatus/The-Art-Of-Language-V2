active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how physical structural damage from events like earthquakes or blasts (per
    ASCE 7) could cascade into cybersecurity vulnerabilities in a data center. Reference NIST CSF Recover subfunctions (e.g.,
    RC.RP) and propose mitigation strategies, justifying with evidence from standards like FEMA P-154.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    with Recover); (2) Related but incorrect term (e.g., RTO vs. RPO); (3) Overly simplistic/extreme option (e.g., ''ignore
    safety'' vs. ''isolate area''). Ensure distractors test nuance in physical-cyber integration, standards (FEMA vs. NIST),
    and procedures.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for university-level cybersecurity education, specializing in Security
  Architecture and Engineering. Topic: ''Structural Damage Assessment Procedures'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture
  And Engineering > Physical and Facility Security Design > Supporting Utilities and Infrastructure > Structural Integrity
  Monitoring > Structural Damage Assessment Procedures). Focus on physical facility damage assessment (post-disaster/attack)
  for structures supporting cyber infrastructure, integrating NIST CSF Respond/Recover (complete Recover: addresses aftermath
  via RC.RP recovery planning, RC.IM impact assessment, etc.), NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (PE controls, RA), physical standards
  (FEMA P-154 rapid evaluation, ASCE 7 structural design, NFPA 1600 continuity).
