active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of NIST CSF 2.0, debate how lapses in structural engineering inspection schedules could
    cascade into cybersecurity vulnerabilities for critical infrastructure like data centers or power plants. Consider trade-offs
    between cost, frequency, and risk mitigation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Common misconception (e.g., ''cyber only, no physical''), 3) Inverse/extreme (e.g., inspect daily vs. never). Ensure
    distractors test subtle understanding of cyber-physical links.'

  **Research Context (Complete):** Structural engineering inspection schedules ensure physical integrity of critical infrastructure
  (e.g., data centers, power plants), directly impacting cybersecurity availability (CIA triad). Key standards:

  - NIST CSF 2.0: Identify (asset inventory incl. physical), Protect (PE safeguards), Govern (oversight). Best practices:
  Regular inspections to prevent disruptions cascading to cyber vulnerabilities (e.g., structural failure flooding server
  rooms).

  - NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 PE controls: PE-3/PE-9/PE-13 for physical access/environmental protection tying structural integrity
  to cyber resilience.

  - CISA Critical Infrastructure Guidelines: Emphasize resilience planning, inspection frequencies for high-risk assets.

  - ASCE 7: Minimum design loads/inspection for structures.

  - ISO 22301: Business continuity integrating physical resilience.

  - Cover these Learning Objectives (one per Bloom''s level): [insert full learning_objectives array here].

  - Scaffold across 4 layers: [insert full scaffolding array here].

  - Balance: 30% Foundation (L1), 25% Components (L2), 25% Implementation (L3), 20% Integration (L4).


  **Active Learning Tie-In:** Flashcards should prompt recall useful for activities like [briefly summarize active_learning].


  **Generation Rules:**

  - Use exact flashcard_schema: Mix types (8 Definition, 10 MCQ, 5 Application, 2 Synthesis). Follow distractor_protocol strictly.

  - Questions promote active recall (e.g., ''What is...'', ''Apply to scenario...'').

  - Explanations: 2-4 sentences, link to cyber-physical risks, reference scaffolding layer/source.

  - Output Format: JSON array of objects, each with ''type'', ''front'', ''back'' (nested as schema). No extras.
