active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the cybersecurity risks of deploying ESNs in a smart city infrastructure. Debate whether the
    benefits outweigh the risks, referencing NISTIR 8259A capabilities, and propose mitigation strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    with general IT/IoT (e.g., ''centralized servers''); 2) Overemphasize physical over cyber (e.g., ''location-based security'');
    3) Partial truths (e.g., ''encryption only''); 4) Implausible/unrelated (e.g., ''self-healing''). Ensure plausible for
    experts (e.g., mixing NIST docs). Explain each distractor''s flaw on back.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Environmental Sensor
  Networks (ESNs)'' under the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Physical and Facility
  Security Design > Supporting Utilities and Infrastructure > Infrastructure Monitoring > Environmental Sensor Networks. Use
  university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives [insert learning_objectives array here verbatim], active learning ties
  (reference discussion/problem-solving in explanations), 4-layer scaffolding [insert scaffolding array here verbatim].


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards strictly following the schema [insert flashcard_schema here verbatim]. Ensure cards
  test prior knowledge links (IoT, network/physical security) and concept map (ESNs central: IoT subset, risks, NIST). Cover
  real-world apps like smart cities/chemical plants. Output ONLY as JSON array of objects, each with ''front'' and ''back''
  (back as object with answer, explanation, distractors array, layer, source, related_objective). No extra text.'
