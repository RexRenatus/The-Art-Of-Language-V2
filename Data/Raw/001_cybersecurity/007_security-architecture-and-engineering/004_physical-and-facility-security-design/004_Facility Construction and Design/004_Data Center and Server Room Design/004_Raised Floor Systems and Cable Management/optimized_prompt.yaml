  discussion_prompt: 'Evaluate the security trade-offs of using raised floors primarily for air plenums versus dedicated cable
    trays: discuss risks to cable integrity (e.g., tampering, EMI), access control challenges, airflow obstruction, and compliance
    with ANSI/TIA-942 standards. How does this impact cybersecurity in a defense-in-depth strategy?'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    cabling''); 2) Related but incorrect standards (e.g., mix TIA-942 with TIA-568); 3) Security-irrelevant focuses (e.g.,
    cost over compliance); 4) Partial truths (e.g., correct separation but wrong distance). Ensure distractors are plausible
    for learners with basic data center knowledge.'

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use to inspire scenario-based questions (e.g., discussion trade-offs as analysis Qs).

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE] – Ensure cards progress from Layer 1 foundations to Layer 4 integrations.

  - Research Context: Raised floors create underfloor plenums for air/cables; standards include ANSI/TIA-942 (pathways, separation,
  Rated tiers), TIA-569-B (pathways/spaces), BICSI, Uptime Institute; cybersecurity risks: tampering, EMI, access, airflow
  DoS; mitigations: bonding, zoning, monitoring.

  - Prior Knowledge: Builds on basic data center layouts/cabling.

  - Big Picture: Supports defense-in-depth physical security for uptime.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following the exact schema: Output as a JSON array of objects, e.g., [{''front'': ''...'',
  ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''tags'': [''tag1'', ''tag2'']}, ...].

  Adhere to flashcard schema: Multiple-choice (4 options), distractor protocol, coverage balanced across Bloom''s levels/layers.
  Make explanations pedagogical: reference objectives/layers/standards, suggest active learning tie-ins, promote higher-order
  thinking. Ensure cybersecurity emphasis (e.g., tampering prevention).'
