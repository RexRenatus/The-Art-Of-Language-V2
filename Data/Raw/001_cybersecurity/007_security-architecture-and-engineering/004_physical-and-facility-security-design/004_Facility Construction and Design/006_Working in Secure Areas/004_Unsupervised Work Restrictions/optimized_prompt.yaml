active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a secure facility like a SCIF, debate the trade-offs of strict unsupervised work restrictions (e.g.,
    two-person rule) on productivity versus security. Use real-world examples from DoD or intelligence community guidelines
    to support your position, considering risks like insider threats and compliance costs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., software execution from old
    NIST CM-7), 2) Related but incorrect concept (e.g., visitor badges only, ignoring two-person rule), 3) Overly broad/narrow
    (e.g., ''All areas require supervision'' vs. classified only). Ensure distractors test accuracy and subdomain focus (physical
    vs. logical security).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  Unsupervised Work Restrictions (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Physical and Facility
  Security Design > Facility Construction and Design > Working in Secure Areas > Unsupervised Work Restrictions). Focus EXCLUSIVELY
  on physical security: Policies prohibiting unsupervised work by uncleared personnel in secure areas (e.g., SCIFs) via two-person
  rule/escorts to mitigate tampering/espionage. Reference: ICD 705, NIST SP 800-53 PE-3/PE-6, DoD 5200.01. AVOID software/logical
  controls (no CM-7, SA-7, SC-2).


  Incorporate pedagogy:

  - Bloom''s objectives: [insert learning_objectives array here]

  - Scaffolding: Generate 20-30 flashcards distributed across 4 layers: 5-8 per layer (Layer 1 Foundation first).

  - Active learning: Tie each flashcard back to one activity.


  Use exact flashcard_schema: Front (question + tags), Back (answer, explanation, distractors explained, references, active
  tie). Output as markdown list: **Flashcard 1** \n **Front:** ... \n **Back:** ...


  Ensure accuracy (physical focus), completeness (standards cited), pedagogy (progressive Bloom''s/layers). Prioritize voter
  consensus: Align to ''Working in Secure Areas''.'
