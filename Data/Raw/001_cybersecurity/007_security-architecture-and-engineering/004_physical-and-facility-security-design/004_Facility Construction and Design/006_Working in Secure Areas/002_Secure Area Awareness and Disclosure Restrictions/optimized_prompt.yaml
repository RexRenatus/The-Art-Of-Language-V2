active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the misconception that 'secure areas are only about physical barriers like
    locks and badges, not logical controls or personnel awareness.' Use real-world examples from NIST guidelines to argue
    how disclosure restrictions bridge physical and digital security, and propose solutions for common violations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² CISSP domains. Topic:
  Secure Area Awareness and Disclosure Restrictions (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Physical
  and Facility Security Design > Facility Construction and Design > Working in Secure Areas > Secure Area Awareness and Disclosure
  Restrictions). Use this research context: Secure areas protect CUI/PII via physical/logical controls and disclosure restrictions
  (no unauthorized sharing). Standards: NIST SP 800-53 (PE controls), 800-171 (CUI safeguarding). Sources: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf,
  https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/171/r3/final.


  Incorporate pedagogy: Learning objectives [paste learning_objectives array]; Active learning [paste active_learning]; Scaffolding
  [paste scaffolding_layers]; Prior knowledge: CIA triad, access controls, physical basics.


  Big picture: Foundational for NIST-compliant facility design, bridging physical/digital security (CISSP-relevant).
