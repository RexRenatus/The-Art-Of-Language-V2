active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a secure government facility, debate the pros and cons of using heavy timber (Type IV) versus protected
    steel framing for fire resistance. Consider factors like charring vs. heat expansion, cost, and physical security implications
    (e.g., asset protection during fire). Support with IBC standards.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Common misconceptions (e.g., confuse with light-frame wood).
    - Edge cases (e.g., slightly off dimensions like 7x7in).
    - Related but wrong standards (e.g., NFPA vs. IBC subtypes).
    - Security-irrelevant distractors (e.g., cyber-focused to test accuracy).
    count: Always 3, balanced difficulty
    avoid: Random/irrelevant; ensure plausible for learners
