  Incorporate Research Context: SOAR integrates tools, automates tasks, streamlines responses via orchestration (tool coordination),
  automation (routine tasks), response (incident handling), playbooks (workflows), mitigating alert fatigue and tool sprawl
  (sources: tuxcare.com, startupdefense.io, balbix.com). Aligns with NIST IR lifecycle, CSF Respond, ISO 27001 A.16.1, MITRE
  ATT&CK. Platforms: Splunk SOAR, Cortex XSOAR, IBM QRadar SOAR.


  Learning Objectives (Bloom''s): [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]. Ensure cards progressively hit these.


  Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL LAYERS FROM ABOVE]. Distribute cards: Layer 1 heavy on remember/understand; escalate to
  create.


  Active Learning Context: Use for explanations/tags: Discussion on playbook balance; Peer teaching on concepts; Problem-solving
  on phishing scenarios.


  Big Picture: SOAR enables scalable Operational Security, reducing MTTR, proactive hunting.
