        "core_logic": "Implementing continuous authorization for IoT devices presents unique challenges due to their resource constraints. Many IoT devices have limited processing power, memory, and battery life, making it difficult to run sophisticated, real-time verification protocols or maintain persistent secure connections. This necessitates lightweight protocols and efficient authorization mechanisms, such as those defined in RFC 9770 for constrained environments, to balance security with device capabilities.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly assume IoT devices are exempt from authorization needs, are always centrally managed, or use entirely incompatible protocols, overlooking the specific technical constraints that make continuous authorization implementation challenging for these devices.",
