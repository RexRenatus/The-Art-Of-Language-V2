active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Adopting an Assume Breach mindset requires organizations
    to abandon all perimeter defenses.'' Support your position with examples from NIST CSF and recent breaches like SolarWinds,
    considering trade-offs in cost, complexity, and resilience.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., confuses with perimeter-only defense).'
    - 'Distractor 2: Related but incorrect term (e.g., ''Assume Perimeter'' instead of Assume Breach).'
    - 'Distractor 3: Partial truth/over-simplification (e.g., focuses only on prevention, ignores response).'
    - 'Ensure plausibility: Based on real-world errors from sources like NIST or breach reports.'
    - 'Avoid: Obvious wrongs; aim for 50-70% learner error rate for challenge.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Secure Design Principles
  under Zero Trust Architecture. Topic: ''Assume Breach'' (Level 6 in hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And
  Engineering > Secure Design Principles > Zero Trust Architecture Principles > Zero Trust Core Tenets > Assume Breach). Use
  this research context: Assume Breach is a mindset assuming compromise has occurred, emphasizing detection/response over
  prevention alone; ties to Zero Trust (''never trust, always verify''), resilience, attack surface minimization; aligns with
  NIST CSF (Detect, Respond, Recover).
