active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs between exhaustive security unit testing and agile development timelines. Using
    OWASP WSTG categories (e.g., Input Validation, Authentication), debate which security checks are essential at the unit
    level versus higher integration tests. Consider real-world misconceptions that security testing inevitably slows down
    development.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  ## Security Unit Testing: A Comprehensive Summary

  Security unit testing tests individual code units for security vulnerabilities early in SDLC (shift-left). Core Concepts:
  Unit Testing (smallest parts like functions); Security Unit Testing (vuln detection in units); Vulnerability (exploitable
  weakness); Threat (exploiter); Risk (potential harm).
