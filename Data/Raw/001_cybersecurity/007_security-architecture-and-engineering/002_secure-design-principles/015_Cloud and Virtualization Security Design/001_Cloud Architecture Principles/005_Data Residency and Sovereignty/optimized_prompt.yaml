learning_objectives:
  remember:
  - objective: Define data residency and data sovereignty, including core vocabulary such as geographic location vs. legal
      jurisdiction.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  understand:
  - objective: Explain the key differences between data residency and data sovereignty with real-world examples (e.g., AWS
      regions for residency vs. GDPR applicability for sovereignty).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  create:
  - objective: Design a cloud architecture that ensures data sovereignty compliance for a multinational fintech serving EU
      and U.S. clients, incorporating providers like AWS, Azure, or GCP.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  analyze:
  - objective: Compare how regulations like GDPR, U.S. CLOUD Act, and Schrems II decision affect data sovereignty in multi-jurisdictional
      setups.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  evaluate:
  - objective: Assess compliance risks of storing EU citizen data in a U.S. data center, considering performance trade-offs
      and hybrid solutions.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Identify residency and sovereignty implications in a given cloud deployment scenario, such as selecting regions
      for EU citizen data.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  Data Residency and Sovereignty (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Secure Design Principles
  > Cloud and Virtualization Security Design > Cloud Architecture Principles > Data Residency and Sovereignty). Use the provided
  learning_objectives, active_learning_components, scaffolding_layers, and research context to generate flashcards.


  Big Picture: Essential for designing compliant cloud architectures amid geopolitical tensions (e.g., GDPR vs. CLOUD Act).
  Prerequisites: Cloud models, data classification, GDPR basics.


  Sources: GDPR (eur-lex.europa.eu); CLOUD Act (congress.gov); Schrems II (curia.europa.eu); China''s Cybersecurity Law; India''s
  DPDP Act 2023.


  Incorporate active learning by embedding related prompts in explanations (e.g., ''Relates to discussion on latency vs. compliance'').
  Ensure progression: 30% Layer 1-2 (lower Bloom''s), 40% Layer 3 (apply/analyze), 30% Layer 4 (evaluate/create).


  Output ONLY a valid JSON array of 20-30 flashcards matching the exact flashcard_generation_schema. Use snake_case, proper
  JSON escaping. No markdown, no intro text.


  [Insert full scaffolding_layers content here for reference when generating. Ensure flashcards test definitions, differences,
  regulations (GDPR rights/compliance, CLOUD Act access, Schrems II), implementations (regions, SCCs), integrations (zero-trust,
  multi-cloud).]'
