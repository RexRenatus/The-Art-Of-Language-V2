active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given a fictional startup handling customer health data under resource constraints, debate which ISO
    27001 Annex A controls from the four ISO 27002 themes (Organizational, People, Physical, Technological) should be prioritized
    in the Statement of Applicability (SoA). Justify selections based on risk assessment and CIA Triad impacts. Discuss trade-offs
    between full compliance and practical implementation, addressing misconceptions like treating ISO as a mere checklist.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    with 27002 guidance); 2) Similar term/control (e.g., Physical vs Technological theme); 3) Partial truth (e.g., wrong control
    count). Ensure distractors test nuance without being obvious.'

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (mix 40% recall/understand, 30% apply/analyze, 30% evaluate/create) optimized for Anki/spaced
  repetition. Base content on:

  - Core concepts: ISMS, CIA Triad, SoA, risk assessment/treatment, security controls.

  - ISO 27001: ISMS requirements (clauses 4-10, Annex A: 93 controls).

  - ISO 27002:2022: Organizational (37 controls, e.g., A.5.1 Policies, A.5.19-23 Suppliers/Cloud); People (8, e.g., A.6.1
  Screening); Physical (14, e.g., A.7.2-4 Perimeter); Technological (34, e.g., A.8.1 Endpoints, A.8.28 Coding).

  - Scaffolding: Layer 1 Foundation (terms/CIA); Layer 2 Components (themes/structure); Layer 3 Implementation (SoA steps);
  Layer 4 Integration (NIST/CIS/cloud).
