active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the effectiveness of overwriting (Clear) vs. physical destruction (Destroy) for different media
    types (e.g., HDD vs. SSD) in preventing data recovery, considering cost, time, NIST SP 800-88 guidelines, and real-world
    breach examples. Which method would you prioritize for high-confidentiality data and why? Address common misconceptions
    like 'deleting files is sufficient'.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Deleting files sanitizes data' as distractor for Clear method).
    - Draw from related but incorrect concepts (e.g., confuse Rev. 1 detailed techniques with Rev. 2 program focus).
    - 'Vary difficulty: 1 easy (obvious wrong), 1 medium (partial truth), 1 hard (edge case like SSD vs. HDD).'
    - Ensure 25-33% distractors per Bloom's level to match objectives.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Secure Data Disposal (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Secure Design Principles > Data Protection Design > Data
  Lifecycle Security > Secure Data Disposal). Use the following to generate 30 high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized flashcards:


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full learning_objectives array here]


  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Incorporate prompts from [discussion_prompt], [peer_teaching_activity], [problem_solving_exercise]
  into explanations.


  **Scaffolding:** Distribute cards across 4 layers: [Insert full scaffolding_layers here].


  **Content Sources:** NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1 (techniques: Clear/Purge/Destroy) & Rev. 2 (Draft: programs, validation, logical
  sanitization). Definitions: Media sanitization, irretrievability. Methods: Clear (overwrite), Purge (degauss/encrypt), Destroy
  (physical). Media: HDD/SSD. Compliance: GDPR. Breaches: Discarded drives. Sources: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-88r1.pdf,
  https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/88/r2/draft.


  **Schema:** Follow [flashcard_schema] exactly. 10 basic_recall, 10 mcq (with distractors), 10 comparison. Balance Bloom''s
  levels (5 lower: remember/understand; 15 mid: apply/analyze; 10 higher: evaluate/create). Ensure active recall, no hints
  on front.


  Output ONLY a valid JSON array of 30 flashcards matching the schema.'
