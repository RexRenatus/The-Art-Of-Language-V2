active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate why data in processing is often overlooked as a 'blind spot' in traditional
    security (e.g., compared to disk encryption for data at rest). Reference NIST CSF and propose how confidential computing
    addresses this. Synthesize key insights as a group mind map.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Data in Processing Protection''
  (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Secure Design Principles > Data Protection Design >
  Data State Protection > Data in Processing Protection). Use the provided learning objectives (spanning Bloom''s Taxonomy),
  active learning components, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema to create optimized, spaced-repetition-friendly flashcards.


  Incorporate:

  - Voter consensus: Completeness (NIST SP 1800-28 series on mobile security with data-in-use encryption via enclaves; techniques:
  Intel TME/TDX, AMD SEV, SGX, ARM TrustZone, confidential computing, homomorphic encryption, process isolation, Spectre/Meltdown
  mitigations; cloud examples); pedagogy (Bloom''s progression, prior knowledge links to data at rest/transit); big picture
  (data lifecycle blind spot, zero-trust integration).

  - Research: Data in processing (RAM/CPU, CIA triad); NIST CSF Protect function.


  Generate 75 flashcards in JSON array format: [{''id'':1, ''front'':''...'', ''back'':{''answer'':''...'', ''explanation'':''...'',
  ''metadata'':{...}, ''active_learning_hook'':''...''}}, ...]. Balance: Bloom''s levels/layers per schema. Ensure distractors
  are educational. Output ONLY the JSON array.'
