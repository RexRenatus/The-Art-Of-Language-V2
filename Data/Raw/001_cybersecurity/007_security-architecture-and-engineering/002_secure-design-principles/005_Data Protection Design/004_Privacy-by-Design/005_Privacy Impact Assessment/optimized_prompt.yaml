active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In groups, debate whether a new smart home device collecting voice data requires a full PIA. Identify
    potential privacy risks (e.g., sensitive information like health discussions), compare with non-examples like anonymous
    analytics, and propose mitigations using the NIST Privacy Framework. Address common misconceptions such as PIAs being
    only a regulatory checkbox.
  peer_teaching: Students pair up; one explains PIA steps and Privacy-by-Design using a partner-sharing app example (linking
    to prior knowledge of basic risk assessment and personal data concepts), then switch for teach-back on ERM integration.
    This clarifies confusion between privacy and security.
  problem_solving: Teams conduct a mock PIA for a real-world scenario, e.g., a fitness app sharing data with insurers. Identify
    risks, assess impacts, recommend controls, and role-play a stakeholder review meeting. Analyze case studies like the Equifax
    breach for what a PIA could have prevented. Conclude with think-pair-share on non-examples (e.g., non-personal data projects).

  Generate 40 high-quality flashcards (10 per scaffolding layer) optimized for university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (use
  provided objectives), active learning (reference activities), scaffolding (Layer 1-4), and spaced repetition best practices.
  Incorporate research context: PIA as systematic process for privacy impacts; core concepts (personal/sensitive info, privacy
  risk, PbD, ERM); standards (NIST Privacy Framework: Govern/Identify/Control/Communicate/Map; full OAIC Guide steps: 1. Describe
  project, 2. Map info flows, 3. Identify privacy issues, 4. Consult stakeholders, 5. Evaluate risks/impacts, 6. Recommend
  mitigations, 7. Plan/report; templates/examples). Sources: NISTIR 8432 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2020/NIST.IR.8432.pdf),

  ISO 29134, GDPR Art. 35 DPIA.


  Include: Concept map (PIA central: Inputs>Process>Outputs; links PbD/ERM); misconceptions (PIA≠checkbox; privacy core to
  design); prior links (risk mgmt, personal data); voter activities/examples.
