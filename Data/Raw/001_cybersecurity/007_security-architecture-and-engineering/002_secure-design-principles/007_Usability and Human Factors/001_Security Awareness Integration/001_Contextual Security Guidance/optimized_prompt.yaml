active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the common misconception that Zero Trust means 'no access at all' versus its true emphasis on
    continuous verification. Use real-world examples like remote work breaches to argue how contextual factors (e.g., device
    health, user behavior) influence access decisions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Non-example/extreme (e.g., ''Static perimeter defense''), 3) Unrelated but security-adjacent (e.g., ''Firewall only'').
    Ensure all options grammatically similar, plausible in context, but only one correct. Balance across Bloom levels and
    scaffolding layers.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for university-level cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom''s
  Taxonomy, active learning, and scaffolding. Generate 24 high-quality MCQ flashcards (4 per Bloom level: Remember, Understand,
  Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create) on the topic ''Contextual Security Guidance'' (Category: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture
  And Engineering > Secure Design Principles > Usability and Human Factors > Security Awareness Integration > Contextual Security
  Guidance). Ensure even coverage across 4 scaffolding layers (use provided descriptions).


  Incorporate:

  - Research: Contextual security guidance tailors security to environment/threats (NIST). Core: ZTA (no implicit trust, continuous
  verification; NIST SP 800-207: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/207/final), Risk-Based Approach, Continuous Verification,
  Least Privilege (NIST SP 1800-35: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1800-35.pdf). NIST CSF 2.0
  Govern. Misconceptions: ZTA as ''no access'' (vs. verified); static vs. dynamic.

  - Prerequisites: RBAC/ABAC, perimeter security, risk basics.

  - Big Picture: Adaptive security for cloud/remote work.

  - Concept Map: Contextual Security Guidance → ZTA → Risk-Based → Continuous Verification → Least Privilege.

  - Learning Objectives: [insert the 6 objectives above].

  - Active Learning: Inspire cards from discussion (misconceptions), peer teaching (concept map), problem-solving (scenarios).

  - Scaffolding: [insert the 4 layers above].


  Strictly follow flashcard_schema: MCQ with EXACTLY 4 options (1 correct, 3 distractors per protocol). Questions span objectives/Bloom
  levels. Output ONLY a JSON array of 24 flashcards, each as {"front": "...", "back": {...}} per schema. Do NOT change topic
  hierarchy. Ensure measurable, active verbs, sources/links valid.'
