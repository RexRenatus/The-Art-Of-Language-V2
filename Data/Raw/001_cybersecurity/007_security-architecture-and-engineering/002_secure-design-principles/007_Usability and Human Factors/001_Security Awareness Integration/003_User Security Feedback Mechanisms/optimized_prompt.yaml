active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the balance between transparency in security feedback (e.g., explaining
    'why' an authentication failed) and operational security risks. Reference NIST SP 800-63 usability guidelines and provide
    examples of effective vs. ineffective feedback.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Topic Hierarchy:** Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Secure Design Principles > Usability and Human
  Factors > Security Awareness Integration > User Security Feedback Mechanisms.


  **Completed Research Context:**

  User Security Feedback Mechanisms inform users on security events/threats to boost awareness and secure behavior.


  Core Concepts:

  - Security Feedback: Info on events/vulnerabilities/controls.

  - User Awareness: Threat/policy knowledge.

  - Secure Behavior: Policy-aligned actions.

  - Incident Response: Breach management.


  NIST SP 800-63-4 Series (Digital Identity Guidelines):

  - SP 800-63-4: General (csrc.nist.gov/pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63-4.html).

  - 800-63A-4: Enrollment/Proofing (feedback on proofing failures).

  - 800-63B-4: Authenticators (error messages, recovery).

  - 800-63C-4: Federation (assertion feedback).

  Usability: Plain language, clear errors, actionable steps, no unnecessary alarms/jargon.


  Redress Mechanisms (SP 800-63-4 §5.3): Processes for challenging decisions (enrollment denial, suspension). Includes: authenticator
  recovery (backups/codes), appeals (evidence submission), support escalation, timely resolution (e.g., 3-5 days). Builds
  user trust.


  Examples: Effective (''Use recovery code or contact support''); Ineffective (''Error 403: Forbidden'').

  **Active Learning Inspiration:** Generate cards that prep for discussions (e.g., trade-offs), peer teaching (e.g., explain
  components), problem-solving (scenarios).


  **Task:** Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards per the exact FLASHCARD_SCHEMA above. Distribute: 25% Layer 1 (Remember/Understand),
  25% Layer 2 (Understand/Analyze), 25% Layer 3 (Apply/Analyze), 25% Layer 4 (Evaluate/Create). Ensure variety (MCQ 80%, cloze
  20%), active recall, no hints in questions. Output ONLY the JSON array, no extra text.'
