  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the trade-offs: Should security designers prioritize zero cognitive load or maximum protection?
    Analyze real cases like password fatigue leading to breaches (e.g., shadow IT) versus simplified biometrics. Use think-pair-share:
    Individually note pros/cons, pair to debate, share with class to challenge misconceptions that ''security must be inconvenient.'''
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Cognitive load only from complex
    passwords'' ignoring extraneous design); 2) Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Minimize all load types equally''
    vs. manage intrinsic); 3) Plausible opposite/extreme (e.g., ''Increase load for better security'' vs. balance). Ensure
    distractors are realistic, derived from voter-noted misconceptions or research (e.g., ''security must be inconvenient'').'

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (10 per Bloom''s pair: Remember/Understand, Apply/Analyze, Evaluate/Create; 5 per scaffolding
  layer). Cover all objectives, layers, frameworks (NIST, ISO, SABSA), voter priorities (trade-offs, examples like password
  fatigue/VPN).


  Use exact Flashcard Schema: [insert full schema above]. Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...''},
  ...]. Ensure university pedagogy: Active recall, spaced repetition-friendly, distractors promote critical thinking. No fluff;
  precise, assessable.'
