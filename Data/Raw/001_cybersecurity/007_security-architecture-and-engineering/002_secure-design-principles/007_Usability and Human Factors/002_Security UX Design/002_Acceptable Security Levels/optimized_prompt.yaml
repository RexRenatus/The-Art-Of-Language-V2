  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the following: ''Is there a universal "acceptable security level," or
    does it vary by industry (e.g., banking apps requiring multi-factor authentication vs. consumer IoT devices prioritizing
    usability)? Support your view with examples of risk tolerance and trade-offs, referencing NIST definitions of assets and
    unacceptable consequences. Identify and challenge common misconceptions like confusing risk tolerance with zero risk.'''
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Related but incorrect terms (e.g., risk appetite vs. tolerance), 3) Extreme examples (e.g., over-secure ignoring usability),
    4) Out-of-context frameworks (e.g., NIST CSF Detect for foundation). Ensure plausibility for active recall testing.'
