active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what ways do secure coding guidelines impact developer experience and usability? Debate the balance
    between security rigor (e.g., strict input validation rules from OWASP) and developer productivity, considering human
    factors like cognitive load and tool integration. Use real-world examples to argue whether security practices enhance
    or hinder usability.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate plausible distractors based on common misconceptions: 1) Confuse similar concepts (e.g.,
    input validation vs. output encoding); 2) Use partial truths (e.g., ''Sanitize all inputs'' instead of ''Validate expected
    format''); 3) Include real vulns from CWE Top 25 (e.g., session fixation as auth issue); 4) Developer pitfalls (e.g.,
    ''Trust client-side validation''). Ensure 1-2 are highly plausible to force analysis.'

  **Research Context (Expanded):** Secure coding guidelines prevent vulnerabilities in SDLC. Core concepts: Secure coding
  (resistant code); Vulnerabilities (e.g., CWE Top 25); SDLC (security per phase); Threat modeling (identify threats); Input
  validation (verify data format/type/range vs. injection); Output encoding (transform data, e.g., HTML escape vs. XSS); Authentication
  (verify identity); Authorization (permissions); Session management (create/maintain/terminate securely vs. hijacking). Standards:
  OWASP (input rules, ESAPI); CERT (language-specific); NIST SP 800-53; MISRA (C/C++). Examples: Insecure SQL: ''SELECT *
  FROM users WHERE id='' + userInput; Secure: PreparedStatement. Sources: owasp.org, cert.org, cwe.mitre.org, nist.gov, misra.org.uk.
