active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In an era of sophisticated ransomware, debate whether the traditional 3-2-1 backup strategy is still
    adequate. Compare/contrast it with immutable and air-gapped backups, considering trade-offs in cost, recovery speed, and
    security effectiveness. Address common misconceptions about backup invulnerability.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Big Picture: Ensures CIA Availability, ransomware resilience, NIST CSF Recover function.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards progressively: 6 Layer 1 (REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND), 6 Layer 2 (UNDERSTAND/APPLY), 7 Layer
  3 (APPLY/ANALYZE), 6 Layer 4 (EVALUATE/CREATE). Vary types (10 MCQ, 10 Q&A, 5 Cloze). Use distractors per protocol. Tie
  explanations to sources, concept map, and activities.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''hints'': ''...''}, ''mcq_options'': [''A'', ''B'',
