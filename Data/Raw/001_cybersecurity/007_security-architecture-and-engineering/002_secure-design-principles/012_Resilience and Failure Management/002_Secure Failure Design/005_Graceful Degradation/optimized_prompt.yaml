active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the trade-offs in a hospital system under cyber attack: should elective surgery scheduling be
    degraded before patient monitoring? Justify using NIST cyber resiliency objectives (Anticipate, Withstand, Recover, Adapt).
    Consider impacts on trust, operational integrity, and patient safety.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    1. Common misconception (e.g., ''Complete shutdown'' instead of reduced function).

    2. Partial truth/confusion (e.g., mix with ''fail-safe'' or redundancy).

    3. Extreme/opposite (e.g., ''Full redundancy without degradation'').

    Ensure distractors are plausible, drawn from related concepts (e.g., NIST goals, SoS failures), and avoid obvious errors.
    Explain why each is wrong in the ''explanation'' field.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university-style pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality, optimized flashcards for the topic ''Graceful
  Degradation'' in Cybersecurity (Domain: Security Architecture And Engineering > Secure Design Principles > Resilience and
  Failure Management > Secure Failure Design).


  **Topic Hierarchy:** Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Secure Design Principles > Resilience and Failure
  Management > Secure Failure Design > Graceful Degradation.


  **Core Content (Incorporate Fully):** Use the provided definitions, NIST references, and scaffolding layers below. Ensure
  all flashcards reference sources like NIST SP 800-160 Vol. 2.


  **Learning Objectives (Cover Across Flashcards):** [Insert full learning_objectives JSON here]


  **Active Learning Integration:** Draw scenarios from discussion (hospital debate), peer teaching (NIST examples/analogies),
  problem-solving (financial SoS plan).


  **Scaffolding Layers (Tag Each Card):** [Insert full scaffolding_layers JSON here]


  **Flashcard Generation Rules:**

  - Generate 25-35 flashcards spanning all objectives, layers, and Bloom''s levels.

  - Strictly follow the flashcard_schema structure and distractor_protocol.

  - Promote active recall: Questions should require reasoning, not rote.

  - Pedagogy: Include assessment hints (e.g., ''Apply to scenario quiz'').

  - Voter Consensus: 100% approval on pedagogy/completeness; emphasize measurable outcomes.


  Output ONLY a valid JSON array of flashcards, no additional text.'
