  - Learning Objectives: [paste the learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: [paste active_learning_components]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste scaffolding_layers]

  - Research Context: Kerckhoffs''s Principle: Security from key secrecy only (Wikipedia). Shannon''s Maxim: Assume full adversary
  knowledge. Vs. Obscurity (fragile). Examples: AES, OpenSSL. Failures: Enigma, DVD CSS, Sony BMG. Standards: CISSP (Domain
  3), NIST SP 800-57, OWASP Secure Design. Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle, https://deviq.com/laws/kerckhoffs-principle,
