  discussion_prompt: 'In a zero-trust architecture, debate the trade-offs of SSO: Does the convenience of reduced credential
    fatigue outweigh risks like IdP compromise as a single point of failure? Provide evidence from standards (SAML/OAuth/OIDC)
    and real-world breaches (e.g., Okta incidents). Groups of 3-4 students, 15 minutes, followed by class synthesis.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL active_learning OBJECT HERE]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL scaffolding_layers ARRAY HERE]


  Generate 45 high-quality flashcards following the exact FLASHCARD_SCHEMA:

  - Mix types: 15 Q&A Basic, 15 MCQ, 10 Diagram/Apply, 5 Analyze/Evaluate.

  - Ensure progressive coverage: Layers 1-2 early cards, building to 3-4.

  - Incorporate voter priorities: Full SAML 2.0 (assertions/bindings), OIDC (ID Token/claims/nonce/flows vs. OAuth), risks
  (single point failure/token theft), best practices (MFA/short-lived tokens).

  - Prior knowledge: Assume basics like auth/session mgmt.

  - Big picture: Zero-trust, compliance.
