active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the most critical attack vector in modern cloud environments (e.g., API
    vulnerabilities vs. phishing). Use MITRE ATT&CK to justify your position and link to CIA triad impacts. What prior knowledge
    of threats and vulnerabilities supports your argument?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., confuse attack
    vector with vulnerability), 2) Related but incorrect terms (e.g., ''threat actor'' instead of ''threat source''), 3) Partial
    truths (e.g., MITRE tactic name but wrong technique), 4) Prior knowledge traps (e.g., CIA elements misused). Ensure distractors
    are realistic from research context.'

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste full list from above]

  - Prior Knowledge: CIA triad, threats, vulnerabilities.

  - Research Context: Definitions (attack vector, threat source, etc.); MITRE ATT&CK (https://attack.mitre.org/ - tactics/techniques
  like T1566 Phishing, T1190 SQLi); NIST SP 800-30 Rev1 (https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-30/rev-1/final -
  threat assessment process); NIST SP 800-53 Rev5 (https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final - controls
  like AC-2, SI-4).
