active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: When responding to a suspected account compromise during an incident, debate whether immediate disablement
    or monitored investigation is preferable, considering legal (e.g., evidence preservation), operational (e.g., business
    continuity), and security risks (e.g., lateral movement). Support arguments with references to NIST SP 800-61 or real-world
    cases like the SolarWinds supply chain attack.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    with similar terms (e.g., lockout as permanent), (2) Misapply standards (e.g., NIST SP 800-63B as only for authentication),
    (3) Real-world errors (e.g., delay disablement for investigation). Ensure distractors are realistic, drawn from research
    context, and teach why they''re incorrect.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security Architecture and

  **Prior Knowledge Anchor:** Basic authentication (e.g., passwords, MFA), access control (NIST AC-2), user provisioning/deprovisioning.


  **Completed Research Context:**

  Account disablement renders a user account inactive to prevent access post-compromise or policy violation. Key distinctions:
  Lockout (temporary, failed logins), Suspension (temporary, e.g., HR), Revocation (permanent credential invalidation). NIST
  SP 800-53 Rev 5 (AC-2: Manage accounts, disable after 35 days inactivity or compromise; AC-7: Lockout after 5 fails). NIST
  SP 800-63B (5.2: Revoke authenticators on suspicion; monitor for anomalies). NIST SP 800-61 Rev 2 (Containment: Isolate/disable
  compromised accounts swiftly). Best practices: Automate via SIEM/IAM (e.g., Disable-ADAccount), log actions, notify stakeholders,
  verify no backdoors. Real-world: SolarWinds (2020) - Rapid disablement of admin accounts limited lateral movement; Colonial
  Pipeline (2021) - Delayed disablement enabled ransomware spread.
