active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the most critical elements to include in incident documentation (e.g., IoCs vs. TTPs vs. impact
    assessment) and prioritize them for a resource-constrained incident response team. Use NIST CSF Respond and Recover functions
    as a reference to justify your prioritization.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 1 common misconception (e.g., confuse IoC with TTP).

    - 1 related but incorrect term (e.g., ''event'' instead of ''incident'').

    - 1 extreme/overly broad option (e.g., ''all network logs'' vs. specific IoCs).

    Ensure distractors are realistic based on NIST definitions and voter suggestions.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Incident Documentation\
  \ (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information Systems Security Capabilities >\
