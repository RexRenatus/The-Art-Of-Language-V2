active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs of implementing 24/7 security monitoring in a small vs. large organization. Using
    NIST SP 800-137, debate whether full automation, hybrid human-AI, or 24/7 staffing is most effective for maintaining security
    posture, considering cost, false positives, and response time. This sparks critical thinking on real-world constraints
    and misconceptions about 'always-on' meaning non-stop human vigilance.
  peer_teaching: Students pair up; one explains the six steps of ISCM (Define strategy, Establish program, Implement, Analyze/Report,
    Respond, Review/Update) using a real-world example like a ransomware attack detection. Partner teaches back and quizzes.
    Addresses misconceptions by reinforcing process over tools.
  problem_solving: 'Provide sample network logs with anomalies (e.g., unusual login patterns). In small groups, students classify
    threats, prioritize alerts using RMF ''Monitor'' step, and propose responses. Real-world application: Mimics SOC triage,
    enhancing practical skills.'

    NIST steps), 2) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''24/7 means only human staffing''), 3) Confusable terms (e.g., ISCM vs.
    periodic vulnerability scanning). Ensure one distractor is the most tempting error.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on
  ''24/7 Security Monitoring'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information Systems
  Security Capabilities > Security Operations > Security Operations Center (SOC) > 24/7 Security Monitoring). Base content
  on NIST SP 800-137 ISCM six-step process (1. Define ISCM Strategy, 2. Establish ISCM Program, 3. Implement ISCM Program,
  4. Analyze/Report ISCM Findings, 5. Respond to ISCM Findings, 6. Review and Update ISCM Program), RMF ''Monitor'' step,
  ISCM, Security Status Monitoring, OA. Sources: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/137/a/final, https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/legacy/sp/nistspecialpublication800-137.pdf,

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [REMEMBER: Define... CREATE: Design...] (distribute flashcards across levels).

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to discussion (trade-offs), peer teaching (six steps), problem-solving (logs).

  - Scaffolding: Balance across 4 layers (Foundation: defs; Components: frameworks; Implementation: steps/tools; Integration:
  advanced).


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: Output ONLY a JSON array of 50 flashcards, each with ''question'', ''answer'', ''type'',
  ''bloom_level'', ''scaffolding_layer'', ''explanation'', ''distractors''. Ensure variety: 40% basic/cloze, 60% MC. Spaced
  repetition friendly: progressive difficulty. Active recall focus. No duplicates.'
