  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether prioritizing Zero Trust tools (per NIST SP 800-207) over legacy perimeter
    defenses better mitigates insider threats in hybrid work environments. Support your position with real-world examples
    (e.g., SolarWinds breach) and reference NIST CSF outcomes.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Research Context (Complete Summary):** Security Tool Deployment: Process of installing, configuring, integrating, managing
  tools (SIEM, EDR, firewalls) for threat detection/prevention/response/recovery. 7 Components: Selection (risk-aligned choice),
  Installation, Configuration, Integration, Testing/Validation, Monitoring/Maintenance, Decommissioning (iterative). Standards:
  NIST CSF 2.0 (6 functions: Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover); NIST SP 800-207 (Zero Trust); NIST SP 1800-35
  Series (practice guides, e.g., Vol A: SIEM for Microsoft 365 credential detection; Vol B: EDR deployment; emphasizes PoC,
  integration testing). Best practices: Automation, least privilege, hybrid env support. Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework),
  SP 800-207 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf), SP 1800-35 (https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/publication/1800-35).
