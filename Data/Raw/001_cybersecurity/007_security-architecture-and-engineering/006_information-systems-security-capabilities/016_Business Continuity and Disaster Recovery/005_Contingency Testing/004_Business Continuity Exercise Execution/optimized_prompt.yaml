active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In small groups, discuss the pros and cons of tabletop exercises versus full-scale exercises for testing
    business continuity plans in a cybersecurity context. Consider factors like cost, resource requirements, and realism based
    on NIST SP 800-84. Share how BIA influences exercise selection.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
