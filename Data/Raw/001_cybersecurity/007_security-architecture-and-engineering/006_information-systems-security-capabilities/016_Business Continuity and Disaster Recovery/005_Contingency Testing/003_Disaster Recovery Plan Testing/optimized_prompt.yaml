learning_objectives:
  remember:
  - objective: Define key terms including Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan, Recovery Time Objective (RTO), Recovery Point Objective
      (RPO), and types of DR testing (walkthrough, tabletop, parallel, full interruption).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  understand:
  - objective: Explain the role of DR plan testing in enhancing cybersecurity resilience and its relationship to Business
      Continuity Planning (BCP).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  create:
  - objective: Design a customized DR testing exercise for a given organizational scenario, incorporating metrics aligned
      with RTO/RPO and NIST SP 800-84 guidelines.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  analyze:
  - objective: Compare and contrast DR testing methods (e.g., parallel vs. full interruption testing) in terms of disruption
      level, cost, and validation effectiveness.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  evaluate:
  - objective: Critique a sample DR plan against NIST SP 800-34 criteria, identifying gaps in testing, training, and exercises
      (TT&E).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Outline the steps to conduct a tabletop DR test, including preparation, execution, and initial evaluation.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  Disaster Recovery Plan Testing (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information Systems Security
  Capabilities > Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery > Contingency Testing > Disaster Recovery Plan Testing). Use the
  provided learning_objectives, active_learning_components, scaffolding_layers (4 layers with prior knowledge/big picture),
  and flashcard_generation_schema to create optimized Anki-style flashcards.


  Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom''s progression, active learning hints, scaffolding from foundation to integration.
  Ground in research: NIST SP 800-34 (7-step process, TT&E), NIST SP 800-84 (testing types: walkthrough/tabletop/parallel/full
  interruption, metrics), RTO/RPO, resilience context. Address misconceptions via distractors.


  Output a JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"front": "Question", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "references":
  ["..."], "active_learning_link": "..."}, "type": "MCQ|Cloze|Basic", "tags": ["layer-X", "bloom-level", "key-term"]}. Ensure
  40-60 cards, balanced coverage, high-quality distractors. Prioritize measurable objectives and real-world application.'
