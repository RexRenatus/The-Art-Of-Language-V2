active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs of implementing geo-redundant datacenters (per GSMA FS.31 ARCH-002) versus cost-optimized
    redundancy in a mid-sized telecom provider. Debate using real-world examples like the 2024 AT&T outage or major DDoS attacks,
    and standards like NIST SP 800-160. What factors (e.g., RTO/RPO, risk) tip the balance toward over- or under-provisioning
    redundancy? Consider budget, scalability, and cyber resiliency.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
