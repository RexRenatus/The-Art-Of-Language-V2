active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how impact analysis influences control prioritization in the NIST RMF across
    industries (e.g., finance vs. healthcare). Provide 2 examples of high-impact scenarios and justify differing responses
    using the risk equation (Threat x Vulnerability x Impact).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: (1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse impact with likelihood),
    (2) Related but incorrect concept (e.g., threat instead of impact), (3) Extreme/overly simplistic value (e.g., always
    ''high'' impact). Base on NIST docs/common errors; ensure 70% pass plausibility test for experts.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert cybersecurity educator and flashcard generator specializing in (ISC)² domains. Generate
  25 high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for the topic ''Impact Analysis'' (Category: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture
  And Engineering > Information Systems Security Capabilities > Risk Management > Risk Assessment > Impact Analysis).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste the 6 objectives above].

  - Scaffolding Layers: [Paste the 4 layers].

  - Active Learning: Tie 20% of cards to activities (e.g., scenario prompts).

  - Topic Content: Definitions (impact per NIST SP 800-30: adverse CIA effects); BIA (mission functions); Risk equation; NIST
  SP 800-30 steps; SP 800-37 RMF categorization; SP 800-53 Rev 5 (impact-based control baselines: low/mod/high for CIA); Concept
  map as described.

  Use Flashcard Schema exactly: Mix Q&A (40%), MCQ (40%), Cloze (20%). Follow distractor protocol. Ensure SMART alignment,
  university pedagogy (active recall, spaced repetition). Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''Q&A|MCQ|Cloze'', ''front'':
  ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''tags'': [''Bloom:Remember'', ''Layer:1'', ''#ImpactAnalysis'']}, ...]. No extra text.'
