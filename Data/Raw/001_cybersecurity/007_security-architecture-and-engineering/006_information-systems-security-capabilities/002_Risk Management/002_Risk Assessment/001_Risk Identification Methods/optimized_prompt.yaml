active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of qualitative methods (e.g., brainstorming, Delphi technique)
    versus quantitative tools (e.g., vulnerability scanners) for risk identification in high-stakes environments like financial
    institutions. Reference NIST SP 800-30 and provide evidence-based arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1. Common misconception (e.g., confuse threat with vulnerability),
    2. Related but incorrect term (e.g., ''mitigation'' instead of ''identification''), 3. Extreme/overly specific example
    from NIST but misapplied. Ensure distractors are realistic, drawn from research context or voter suggestions, and teachable
    moments in explanations.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  Risk Identification Methods (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information Systems Security
  Capabilities > Risk Management > Risk Assessment > Risk Identification Methods). Use the provided learning objectives, active
  learning ideas, 4 scaffolding layers, and flashcard schema to generate 25 high-quality flashcards.


  Incorporate:

  - NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2 (RMF), SP 800-30 (Risk Assessments), CSF ID function.

  - Key methods: Asset Identification, Threat Identification (STRIDE), Vulnerability Analysis, Brainstorming, Checklists,
  Interviews, Delphi Technique, Scenario Analysis, Attack Trees, SWOT, PASTA.

  - Sources: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/37/r2/final, https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/30/r1/final.


  Scaffold content progressively per layers. Align flashcards to Bloom''s levels (tag each). Use active learning for scenario
  prompts.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcards, each as: {"type": "MCQ/Definition/etc.", "front": "...", "back": {"answer": "...",
  "explanation": "...", "bloom_level": "...", "layer": 1-4, "source": "NIST SP 800-30"}}. Ensure distractors follow protocol:
  plausible, misconception-based. Make engaging, precise, and educational for university-level learners.'
