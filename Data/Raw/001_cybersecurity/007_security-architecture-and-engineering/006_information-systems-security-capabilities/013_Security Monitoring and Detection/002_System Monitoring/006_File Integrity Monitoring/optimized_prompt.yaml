active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a zero-trust architecture, how does FIM contribute to continuous monitoring and risk management? Discuss
    potential challenges like handling false positives and share examples from real-world breaches where FIM could have mitigated
    damage.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in File Integrity Monitoring\
  \ (FIM) under the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information Systems Security\
  \ Capabilities > Security Monitoring and Detection > System Monitoring > File Integrity Monitoring.\n\nGenerate 30 high-quality\
  \ flashcards (10 per Bloom's level: Remember/Understand, Apply/Analyze, Evaluate/Create) optimized for spaced repetition\
  \ and active recall. Cover all learning objectives, active learning activities, and 4-layer scaffolding. Prioritize voter\
  \ consensus: Link to CIA Triad integrity, tools (Tripwire, OSSEC), PCI DSS Req 11.5 (quarterly file integrity checks for\
  \ cardholder data), NIST SP 800-137 (ISCM), benefits/limitations, zero-trust integration, false positives handling.\n\n\
  Prior knowledge: Builds on file systems, basic security monitoring.\nBig picture: FIM enables continuous monitoring in zero-trust,\
  \ detects breaches via unauthorized changes to critical files/configs.\nSources: pcisecuritystandards.org (PCI DSS), nist.gov\
