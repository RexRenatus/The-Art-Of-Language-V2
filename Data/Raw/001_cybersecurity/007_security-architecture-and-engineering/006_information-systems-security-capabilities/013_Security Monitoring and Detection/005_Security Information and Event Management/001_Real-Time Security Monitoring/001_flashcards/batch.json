        "core_logic": "The SA family ensures security and privacy are considered from the outset of acquiring or developing systems, because integrating these requirements early prevents costly retrofits and reduces inherent risks throughout the lifecycle.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors represent related but distinct control families: Contingency Planning (recovery), Physical Protection (facilities), and 013_Supply Chain 002_Risk Management (a component of SA), failing to capture the broad acquisition scope.",
        "analogy": "The SA family is like the architectural and engineering phase of building a house – it ensures that security features like strong foundations and secure locks are planned and built-in from the beginning, not added as an afterthought."
