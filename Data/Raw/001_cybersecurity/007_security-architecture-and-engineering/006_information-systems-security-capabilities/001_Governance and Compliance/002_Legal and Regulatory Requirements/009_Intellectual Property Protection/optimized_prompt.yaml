active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In recent EDA IP theft cases (e.g., alleged theft of ASML lithography designs or chip IP by foreign entities),
    debate the relative effectiveness of technical standards like IEEE Std 1735-2014 versus legal/regulatory measures (patents,
    DMCA, GDPR). What gaps exist in trust models among authors, users, and vendors, and how can zero-trust architectures address
    them? Support with evidence from standards and cases.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - D1: Common misconception (e.g., confuse Digital Envelope with email encryption).

    - D2: Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''IEEE 1735 only for software, not hardware EDA'').

    - D3: Related but incorrect term (e.g., swap Rights Management with DRM). Base on voter priorities, research (e.g., truncated
    IEEE desc.), real cases. Ensure 70% difficulty from analysis/evaluation.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² CISSP domains. Topic:
  Intellectual Property Protection (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture & Engineering > Information Systems Security
  Capabilities > Governance & Compliance > Legal/Regulatory Requirements > IP Protection). Use provided research context (expanded:
  IEEE Std 1735-2014 defines XML methods for encrypting EDA IP – digital envelopes with keys, rights metadata (e.g., usage
  scopes like simulate-only), signatures; integrates with IP-XACT/Accellera; protects against theft in EDA like netlists/layouts.
  Broader IP: patents/copyrights/trademarks/trade secrets. Cases: EDA supply chain thefts. Sources: IEEE link above, NIST.gov,
  accellera.org).
