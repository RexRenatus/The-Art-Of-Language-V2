  discussion_prompt: 'Debate: Does compliance reporting (e.g., NIST CSF Profiles or ISO 27001 audits) ensure true cybersecurity,
    or is it merely ''checkbox security''? Support your position with examples of breaches in compliant organizations like
    Equifax (PCI DSS compliant but breached) or SolarWinds, and propose how reporting can bridge the gap to actual security.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Compliance guarantees no
    breaches''); 2) Confusable term (e.g., mix NIST with ISO); 3) Partial truth (e.g., outdated framework detail). Ensure
    distractors are realistic based on voter-noted pitfalls like checkbox security.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Compliance Reporting (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information Systems Security Capabilities > Governance
  and Compliance > Compliance Management > Compliance Reporting). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities,
  4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema to create optimized, university-level flashcards.


  Incorporate:

  - Bloom''s Taxonomy progression (use objectives provided).

  - Voter consensus: NIST CSF full details (Functions: ID, PR, DE, RS, RC; Profiles for reporting), ISO 27001, CIS Controls,
  GDPR, HIPAA; misconception: Compliance ≠ Security (e.g., Equifax breach).

  - Research context: Definitions (compliance, evidence, etc.), goals (stakeholder assurance).

  - Scaffolding layers for content depth.

  - Active learning ties (e.g., debate prompts as scenario questions).

  - Related concepts: Audits, risk assessments, security controls.

  - Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (nist.gov/cyberframework), ISO 27001:2022 (iso.org), CIS Controls v8 (cisecurity.org), GDPR (eur-lex.europa.eu),
  HIPAA (hhs.gov).


  Generate 50 flashcards following the exact schema: MCQs with distractors (per protocol), balanced Bloom''s/layers. Output
  ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects. Ensure explanations scaffold learning and reference layers/frameworks.'
