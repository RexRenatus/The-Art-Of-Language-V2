active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using JWTs versus session-based authentication in high-traffic
    APIs. Consider scalability, security risks (e.g., token theft), and alignment with Zero Trust. Support arguments with
    references to OWASP API Security Top 10 and NIST SP 800-228.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

      vs signed), or edge cases from OWASP Top 10.'
    - 1 semantic distractor (close synonym/misconception)
    - 1 reversal distractor (opposite of correct)
    - 1 unrelated/outdated distractor (e.g., legacy tech like Basic Auth)
    - 'Ensure 70% learner challenge: Test understanding, not trivia'

  Generate 50-75 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema: Each card is a JSON object with ''front'' (MCQ question +
  4 options A-D) and ''back'' (correct_answer bolded, explanation, distractor_analysis, active_learning_tie_in optional, bloom_level,
  scaffold_layer).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full list above]

  - Active Learning: Tie in where relevant.

  - Scaffolding: Balance cards: 20% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 30% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4.

  - Research Context: API defs, auth/authz, cloud-native, API Gateway, Zero Trust, JWTs. NIST SP 800-228 (full: Framework
  for secure API design/implement/eval: threat modeling, patterns like mutual TLS, continuous monitoring). OWASP API Sec Top
  10 (BOLA, auth broken, excessive data, etc.). Best practices: input val, error handling, rate limiting. Sources: NIST SP
  800-228 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-228), OWASP API Top 10 (owasp.org/API-Security/), OAuth 2.0 RFC 6749.

  - Prior Knowledge: Link to HTTP/REST, basic auth.

  - Big Picture: Critical for Zero Trust/cloud apps.


  Distractors: Follow protocol exactly (plausible, semantic/reversal/unrelated). Explanations: 2-4 sentences, pedagogical,
  reference objectives/layers/sources.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards. Ensure variety, no duplicates, university-level rigor.'
