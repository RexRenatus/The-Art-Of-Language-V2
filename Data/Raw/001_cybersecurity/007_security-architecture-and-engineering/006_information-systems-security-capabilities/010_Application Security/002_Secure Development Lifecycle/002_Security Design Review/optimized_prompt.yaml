active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between conducting a Security Design Review early in the
    SDLC versus later phases. Use real-world examples (e.g., Equifax breach) to argue how early integration could prevent
    vulnerabilities, and propose metrics to measure review effectiveness.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Use the following to generate high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized flashcards:


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the ''learning_objectives'' array here]


  **Active Learning Context:** Incorporate elements from [Insert ''active_learning'' object here] for scenario-based cards.


  **Scaffolding:** Base cards on progressive layers: [Insert ''scaffolding.layers'' array here]. Prerequisites: [Insert ''scaffolding.prerequisites''
  here].


  **Sources:** NIST SP 800-37 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-37.pdf), NIST SP 800-53
  (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf), OWASP SAMM (https://owaspsamm.org/), STRIDE
  Threat Model (Microsoft SDL).


  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly follow [Insert ''flashcard_schema.structure'' here]. Generate [flashcard_schema.quantity].
  Mix types per schema.types. Use distractor_protocol for MCQs.


  **Best Practices:**

  - Front: Promote active recall (e.g., ''What are the 6 steps of a Security Design Review?'').

  - Explanations: Tie to Bloom''s, real-world (e.g., breaches), voter priorities (e.g., SDLC integration).

  - University pedagogy: Scaffold from foundation to integration; include active elements like ''Apply to scenario X''.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"front": "...", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "distractors":
  ["..."], "source": "...", "bloom_level": "...", "scaffolding_layer": 1}}.
