active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the security trade-offs of using UDP-based protocols like RTP/SRTP in real-time
    media transport versus TCP/TLS. How do threats like packet loss and replay attacks impact choices, and what mitigations
    (e.g., DTLS PFS) are essential for enterprise compliance (NIST/IETF)? Provide evidence from RFCs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on\
  \ 'Media Transport Security' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information Systems Security\
  \ Capabilities > Data Protection and Privacy > Media Protection > Media Transport Security).\n\nIncorporate:\n- PRIOR KNOWLEDGE:\
  \ UDP/TCP, crypto basics (encryption, keys, CIA).\n- BIG PICTURE: Secures real-time media (VoIP/WebRTC) for NIST/IETF compliance.\n\
  - CONCEPT MAP: Central 'Media Transport Security' → Goals (CIA+Replay) → Protocols (RTP/SRTP/DTLS) → Standards (RFC 3711,\
  \ 6347, 9147, 5764, 9325) → Threats/Best Practices.\n- SCAFFOLDING: Balance 5-7 cards per layer (Layer1: Foundation defs/goals;\
  \ Layer2: Protocols/components; Layer3: Implementation/handshakes; Layer4: Integration/WebRTC/threats).\n- BLOOM'S: Align\
  \ to objectives (Remember: defs; Understand: roles; Apply: steps; Analyze: compare; Evaluate: threats; Create: design).\n\
  - ACTIVE LEARNING TIE-IN: Include 2-3 cards prompting discussion/problem-solving (e.g., 'Evaluate replay attack mitigation\
  \ in SRTP').\n- CONTENT COMPLETENESS: Cover threats (eavesdropping/tampering/replay/DoS), best practices (PFS, mandatory\
  \ encrypt, DTLS 1.3 over SDES), standards (SRTP RFC3711, DTLS-SRTP RFC5764, RFC9325 TLS/DTLS recs).\n\nUse exact FLASHCARD\
