active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Technical controls like DMARC are sufficient to eliminate
    phishing risks without user training.'' Provide evidence from real-world breaches (e.g., BEC incidents) and propose a
    balanced strategy.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Anti-Phishing Controls\
  \ (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information Systems Security Capabilities >\
  \ Malware Defense and Endpoint Protection > Email and Web Protection > Anti-Phishing Controls).\n\nGenerate 50-75 high-quality\
  \ flashcards using the provided schema. Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom's Taxonomy (objectives: [insert learning_objectives\
  \ array here]), active learning tie-ins (e.g., flashcards for discussion prep), and 4-layer scaffolding ([insert scaffolding\
  \ object here]). Ensure completeness: Cover phishing types (phishing, spear, whaling, BEC, popup windows, email bombing),\
  \ controls (SPF, DKIM, DMARC, email gateways, URL rewriters, sandboxing, web proxies, user training, simulated phishing,\
  \ AUP, IR plans), standards (NIST SP 800-177, CIS Controls).\n\nUse this exact schema for each flashcard as a JSON object\
