active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether DEP is still effective against advanced exploits like Return-Oriented
    Programming (ROP) chains. Consider bypass techniques, layered defenses such as ASLR/SEHOP/CFG, and real-world evidence
    from recent malware campaigns. Support your position with pros/cons and propose improvements.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs based on common misconceptions (e.g., 'DEP encrypts memory' vs 'marks non-executable';
      'ROP fully bypasses DEP' vs 'reuses existing code').
    - Use partial truths (e.g., ASLR randomizes addresses, not execution prevention).
    - Draw from limitations (ROP), incomplete configs, or confusions with related tech (ASLR/SEHOP).
    - Ensure distractors promote analysis (e.g., outdated views pre-NX hardware).

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full array from above]

  - Active Learning: [Insert full active_learning JSON]

  - Scaffolding: Use exactly 4 layers [Insert full scaffolding_layers JSON] for progressive coverage.


  Research Context: DEP prevents code execution in data memory via NX/XD bit; thwarts buffer overflows; hardware exceptions
  terminate processes; Windows implementation via policies/boot; limitations: ROP bypasses by chaining gadgets; integrates
  with ASLR/SEHOP/CFG; prerequisites: memory management.


  Voter Consensus (100%): Emphasize Bloom''s progression, Windows config steps, ROP limitations, layered defenses concept
  map, balanced misconceptions.


  Generate flashcards per this schema: [Insert full flashcard_schema JSON]. Output ONLY in JSON array of objects, each with
  ''front'', ''back'' (nested answer/explanation/references/active_learning_link), and ''metadata''. Ensure 40-60 cards, comprehensive
  coverage, high pedagogical value. No additional text.'
