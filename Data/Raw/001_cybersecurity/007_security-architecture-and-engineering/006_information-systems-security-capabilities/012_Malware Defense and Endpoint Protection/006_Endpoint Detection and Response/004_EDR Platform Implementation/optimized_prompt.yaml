active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Using the MITRE ATT&CK framework, debate how EDR platforms effectively address living-off-the-land techniques
    (e.g., fileless malware) versus their limitations and gaps in protecting IoT endpoints. Consider real-world implications
    for organizational security.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, Student A explains EDR vs. AV/XDR with examples/non-examples (e.g., behavioral detection of ransomware
    vs. signature-based AV failures) and common misconceptions (e.g., 'EDR is just an AV upgrade'). Student B quizzes the
    explainer and teaches back. Switch roles and peer-review accuracy.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: Design an EDR rollout for a 1000-endpoint organization post-breach. Include risk assessment,
    vendor selection via MITRE ATT&CK, phased deployment (pilot to scale), configuration tuning for false positives, SIEM/XDR
    integration, and response simulation. Use templates and peer-review plans.'

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ (4 options: 1 correct, 3 distractors): Distractors must be plausible based on common misconceptions
    (e.g., ''EDR relies solely on signatures like AV'' vs. behavioral; ''EDR is set-and-forget with no tuning needed''; ''XDR
    is limited to endpoints only''; ''Deployment skips pilot phase''). Draw from research (e.g., fileless malware gaps) and
    voter notes. Ensure 75% pass rate for experts.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert educational flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity (Domain: Security Architecture
  And Engineering > Information Systems Security Capabilities > Malware Defense and Endpoint Protection > Endpoint Detection
  and Response > EDR Platform Implementation). Your goal is to create 25 high-quality, optimized flashcards using university-style
  pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (via provided objectives), active learning reinforcement, 4-layer scaffolding, and web-grounded
  research.


  **Topic Hierarchy:** Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information Systems Security Capabilities >
  Malware Defense and Endpoint Protection > Endpoint Detection and Response > EDR Platform Implementation.


  **Research Context:** Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) continuously monitors endpoints (laptops, servers, mobiles,
  IoT) for threats using behavioral analytics, heuristics, ML to detect fileless malware/ransomware (unlike AV signatures).
  Key: sensors (collect telemetry), analytics engine, response console (isolate/kill). Differs from XDR (unified across network/cloud/email).
  Best practices: assess inventory, select via MITRE ATT&CK, phased deploy, tune false positives, integrate SIEM/SOAR, IR
  playbooks. Limitations: IoT gaps, living-off-the-land. Sources: ninjaone.com, microsoft.com, proofpoint.com.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the ''learning_objectives'' array here].


  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Reinforce via explanations (e.g., ''Links to discussion on MITRE gaps''; ''Supports peer-teaching
  of EDR vs. AV'').


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the ''scaffolding'' object here]. Structure flashcards across layers.


  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly output a JSON array of 25 flashcards matching this exact schema: [Insert the ''flashcard_schema.structure''
  details here]. Follow distractor protocol precisely.


  Link to prior knowledge (AV, IR). Ensure measurable, engaging, misconception-busting. Output ONLY the JSON array, no extra
  text.'
