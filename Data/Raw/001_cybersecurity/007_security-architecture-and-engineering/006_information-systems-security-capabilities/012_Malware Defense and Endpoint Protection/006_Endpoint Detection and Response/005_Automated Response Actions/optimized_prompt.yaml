active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of fully automated vs. human-approved response actions in EDR. Consider false positives,
    dwell time reduction, and NIST RS.MI guidelines. Categorize scenarios where each approach is best (e.g., low-risk IoC
    vs. high-impact ransomware).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
