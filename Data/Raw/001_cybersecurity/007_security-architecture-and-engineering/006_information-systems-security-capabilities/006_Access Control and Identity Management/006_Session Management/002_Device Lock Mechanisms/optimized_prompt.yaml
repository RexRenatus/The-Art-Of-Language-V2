    AAL3 only'' – wrong, can be AAL1), 2) Partial truths (e.g., mix AAL1/2 features), 3) Real-world errors (e.g., ''PIN is
    something you are''), 4) Voter-suggested gaps (e.g., ignore CSP role). Ensure distractors teach via explanation.'

  in defense-in-depth for data protection per NIST SP 800-63B (Digital Identity Guidelines: Authentication and Lifecycle Management,
  covering AAL1-3, CSP/Verifier/RP, authenticator lifecycle including device locks like PIN/biometrics).

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM JSON]

  - Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL 4 LAYERS FROM JSON]


  Generate flashcards following this exact schema: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD_SCHEMA FROM JSON]. Ensure coverage: 1/3 REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND,
  1/3 APPLY/ANALYZE, 1/3 EVALUATE/CREATE; equal per layer. Incorporate voter priorities: concrete examples (PIN, biometrics,
  auto-lock), NIST completeness (e.g., lockout policies, AAL mappings), prerequisites, pros/cons/vulns.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''type'': ''MCQ/Def/etc.'', ''bloom_level'': ''REMEMBER'', ''layer'': 1, ''question'':
