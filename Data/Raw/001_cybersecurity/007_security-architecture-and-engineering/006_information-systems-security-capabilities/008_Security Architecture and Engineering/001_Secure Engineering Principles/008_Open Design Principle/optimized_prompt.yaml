active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the merits of ''security by obscurity'' versus ''open design principle'': In small groups, argue
    whether openness inherently weakens security or strengthens it through collective scrutiny. Use examples from cryptography
    (e.g., Kerckhoffs'' principle) and modern frameworks (e.g., OWASP). Address common misconceptions and cite evidence from
    Saltzer and Schroeder''s principles.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    partial truth (e.g., ''partial obscurity allowed''), 1 unrelated term. Ensure distractors are realistic, sourced from
    contrasts like security by obscurity.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Secure Engineering Principles.
  Topic: Open Design Principle (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information Systems Security
  Capabilities > Security Architecture and Engineering > Secure Engineering Principles > Open Design Principle). Use the provided
  learning_objectives, active_learning components, scaffolding layers (4 progressive layers), and flashcard_schema to generate
  high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized flashcards.


  Incorporate:

  - Voter consensus: Bloom''s progression, best practices (peer review, open standards, public audits, publish rationales),
  sources (Kerckhoffs 1883, Saltzer & Schroeder 1975, OSA.org, OpenSSF.org), debate on obscurity vs. open design, problem-solving
  for cloud architecture, concept map.

  - Research: Transparency fosters scrutiny; contrasts obscurity; aligns with OSA (transparent architectures), OpenSSF (open-source
  security), OWASP.


  Generate flashcards strictly following the flashcard_schema: 40-60 cards, balanced by Bloom''s/scaffolding, specified formats,
  distractors, explanations. Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'',
  ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...''}]. Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, scaffolding from
  foundation to integration, measurable objectives. No adult/offensive content.'
