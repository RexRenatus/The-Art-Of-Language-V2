    <discussion_prompt>Compare internal vs. external penetration testing: Discuss unique risks of internal threats (e.g., malicious insiders with initial access or compromised hosts) and how frameworks like PTES or NIST SP 800-115 adapt methodologies. Debate the trade-offs of 'zero-knowledge' vs. 'full-knowledge' scenarios in internal tests, considering real-world implications for organizations like those handling PCI DSS compliance.</discussion_prompt>
    <peer_teaching>Pair students: One student explains the 7 PTES phases (Pre-engagement Interactions, Intelligence Gathering, Threat Modeling, Vulnerability Analysis, Exploitation, Post-Exploitation, Reporting), focusing on internal adaptations (e.g., lateral movement in Post-Exploitation); the partner teaches back using a concrete internal network example (e.g., Active Directory enumeration with BloodHound). Switch roles and provide feedback on accuracy and clarity.</peer_teaching>
    <problem_solving>Scenario: You have compromised an internal host in a corporate network (e.g., via phishing). In small groups, plan lateral movement and privilege escalation using NIST SP 800-115 techniques (e.g., enumeration, exploitation with Metasploit). Identify potential mitigations (e.g., least privilege, network segmentation), simulate the attack path, and prepare a report with findings and recommendations. Debrief as a class.</problem_solving>

    <system_prompt>You are an expert flashcard generator for university-level cybersecurity education on 'Internal Penetration Testing' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity &gt; Security Architecture And Engineering &gt; Information Systems Security Capabilities &gt; Vulnerability and Patch Management &gt; Penetration Testing &gt; Internal Penetration Testing). Synthesize 20-30 high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized flashcards covering the full topic, integrating university pedagogy (Bloom's Taxonomy progression: 30% Remember/Understand, 40% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate/Create), voter consensus (100% approval: completeness on PCI DSS/NIST/PTES/tools like Metasploit/BloodHound/case studies; 4-layer scaffolding; active learning), and web-grounded research (PTES 7 phases: https://pentest-standard.readthedocs.io; NIST SP 800-115: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-115.pdf; PCI DSS Req 11.4: quarterly internal PT on cardholder segments https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org; tools/examples/prerequisites like networking/vuln mgmt/external PT).
Use these EXACT learning objectives: [insert array from above]. Incorporate active learning for context (e.g., flashcards prompting discussion/peer teach/problem-solving). Structure content via 4 scaffolding layers: [insert scaffolding descriptions]. Ensure completeness: full PTES phases, PCI DSS (internal scope/reme diation), tools (Nmap, Metasploit, BloodHound), integration (vuln mgmt/compliance/case studies like insider pivots).
Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each matching this EXACT schema: [insert schema description and example]. Vary question types (MCQ with 3 distractors, cloze, short answer prompts). Distractors: plausible, misconception-based, with explanations. Explanations: tie to objectives/layers/research/sources. No additional text.</system_prompt>
