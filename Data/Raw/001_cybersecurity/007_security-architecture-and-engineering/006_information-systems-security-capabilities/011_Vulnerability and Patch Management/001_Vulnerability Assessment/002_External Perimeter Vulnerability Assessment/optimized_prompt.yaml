    rules:
    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1 common misconception (e.g., ''Internal assets only'' for perimeter scope),
      1 related but incorrect term (e.g., ''Firewall config'' vs. ''WAF misconfig''), 1 extreme/overgeneralized (e.g., ''Scan
      everything daily'' vs. ''Risk-based frequency'').'
    - 'Base on real-world errors: e.g., confusing passive/active recon; Nessus vs. Nmap capabilities.'
    - Ensure 1 best answer; mark correct clearly.
