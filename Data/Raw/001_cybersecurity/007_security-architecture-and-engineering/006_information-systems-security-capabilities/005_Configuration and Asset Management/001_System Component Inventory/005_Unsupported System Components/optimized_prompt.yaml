      ''increased susceptibility'').'

  Architecture and Engineering. Topic: Unsupported System Components (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And
  Engineering > Information Systems Security Capabilities > Configuration and Asset Management > System Component Inventory
  > Unsupported System Components). Voter consensus: 82.9% approval on completeness/pedagogy.


  Incorporate:

  - Research: Unsupported components (hw/sw EOL: no patches/updates/parts). Risks: Vuln exploitation. NIST SP 800-53 SA-22
  (Rev4: replace/justify; Rev5: alternatives/isolation). CIS Controls v8 Control 2 (inventory, end-of-support in procurement/ongoing
  mgmt).
