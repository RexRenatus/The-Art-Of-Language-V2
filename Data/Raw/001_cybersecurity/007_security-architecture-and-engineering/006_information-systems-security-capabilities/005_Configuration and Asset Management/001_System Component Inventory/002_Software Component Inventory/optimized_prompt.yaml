active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using SPDX versus CycloneDX for SBOM generation in a
    large enterprise environment. Consider factors like interoperability, tool support, and overhead. Link to real-world supply
    chain attacks like Log4j and how SBOM standards could have mitigated them.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Related terms (e.g., SPDX vs SPDX-lite); 3) Partial truths (e.g., CycloneDX only for containers); 4) Voter-suggested
    errors (e.g., wrong acronyms). Ensure 1 correct, others 25% plausible.'

  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards (10 Basic Q&A, 10 MCQ, 10 Scenario) optimized for Anki/Spaced Repetition. Cover the
  full topic hierarchy and integrate:


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full array from ''learning_objectives'']


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full ''scaffolding'' object]. Distribute flashcards: 8 Layer 1, 8 Layer 2, 7 Layer 3, 7
  Layer 4.


  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Incorporate elements like discussion debates (SPDX vs CycloneDX), peer teaching (concept maps),
  problem-solving (scenarios).


  **Schema:** Strictly follow [flashcard_schema.structure]. Use distractor_protocol for MCQs. Every card must have explanation_requirements.


  **Content Sources:** CISA.gov SBOM definitions (SBOM as nested inventory; component/dependency types); NIST supply chain;
  Tools: Syft/Trivy; Standards: SPDX/CycloneDX; Examples: SolarWinds/Log4j. Link to prior: Hardware inventory/CMDB.


  **Output Format:** JSON array of objects: [{''type'': ''MCQ|Basic|Scenario'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...''}]. Ensure
  progressive complexity, measurable Bloom''s progression, and voter consensus (e.g., concept map, implementation steps).'
