active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a rapidly evolving threat landscape (e.g., supply chain attacks like SolarWinds), should organizations
    favor Ongoing Authorization over Static Authorization? Debate the pros, cons, real-world examples, and implications for
    maintaining Authorization to Operate (ATO) under FISMA/FedRAMP.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    security analyst); 2) Partial truths (e.g., Static Auth as ''always continuous''); 3) Edge cases (e.g., minor changes
    not needing approval); 4) Voter priorities (e.g., incomplete Static Auth definitions). Ensure one best answer.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  Change Authorization and Approval (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information Systems
  Security Capabilities > Configuration and Asset Management > Change Management > Change Authorization and Approval).


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste array above]

  - Active Learning: [paste object above]

  - Scaffolding: [paste array above]

  - Prior Knowledge: Links to asset inventories/baseline configs.

  - Key Content: Definitions (Change: system mods; Authorization: AO risk acceptance; Approval: sign-off); RMF integration;
  Static Authorization (periodic ATO, truncated completion: fixed snapshots, manual reviews for compliance like FISMA); Ongoing
  Authorization (continuous, dynamic via monitoring); Big Picture: Maintains ATO in FedRAMP/FISMA; Prevents risks in dynamic
  envs.


  Generate 40 flashcards following the exact schema:

  [ paste flashcard_schema.structure ]

  Use schema types, distractor protocol, balance, and quantity. Ensure completeness (e.g., full Static/Ongoing contrast).
  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects, e.g., [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}}]. No extra text.'
