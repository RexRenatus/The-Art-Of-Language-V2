active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between reducing false positives through overly strict rule
    tuning (risk of missing true threats) versus maintaining high sensitivity (risk of alert fatigue). Use voter-suggested
    causes and mitigations to support arguments, and connect to NIST compliance requirements.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''False negatives
    cause fatigue'' instead of positives); 2) Partial truths (e.g., ''Increase alert volume'' vs. reduce FPs); 3) Related
    but incorrect concepts (e.g., ''Tool sprawl reduces alerts'' vs. amplifies). Ensure distractors test analysis/evaluation.'
