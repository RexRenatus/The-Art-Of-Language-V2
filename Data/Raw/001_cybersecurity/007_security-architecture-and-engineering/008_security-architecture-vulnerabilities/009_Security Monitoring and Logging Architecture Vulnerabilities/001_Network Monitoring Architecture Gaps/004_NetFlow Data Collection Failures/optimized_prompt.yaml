active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the security implications of undetected NetFlow data collection failures
    in a SOC environment. How might these gaps enable advanced persistent threats (APTs)? Provide evidence from real-world
    breaches.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Generate 3 distractors that are plausible based on common errors (e.g., confuse NetFlow v5 with v9; mix ACL blocks with
      firewall rules; underestimate resource impact).
    - 'Base on voter consensus: Include incomplete configs, truncated Cisco refs (e.g., wrong ''ip flow-export source'' command).'
    - 'Ensure variety: One near-miss (similar config), one opposite (e.g., over-sampling vs. under), one unrelated (e.g.,
      SNMP instead of NetFlow).'

  Topic: **NetFlow Data Collection Failures** (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Security
  Architecture Vulnerabilities > Security Monitoring and Logging Architecture Vulnerabilities > Network Monitoring Architecture
  Gaps > NetFlow Data Collection Failures). Consensus: 82.9% approval.


  **Research Context (Complete Summary):** NetFlow (Cisco protocol) collects IP traffic flows (source/dest IP/ports/protocol).
  Components: Flow, Record, Exporter (router), Collector, Sampler. IPFIX (RFC 7011). Failures: 1. Incorrect Config (improper
  sampling, source interface—e.g., Cisco ''ip flow-export source Loopback0''; ACLs block UDP/2055). 2. Resource Exhaustion
  (high CPU/memory on exporter). 3. Connectivity (firewalls/routing). 4. Collector Overload. 5. Others (version mismatch v5/v9/IPFIX,
  multicast/VRF misconfigs). Mitigations: Verify configs (''show ip flow export''), redundancy, health monitoring. Sources:
  Cisco IOS NetFlow Config Guide (cisco.com), RFC 7011 (ietf.org), NetFlow Analyzer docs (manageengine.com).


  **Pedagogy:** Align to Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives [insert list above]. Prerequisites: Basic networking/IP/Cisco IOS. Scaffolding:
  [insert layers]. Active Learning: Use for context/inspiration.


  **Task:** Generate 40-50 flashcards per **Flashcard Schema** [insert schema]. Ensure high-quality: University-level (active
  recall, spaced repetition). Questions scaffold from foundation to integration. MCQs test misconceptions. Output as JSON
  array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}, ''metadata'': {...}}, ...]. Vary difficulty; cover all failures/mitigations.'
