  discussion_prompt: 'In a zero-trust security model, debate the trade-offs of using SPAN/mirror ports versus network TAPs
    for monitoring: When might misconfigurations in SPAN create persistence opportunities for attackers? Support with real-world
    breach examples (e.g., data exfiltration via unsecured dest ports).'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
