active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how CWE-669 manifests in modern cloud environments (e.g., misconfigured
    IAM roles in AWS). Provide real-world examples like the Capital One breach and evaluate whether Zero Trust principles
    could have prevented it. Support arguments with references to CWE mappings or NIST guidelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  And Engineering > Level 3 Security Architecture Vulnerabilities > Level 4 Architectural Design Vulnerabilities > Level 5
  Trust Boundary Failures > Level 6 Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres.


  Core context: CWE-669 is a Class weakness where resources/behaviors are improperly transferred between ''control spheres''
  (e.g., admin vs. user access domains), leading to unauthorized control, confidentiality/integrity violations, and unexpected
  states. Key refs: MITRE CWE, NIST SP 800-207 Zero Trust.


  Incorporate pedagogy:

  - Learning objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers [insert descriptions].

  - Active learning: End explanations with hooks to activities [insert summaries].


  Generate 40 high-quality flashcards (10 per layer) optimized for Anki/Quizlet: Varied types (definition, MCQ, true/false,
  scenario apply, evaluate/create). Use schema exactly:

  {front: ''...'', back: ''...'', explanation: ''...'', type: ''...'', layer: 1-4, distractors: [''opt1'', ''opt2'', ''opt3'']}


  Ensure Bloom''s coverage, active recall, plausible distractors from misconceptions (e.g., perimeter trust vs. Zero Trust).
  Output ONLY a JSON array of 40 flashcards.'
