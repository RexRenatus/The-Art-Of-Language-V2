active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, share real-world examples of SPOFs from cybersecurity incidents (e.g., a DNS server
    outage or single firewall failure). Analyze how they violated secure design principles and debate mitigation strategies
    using NIST frameworks. Encourage critical thinking by challenging peers to propose alternative architectures.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Single Point of Failure
  (SPOF)'' under the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Security Architecture Vulnerabilities
  > Architectural Design Vulnerabilities > Secure Design Principle Violations > Single Point of Failure.


  Incorporate this research context: SPOF is a critical component whose failure halts the system (hardware/software/process).
  Impacts availability/resilience; cascading effects. Key frameworks: NIST SP 800-207 (ZTA reduces perimeter SPOFs), NIST
  SP 800-53 Rev5 (contingency controls).
