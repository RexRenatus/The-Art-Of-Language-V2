      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The star property ('no write down') prevents untrusted subjects from writing information to lower security levels. This is crucial for preventing covert channels, where information might be indirectly leaked downwards through seemingly innocuous operations.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly identify 'no read up' violations, integrity issues, or availability problems, failing to recognize the star property's specific role in preventing downward information flow and covert channels.",
        "analogy": "The star property acts like a one-way gate for information, ensuring sensitive data can't 'leak' down to less secure areas, thus preventing secret messages from being passed indirectly."
