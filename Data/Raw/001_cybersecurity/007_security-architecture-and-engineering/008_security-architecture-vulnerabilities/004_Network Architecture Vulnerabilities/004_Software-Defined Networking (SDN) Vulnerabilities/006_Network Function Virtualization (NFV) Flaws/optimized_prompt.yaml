active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: 'In pairs: Student A explains VM escape attacks in NFV hypervisors with a step-by-step diagram; Student B
    teaches back mitigations (e.g., SR-IOV, secure boot) and quizzes A. Switch roles for MANO flaws.'
  problem_solving: Given a real-world telco NFV DoS scenario (e.g., resource exhaustion via malicious VNF orchestration),
    teams design and prototype a mitigation strategy using security patterns, SRA, and SDN integration. Present and peer-review
    solutions.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1. Common misconception (e.g., ''NFV eliminates hypervisors''
    instead of ''relies on them''); 2. Related but wrong concept (e.g., SDN controller vs. MANO); 3. Partial truth exaggerated
    (e.g., ''Hypervisor compromise only affects one VM'' vs. potential cascade). Ensure distractors teach by reinforcing correct
    reasoning in explanations.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Network Function Virtualization
  (NFV) Flaws (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Security Architecture Vulnerabilities
  > Network Architecture Vulnerabilities > SDN Vulnerabilities > NFV Flaws).


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for spaced repetition and Bloom''s Taxonomy mastery. Cover all learning objectives:
  [INSERT LEARNING OBJECTIVES HERE]. Incorporate active learning hooks in explanations. Structure content across 4 scaffolding
  layers: [INSERT SCAFFOLDING HERE]. Ensure completeness on key flaws: Hypervisor Compromise (VM Escape, DoS), Orchestration
  Flaws (MANO APIs), VNF-Specific (insecure images), Multi-Tenancy Risks (isolation failures).


  Prior Knowledge: SDN basics, virtualization (hypervisors/VMs). Big Picture: NFV flaws critical for 5G/edge security shift.
  Concept Map: As in Layer 1.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: [INSERT FLASHCARD SCHEMA HERE]. Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'',
  ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''tags'': [''#tag1'', ''#tag2'']}, ...]. Balance Bloom''s levels (20% Remember/Understand,
  30% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate, 20% Create). Vary formats for engagement. Sources: ETSI NFV, NIST SP 800-125B, real attacks
  (VENOM, etc.). Make explanations pedagogical for active recall.'
