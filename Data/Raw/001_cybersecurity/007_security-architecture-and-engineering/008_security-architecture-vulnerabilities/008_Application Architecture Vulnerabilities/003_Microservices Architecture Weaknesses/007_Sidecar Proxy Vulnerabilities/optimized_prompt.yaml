  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of sidecar proxies in microservices: Do the benefits (e.g.,
    observability, traffic routing) outweigh the risks (e.g., malicious injection, increased attack surface)? Use real-world
    examples like Istio/Envoy compromises and reference Kubernetes threat models to support your arguments.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Topic Context & Hierarchy:**

  - Level 1: Cybersecurity

  - Level 2: Security Architecture And Engineering

  - Level 3: Security Architecture Vulnerabilities

  - Level 4: Application Architecture Vulnerabilities

  - Level 5: Microservices Architecture Weaknesses

  - Level 6: Sidecar Proxy Vulnerabilities


  **Key Research Facts:** Sidecar proxies (e.g., Envoy in Istio) are containers in Kubernetes pods that intercept traffic
  for management/security/observability. Vulnerabilities include malicious injection (stealthy compromise, data interception,
  privilege escalation, persistence). Alternatives: sidecarless (eBPF, gRPC). Mitigate via admission controllers, RBAC, monitoring.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the exact array from ''learning_objectives'' above]. Generate 40-50 flashcards evenly distributed
  across objectives/Bloom''s levels (8-10 per major level).


  **Scaffolding:** Progressively cover 4 layers [Insert exact scaffolding array]. Assign each flashcard to one layer.


  **Active Learning Ties:** Weave in elements from discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving [reference briefly in explanations].


  **Generation Rules:**

  - 70% multiple-choice (4 options), 20% short-answer/cloze, 10% scenario-based.

  - Strictly follow ''flashcard_schema'' output format for EACH card.

  - Ensure high-quality: Questions unambiguous, explanations pedagogical (link to objectives/layers), distractors per protocol.

  - Vary difficulty: 30% basic recall, 40% application/analysis, 30% evaluation/creation.

  - Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, e.g., [{question: ''...'', ...}, ...]. No extra text.'
