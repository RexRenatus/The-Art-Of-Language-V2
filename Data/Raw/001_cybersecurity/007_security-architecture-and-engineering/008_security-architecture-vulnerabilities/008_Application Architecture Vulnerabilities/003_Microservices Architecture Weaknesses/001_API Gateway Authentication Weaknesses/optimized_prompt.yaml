active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using JWT versus Opaque Tokens for API Gateway authentication
    in high-traffic microservices. Consider scalability, security, and performance, referencing NIST SP 800-228 guidelines.
    Propose scenarios where one outperforms the other and justify with real-world examples like token revocation challenges.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truths (e.g., ''JWT is always secure'' vs. ''without validation''); 3) Edge cases from research (e.g., OAuth
    flows mixed up); 4) Real vulns (e.g., ''no signature check'' as distractor for valid practice). Ensure distractors teach
    by contrast; avoid obvious wrongs.'
