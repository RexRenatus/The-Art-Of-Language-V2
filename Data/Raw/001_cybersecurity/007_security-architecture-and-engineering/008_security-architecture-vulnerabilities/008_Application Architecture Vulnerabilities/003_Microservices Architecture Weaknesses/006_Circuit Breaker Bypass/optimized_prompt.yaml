  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of implementing circuit breakers in microservices: How
    might aggressive circuit breaker configurations inadvertently enable bypass vulnerabilities, and what alternatives (e.g.,
    rate limiting) could complement them? Use real-world examples from outages like the 2018 GitHub incident involving cascading
    failures.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security Architecture Vulnerabilities.\
  \ Use the FIXED topic_hierarchy below for all context. Generate high-quality flashcards ONLY for 'Circuit Breaker Bypass'\
