active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate why WebSockets introduce unique risks like Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking
    (CSWSH) compared to traditional CSRF attacks in HTTP applications. Provide examples from real-world applications (e.g.,
    chat apps) and propose two mitigation strategies, justifying their feasibility.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse CSWSH with CSRF; mix ws:// risks
      with HTTP-only issues).
    - 'Distractor 1: Partial truth (e.g., ''ws:// is encrypted like HTTPS'').'
    - 'Distractor 2: Related but wrong concept (e.g., ''CSWSH prevented by CORS alone'').'
    - 'Distractor 3: Extreme/overstated (e.g., ''All WebSockets are insecure by design'').'
    - Ensure distractors promote analysis by being close to correct answer.
    quantity: 20-30 flashcards total, balanced across scaffolding layers and Bloom's levels (at least 3-5 per objective).
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in WebSocket Security Weaknesses\
  \ (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Security Architecture Vulnerabilities > Application\
  \ Architecture Vulnerabilities > Web Application Architecture Flaws > WebSocket Security Weaknesses). Use university pedagogy:\
  \ Bloom's Taxonomy, active learning, and scaffolding.\n\n**Learning Objectives:** [Insert the full learning_objectives array\
  \ here].\n\n**Active Learning Integration:** Tie flashcards to discussion (e.g., CSWSH vs CSRF), peer teaching (explain\
  \ one weakness), and problem-solving (code vuln ID/fix).\n\n**Scaffolding Layers:** Generate flashcards progressively:\n\
  - Layer 1: Foundation (basic terms).\n- Layer 2: Components (weaknesses like ws:// encryption lack, CSWSH).\n- Layer 3:\
  \ Implementation (mitigations: wss://, origin checks).\n- Layer 4: Integration (OWASP ties, app architecture).\n\n**Research\
  \ Context:** WebSockets enable full-duplex comms via HTTP handshake; weaknesses: ws:// plaintext (MITM/eavesdropping, OWASP\
  \ A3), CSWSH (hijacks via cookies for persistent attacks).\n\n**Flashcard Generation:** Output 25 flashcards in JSON array.\
  \ Follow exact schema:\n{\n  \"flashcards\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"layer\": 1,\n      \"bloom_level\": \"\
