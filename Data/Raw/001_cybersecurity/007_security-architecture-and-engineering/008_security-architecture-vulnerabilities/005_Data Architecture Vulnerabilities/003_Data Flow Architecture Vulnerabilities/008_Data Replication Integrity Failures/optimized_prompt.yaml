active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how data replication integrity failures could lead to regulatory non-compliance
    (e.g., GDPR data accuracy requirements or HIPAA integrity mandates). Provide examples from real-world incidents like the
    2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack and propose two preventive measures.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Completed Research Context:**

  Data replication ensures HA, DR, performance but risks integrity failures (corruption, loss, inconsistency, staleness).
  Causes: network issues (packet loss, partitions), hardware failures, software bugs, misconfigurations, human error, attacks
  (ransomware). Impacts CIA triad. Standards: NIST SP 800-53 (SI-7 Software/Firmware/Information Integrity, SC-23 Session
  Authenticity); NIST SP 1800-25 ''Data Integrity: Identifying and Protecting Assets Against Ransomware''; ISO 27001 (A.12.2.1
  Malware Controls, A.8.1 Asset Management); CIS Controls v8 (Control 3 Data Protection, Control 13 Data Recovery). Best practices:
  checksums, quorum, monitoring (AWS DMS validation).
