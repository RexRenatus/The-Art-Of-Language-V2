  discussion_prompt: 'Debate in groups: Which common data exfiltration method (e.g., DNS tunneling vs. HTTPS abuse) poses
    the greatest challenge for monitoring in a modern enterprise network, and why? Support arguments with real-world examples
    (e.g., from SentinelOne or NCSC reports), detection trade-offs, and propose targeted countermeasures.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
