      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Removable media containing unencrypted backups presents a significant risk because if the media is lost or stolen, the data is immediately accessible, since there is no encryption layer to protect it. This directly violates data confidentiality principles.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors highlight media defects, automated deletion, or manual processes, none of which address the fundamental security risk of exposing sensitive data through physical loss or theft of unencrypted backups.",
        "analogy": "Leaving a sensitive document on a park bench is similar to storing an unencrypted backup on removable media; if the media is lost, the information is exposed."
