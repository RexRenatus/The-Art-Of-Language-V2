  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of delegating infrastructure management to MSPs: How does
    it enhance efficiency but amplify security risks? Use the Shared Responsibility Model and real-world breaches (e.g., Kaseya)
    to support arguments, aiming to propose balanced TPRM strategies.'

  Topic: Infrastructure Management Delegation Risks (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Security
  Architecture Vulnerabilities > Third-Party and Supply Chain Architecture Vulnerabilities > Managed Service Provider Architecture
  Gaps > Infrastructure Management Delegation Risks). Big picture: Builds resilient third-party integrations for Security
  Architecture mastery.


  Content Summary (complete, web-grounded):

  - Prior Knowledge: Security Architecture basics, TPRM, Shared Responsibility Model.

  - Core Concepts: Infrastructure Management Delegation (assigning IT infra mgmt to MSPs/vendors); TPRM (lifecycle risk mgmt);
  SCRM (supply chain focus); Shared Responsibility (cloud delineations).

  - Key Risks: 1. Loss of Control/Visibility (unpatched/misconfigured systems; e.g., cloud provider incomplete disclosure).
  2. Inadequate Practices (vendor poor hygiene). 3. Supply Chain Vulns (SolarWinds: Orion backdoor via build process; Kaseya:
  REvil ransomware through MSP VSA tool, chaining to clients).

  - Mitigations: NIST SP 800-161 (supply chain controls), TPRM steps (due diligence checklists, contracts with audit rights,
  SOC 2 reviews), continuous monitoring.

  - Sources: NIST SP 800-161r1, NIST SP 800-53, CISSP Official CBK, SolarWinds OPM Report, Kaseya Breach Analysis (CISA alerts).

  - Concept Map: ''Infrastructure Delegation Risks'' → Loss of Control (visibility gaps) → Inadequate Practices (vendor hygiene)
  → Supply Chain Vulns (e.g., SolarWinds/Kaseya) → Mitigations (TPRM/SCRM/NIST).
