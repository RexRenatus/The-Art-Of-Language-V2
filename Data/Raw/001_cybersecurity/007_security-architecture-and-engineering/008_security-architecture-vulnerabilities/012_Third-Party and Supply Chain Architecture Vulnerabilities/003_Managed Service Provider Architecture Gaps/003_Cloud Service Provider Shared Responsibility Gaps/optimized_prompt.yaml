active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the shared responsibility gaps exposed in the Capital One AWS S3 breach
    (2019) or Uber Okta breach (2022). Argue whether the primary fault lay with the customer, CSP, or shared misunderstanding,
    and propose how zero-trust architecture could prevent recurrence. Support with evidence from CSP documentation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions/gaps: 1) Over-attribution to
    CSP (e.g., ''CSP handles IAM''); 2) Underestimation of customer duties (e.g., ignore data encryption); 3) Confusion across
    models (e.g., mix IaaS/PaaS responsibilities). Ensure distractors are realistic from breaches like Capital One.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² CISSP domains. Topic:
  Cloud Service Provider Shared Responsibility Gaps (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Security
  Architecture Vulnerabilities > Third-Party and Supply Chain Architecture Vulnerabilities > Managed Service Provider Architecture
  Gaps > Cloud Service Provider Shared Responsibility Gaps). Prior knowledge: Basic IaaS/PaaS/SaaS, least privilege, defense-in-depth.


  Incorporate this research context: [INSERT FULL RESEARCH CONTEXT HERE, including completed Key Gaps: identity mgmt (customer
  IAM), encryption/compliance (customer data), patching (IaaS), examples (Capital One S3, Uber Okta), standards (NIST, CSA
  CCM), mitigations (zero-trust)].
