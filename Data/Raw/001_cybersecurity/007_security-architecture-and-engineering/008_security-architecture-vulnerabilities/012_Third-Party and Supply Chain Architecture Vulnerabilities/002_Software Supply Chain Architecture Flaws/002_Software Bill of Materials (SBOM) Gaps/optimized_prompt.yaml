  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: 'Pair up: Student A teaches Student B about one SBOM gap (e.g., lack of real-time updates) with an analogy
    (e.g., ''ingredient list without expiration dates''), including a diagram of supply chain flow. Switch roles and quiz
    each other on misconceptions (e.g., SBOM scans for vulns).'
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A software vendor faces a Log4Shell-like vulnerability without SBOM provenance. In teams, map
    the supply chain flaws, generate a remedial SBOM using Syft, analyze format gaps (SPDX vs. CycloneDX), and evaluate integration
    with vuln scanners like Grype.'

    - Based on common misconceptions (e.g., ''SBOM automatically includes CVEs'' vs. correct ''lists components only'').

    - Voter gaps (e.g., ''tool maturity'' vs. distractor ''perfect accuracy'').

    - Research context (e.g., ''SPDX focuses on vulns'' vs. correct ''licenses'').

    - Prior knowledge errors (e.g., confuse with vuln scanners). Ensure distractors are 70-80% plausible to challenge learners.'

  Incorporate this optimized pedagogy:

  - **Learning Objectives** (Bloom''s progression): [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ''learning_objectives''].

  - **Active Learning**: Tie flashcards to [discussion, peer_teaching, problem_solving from ''active_learning''].

  - **Scaffolding**: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers [INSERT FULL ''scaffolding'' DETAILS]. Ensure progressive complexity.

  - **Research Context**: Core concepts (SBOM as ingredient list, provenance, transparency); Standards (SPDX license-focused,
  CycloneDX vuln-focused); Gaps (adoption barriers, inconsistent formats, missing provenance/timeliness/accuracy, tool maturity,
  regulatory; e.g., Log4Shell); Tools (Syft/Grype); Sources (CISA.gov, ENISA.europa.eu, cyber.gc.ca, NTIA).

  - Misconceptions: SBOM ≠ vuln scanner; not all include runtime deps.


  **Generate 40-50 flashcards** using EXACT ''flashcard_schema'' format. Balance: 10 per layer, span all Bloom''s levels.
  Use voter priorities: explicit gaps section, examples (Log4Shell), tools (Syft), comparisons (SPDX/CycloneDX), strategies
  (SLSA).
