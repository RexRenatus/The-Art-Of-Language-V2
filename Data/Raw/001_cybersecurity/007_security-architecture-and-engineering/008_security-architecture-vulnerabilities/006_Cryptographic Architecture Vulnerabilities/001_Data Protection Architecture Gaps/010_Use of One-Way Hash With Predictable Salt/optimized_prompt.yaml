active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Why does a predictable salt undermine the security of one-way hashes? Debate real-world examples of predictable
    salts (e.g., username, timestamp) versus cryptographically secure random salts, and discuss their impact on rainbow table
    attacks. Challenge the misconception that any unique value (like a username) is a sufficient salt.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    random enough''). Ensure distractors test deeper understanding.'
