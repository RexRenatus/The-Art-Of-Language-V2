active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a world where HPKP is deprecated for browsers due to brittleness, debate the merits of implementing
    certificate pinning in mobile applications versus relying on Certificate Transparency (CT) and CAA records. Provide pros,
    cons, real-world examples (e.g., CA compromises like DigiNotar), and recommend a hybrid approach for high-security apps.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    not keys); 2) Mix with certificate hashing (whole cert vs SPKI); 3) HPKP legacy (deprecated, browser-only); 4) CA bundles
    or CRLs (revocation, not pinning). Ensure plausible but incorrect (e.g., ''Pins the entire certificate chain'' vs ''Pins
    specific public keys'').'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Topic: ''Certificate Pinning Not Implemented''
  (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Security Architecture Vulnerabilities > Cryptographic
  Architecture Vulnerabilities > Cryptographic Signature and Validation Flaws > Certificate Pinning Not Implemented). Use
  provided research context, sources (RFC 7469: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7469; NIST SP 800-52 Rev. 2: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-52r2.pdf),
  and voter consensus (100% approval).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the array above]

  - Active Learning: Use elements for reflection/feedback in explanations.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4.

  - Schema: Output ONLY JSON array of flashcards. Each: {''type'': ''Q&A|Cloze|MC'', ''layer'': 1-4, ''blooms'': ''REMEMBER|etc'',
  ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...''}.


  Ensure university pedagogy: Scaffolding progression, active recall, spaced repetition. Distractors from protocol. Explanations
  with feedback/reflection. Balance: 15 Q&A, 15 Cloze, 15-30 MC. High-quality, misconception-busting, real-world tied.'
