active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the pros and cons of agent-based vs. agentless posture assessment in Zero Trust for IoT devices.
    Consider evasion techniques like spoofing or exploiting check intervals, and discuss scalability in hybrid/remote environments.
    Support arguments with real-world examples (e.g., Mirai botnet).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards (aim for 5 per Bloom''s level) optimized for Anki/Quizlet using university pedagogy:
  Bloom''s Taxonomy progression, active learning integration, 4-layer scaffolding, voter consensus (completeness on evasion/spoofing/IoT,
  pedagogy emphasis).


  CONTENT SCOPE (Complete/Synthesized from Research: Portnox.com/device-posture, NIST SP 800-207, SentinelOne.com/endpoint-security):

  - Foundation (Layer 1): Definitions, prior knowledge (ZTA, endpoint basics), big picture (resilient ZTA for hybrid work).

  - Components (Layer 2): Weaknesses - Incomplete data (blind spots/outdated), Evasion (spoofing, assessment windows, agent
  tampering, IoT/legacy limits), false pos/neg, scalability.

  - Implementation (Layer 3): Agent vs. agentless, mitigations (ML anomaly, frequent/random checks).

  - Integration (Layer 4): ZTA defense-in-depth, optimizations.


  Use provided Learning Objectives, Active Learning prompts, Scaffolding layers exactly for alignment. Follow Flashcard Schema
  strictly: MCQ front/back JSON format, distractor protocol, detailed explanations with sources/tags.


  Output ONLY a JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}, ''tags'': [...]}, ...]. Ensure variety: 10 Remember/Understand
  (Layer 1-2), 10 Apply/Analyze (Layer 2-3), 10 Evaluate/Create (Layer 3-4). Tag each with ''hierarchy_level6'', relevant
  weakness, Bloom''s.'
