  discussion_prompt: 'In a Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) deployment, debate the statement: ''Least privilege enforcement
    failures are inevitable due to human error in privilege management.'' Support your position with references to NIST SP
    800-207 components (PE, PA, PEP) and real-world breaches like Colonial Pipeline. What automation strategies could make
    strict enforcement feasible?'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    escalation''); 2) Related but incorrect term (e.g., ''RBAC instead of ABAC''); 3) Partial truth (e.g., ''PEP only enforces
    network access, not privileges''). Ensure distractors test nuance in ZTA components or failure types.'

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use for scenario-based cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards: 10 Layer 1, 15 Layer 2, 15 Layer 3, 10 Layer 4.

  - Research Context: Core concepts (Least Privilege, failures: overly permissive, stale, creep, etc.); NIST SP 800-207 (ZT
  components: PE/PA/PEP, continuous validation); NIST SP 1800-35 (ZT implementation guide, Vol. 2 ZTNA, automate reviews/JIT/PAM);
  Real-world: Colonial Pipeline; Best practices: Audit/JIT/PAM/automation; Sources: NIST SP 800-207, NIST SP 1800-35, CIS
  Controls v8.

  - Concept Map: Central ''Least Privilege Failures'' → Types → ZTA Components → NIST → ZTNA Integration.


  Generate flashcards per schema: Question/Answer + Explanation + References. Balance Bloom''s (Remember/Understand: recall/definitions;
  Apply/Analyze: scenarios/ZTA; Evaluate/Create: critique/design). Use distractors for MCQs. Output ONLY a JSON array of 40-50
  flashcards in exact schema format. Ensure university-level pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, higher-order
  thinking.'
