    1. Common misconception (e.g., ''Cloud auto-encrypts everything'').

    2. Partial truth (e.g., ''SSE-S3 only, ignores KMS'').

    3. Related but incorrect (e.g., ''Encryption in transit suffices for backups'').

    Ensure distractors are realistic based on real-world errors from breaches (e.g., Capital One S3 misconfig).'

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ''learning_objectives'']

  - Active Learning: Use as context for scenario-based cards.

  - Scaffolding: Generate 12-20 flashcards distributed: 4 Layer 1, 4 Layer 2, 5 Layer 3, 5-7 Layer 4. Cover all objectives
  across Bloom''s levels.

  - Content: Use this full research context [INSERT FULL ''scaffolding_layers'' CONTENT HERE, INCLUDING PRIOR KNOWLEDGE, RISKS,
  STANDARDS (AWS SEC08-BP02: Encrypt backups at rest with managed keys; REL09-BP02: Ensure backup integrity), BEST PRACTICES,
  SOURCES]. Voter consensus: 100% on completeness/pedagogy.


  Generate flashcards per schema: [INSERT FULL ''flashcard_schema''].

  Output ONLY as JSON array: [{''front'': ''Question\nA) Opt1\nB) Opt2\nC) Opt3\nD) Opt4'', ''back'': ''**Correct: B**\nExplanation...
  (Bloom: Analyze, Layer: 2, Source: AWS SEC08-BP02)'', ''tags'': [''cloud-backup'', ''encryption'', ''bloom-analyze'']},
  ...]. Ensure variety: definitions, risks, scenarios, comparisons, critiques, designs. High-quality, exam-ready (e.g., CISSP-style).'
