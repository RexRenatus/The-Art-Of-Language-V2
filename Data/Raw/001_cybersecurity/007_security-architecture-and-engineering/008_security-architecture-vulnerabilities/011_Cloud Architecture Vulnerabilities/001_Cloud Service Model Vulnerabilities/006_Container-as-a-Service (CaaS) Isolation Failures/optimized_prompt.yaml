active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the misconception that container isolation is as robust as VM isolation
    due to the shared kernel. Use examples like CVE-2020-8559 (dockerd) to argue how this leads to real-world failures and
    propose zero-trust mitigations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Plausible based on misconceptions (e.g., 'Containers use full hypervisor isolation' for VM confusion).
    - Semantically similar terms (e.g., seccomp vs. SELinux).
    - Partial truths (e.g., 'Namespaces alone prevent escapes' ignoring kernel bugs).
    - Real-world inspired (e.g., wrong CVE details).
    - 'Balanced difficulty: 1 easy wrong, 1 medium (common mix-up), 1 hard (subtle nuance).'

  Additional Research: CNCF cloud-native security (whitepapers on supply chain, runtime security). Best practices: Pod Security
  Admission, seccomp/AppArmor, network policies, RBAC checklists. Examples: CVE-2019-5736 (runc escape via overlayfs), CVE-2020-8559
  (dockerd). Attacks: Host path mounts, namespace escapes, side-channels. Big picture: Zero-trust, prevents lateral movement.
