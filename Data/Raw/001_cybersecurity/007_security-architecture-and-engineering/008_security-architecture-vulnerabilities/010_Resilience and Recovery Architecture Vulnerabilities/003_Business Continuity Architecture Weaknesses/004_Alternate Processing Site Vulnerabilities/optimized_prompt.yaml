active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare vulnerabilities of colocation vs. hot/warm/cold alternate sites—which is best for a financial
    firm and why? Consider factors like cost, recovery time objective (RTO), and supply chain risks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Hot sites have
    no sync risks'' – ignores latency). 2) Partial truths (e.g., confuse warm/cold RTO). 3) Related but irrelevant concepts
    (e.g., mix BCP with IRP). Ensure distractors teach via negation.'

  **Context & Research (Completed):** Alternate processing site: Backup location for operations post-primary disruption. Key
  vulnerabilities: Supply chain (counterfeit/malicious insertion), physical/environmental (disasters/geopolitics), security
  gaps (weaker controls), data sync/integrity, network connectivity, management oversight. Site types: Hot (real-time mirror),
  Warm (periodic sync), Cold (manual restore), Colocation (shared). Mitigations: NIST SP 800-34 Rev. 1 (Contingency Planning:
  defines site types, testing); NIST SP 800-82 Rev. 3 (ICS Security: alternate sites for critical infra, supply chain vetting,
  secure comms); NIST SP 800-53 (CP family: Alternate Site, Backup). ISO 22301 (BCP). Examples: Colonial Pipeline (sync failures),
  SolarWinds (supply chain). Sources: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-34r1.pdf, https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-82r3.pdf,

  **Pedagogy Integration:** Use these exact learning objectives [insert array above]. Scaffolding: 4 layers [insert array
  above]. Active learning ties: Reference discussions/problems in explanations.


  **Generate 45 flashcards per schema [insert schema above]. Ensure progression: Foundation-heavy early, integration later.
  Concept map: Central ''Alternate Processing Site Vulnerabilities'' → branches to vulns → mitigations → BCP/DRP.
