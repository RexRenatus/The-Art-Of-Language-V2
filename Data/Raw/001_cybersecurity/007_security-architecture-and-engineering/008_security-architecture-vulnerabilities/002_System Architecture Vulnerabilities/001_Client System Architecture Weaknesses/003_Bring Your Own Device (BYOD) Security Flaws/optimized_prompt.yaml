  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of implementing BYOD in a post-COVID hybrid workforce:
    How do cost savings and employee satisfaction weigh against security flaws like data commingling and insider threats?
    Use real-world examples from breaches (e.g., lost personal devices exposing corporate data) to support arguments and propose
    balanced solutions.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Learning Objectives: [INSERT ARRAY FROM ABOVE].

  Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM ABOVE].

  Active Learning Tie-Ins: Reference discussion/peer/problem-solving in explanations where relevant.

  Big Picture: Fits Security Architecture as client-side vulnerabilities in hybrid workforces; critical post-COVID for enterprise
  resilience. Prior Knowledge: Malware, phishing, encryption, endpoint security.

  Key Content (complete/research-grounded): Flaws - Lack of Centralized Control (unpatched, no AV; risk: malware/phishing),
  Data Commingling (corporate/personal mix; risk: exposure, hard wipes), Insider Threats (accidental sharing/malicious exfiltration),
  Lost/Stolen Devices, Shadow IT. Mitigations: MDM, policies, zero-trust.


  Generate exactly 25 flashcards following the schema: For each - bloom_level (REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND/APPLY/ANALYZE/EVALUATE/CREATE),
  scaffolding_layer (Layer 1-4), question (MCQ/cloze/short-answer), correct_answer, distractors (EXACTLY 3, plausible protocol),
  explanation (pedagogical, with objective/layer tie-in).

  Output as JSON array of objects matching flashcard_schema format. Ensure progression: 20% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 40% APPLY/ANALYZE,
  40% EVALUATE/CREATE. Distractors plausible (e.g., confuse commingling with encryption failure). High-quality, error-free,
  educational.'
