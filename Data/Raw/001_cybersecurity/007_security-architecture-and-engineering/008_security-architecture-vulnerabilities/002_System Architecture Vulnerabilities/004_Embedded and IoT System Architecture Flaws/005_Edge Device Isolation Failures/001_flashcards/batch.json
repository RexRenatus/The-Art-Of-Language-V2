        "core_logic": "Physical isolation involves using distinct hardware components or secure enclaves (like TEEs) that are architecturally separated from the main processing environment. This separation is inherent to the hardware design, therefore making it highly resistant to logical attacks that might compromise software-based isolation, because it's protected by physical boundaries.",
