active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between rapid VM deployment using templates and the risk
    of vulnerability propagation in scalable cloud environments. Reference real-world examples from enterprise VDI or Azure
    VM deployments and propose balanced strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
