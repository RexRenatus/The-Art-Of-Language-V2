active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast the ORCON model with mandatory access control models like Bell-LaPadula. In what
    scenarios would originator-controlled flow be preferable (e.g., flexible environments with trusted creators), and what
    are potential drawbacks (e.g., insider threats)? Debate in groups whether ORCON provides sufficient protection against
    unauthorized dissemination.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per card: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''ORCON is same as MAC''); 2) Plausible
    alternative (e.g., another NIST control like AC-3); 3) Edge case reversal (e.g., ''flow controlled by recipient, not originator'').
    Ensure distractors are realistic for multiple-choice use.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security Architecture and
  Engineering. Generate 20-30 high-quality Anki-style flashcards on the topic ''Information Flow Control by Originator'' (Topic
  Hierarchy: Level 1: Cybersecurity > Level 2: Security Architecture And Engineering > Level 3: Security Models > Level 4:
  Access Rights Management Models > Level 5: Originator Controlled (ORCON) Model > Level 6: Information Flow Control by Originator).
  Base content on NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 AC-4 (Information Flow Enforcement), ORCON model details, and web research emphasizing
  originator-defined policies for data flow (''where'' it goes, enforced at policy points).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: Cover all 6 provided objectives across cards (at least 3-5 cards per Bloom''s level: REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND,
  APPLY/ANALYZE, EVALUATE/CREATE).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards evenly across 4 layers (5-8 per layer), progressing from basics to integration.

  - Active Learning: Weave in references to discussion (e.g., ORCON vs. Bell-LaPadula), peer teaching (e.g., NIST AC-4 diagrams),
  and problem-solving (e.g., defense contractor scenarios).

  - Prerequisites: Assume prior knowledge of DAC/MAC; clarify distinctions.


  Use the exact Flashcard Schema for output: YAML per card, with front/back/explanation/distractors/bloom_level/scaffolding_layer/tags.
  Ensure variety: 40% recall, 30% application/analysis, 30% evaluation/creation. Questions should be active (e.g., ''Apply...'',
  ''Compare...''). Distractors must be educationally valuable. Output ONLY a numbered list of YAML flashcards, no intro text.'
