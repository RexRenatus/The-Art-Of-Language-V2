active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a Zero Trust Architecture, how does resource portal-based deployment enhance or challenge continuous
    verification of access? Debate the trade-offs between user convenience and security in real-world SaaS environments, using
    NIST SP 800-207 as reference. Connect to prior knowledge by contrasting with traditional perimeter security models from
    earlier Security Models curriculum.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per card: 1) Semantic trap (similar term, e.g., ''perimeter trust'' instead
    of zero trust); 2) Partial truth (e.g., mentions MFA but omits continuous verification); 3) Extreme/oversimplified (e.g.,
    ''eliminates all risks'' vs. risk-managed). Ensure plausibility from common errors in traditional models or incomplete
    ZTA understanding.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Generate
  25 high-quality flashcards on ''Resource Portal-Based Deployment'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture
  And Engineering > Security Models > Trust Models > Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) > Resource Portal-Based Deployment). Position
  as one ZTA deployment strategy (e.g., alongside browser-based) for secure architecture mastery.


  Incorporate:

  - Research Context: Resource Portal = web gateway for resources/apps/services; Deployment = centralized cloud/SaaS/PaaS
  access. ZTA (NIST SP 800-207): No implicit trust, continuous explicit verification. NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5: Controls (AC-2,
  IA-2 for access/auth); NIST CSF 2.0 (risk mgmt); RMF (structured process). Best practices: MFA, least privilege, logging/monitoring.

  - Active Learning: Use for context (e.g., debate trade-offs, scenarios).

  - Concept Map: Central ZTA → Deployment Models → Resource Portal-Based.


  Use exact Flashcard Schema: For each card, output JSON array of objects with ''front'', ''back'' (incl. answer, explanation
  w/ refs/Bloom/layer, 3 distractors A/B/C/D marked, references). Balance across levels/layers. Ensure pedagogical depth,
  active recall, distractors per protocol. Output only valid JSON array.'
