active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using low vs. high FAL in a multi-cloud federation for
    a financial institution. Consider risks like assertion replay attacks and benefits like reduced password fatigue, referencing
    NIST SP 800-63B/C and real-world examples like Azure AD.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
