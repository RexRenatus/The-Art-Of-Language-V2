active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a corporate environment, should trust anchors be managed centrally or distributed across devices?
    Debate the security, manageability, and compliance trade-offs, using examples from RFC 6024 and real-world breaches like
    DigiNotar. Consider misconceptions such as assuming trust anchors are always globally trusted root CAs.
  peer_teaching: Pair students; Student A explains trust anchor stores, managers, and certification paths to Student B using
    a hand-drawn diagram. Student B then teaches back using a non-example (e.g., an invalid certificate chain). Switch roles
    to reinforce understanding and address misconceptions about universal trust anchor significance.
  problem_solving: 'Provide a scenario: An IoT deployment has misconfigured trust anchors, leading to MITM attacks. Students
    design a compliant configuration per RFC 6024, validate a sample certificate chain using tools like OpenSSL, and propose
    automation via a Trust Anchor Manager. Discuss risks of misconfiguration like rogue CAs.'

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (3-4 options): 1 correct, others plausible from misconceptions (e.g., ''Trust anchors are
    always globally trusted root CAs'' vs. ''local significance''; confuse TA Store with CA; overlook constraints; mix with
    web-of-trust). Base on voter-noted errors like universal significance or ignoring RFC ops.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in PKI Trust Models. Topic:
  Trust Anchor Configuration (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Security Models > Trust Models
  > PKI Trust Models > Trust Anchor Configuration).


  Core Content (Web Research Summary): Trust Anchor (TA): Authoritative entity public key + constraints for signature verification;
  local to relying parties (RPs). TA Store: Collection of TAs on device. TA Manager: Manages store (RFC 6024 TAMP ops: add/list/delete).
  PKI: System for certs/keys; chains end at TA. Sources: RFC 6024 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6024), NIST SP
  800-32 PKI.


  Big Picture: TAs foundational to PKI for secure auth; misconfigs enable rogue CAs/MITM.
