active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using domain labels in Type Enforcement models (e.g.,
    SELinux) versus role-based access control (RBAC) for confining processes. Provide examples of scenarios where one outperforms
    the other and justify your position with TE-specific rules like domain transitions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs, create 3 distractors: 1 common misconception (e.g., confuse TE domains with Bell-LaPadula
    levels), 1 plausible but incorrect TE example (e.g., wrong SELinux domain like ''user_t'' for httpd), 1 edge case (e.g.,
    RBAC role instead of domain). Ensure distractors teach by contrast in explanations.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security Architecture and
  Engineering. Topic: ''Domain Labels for Subjects'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Security
  Models > Domain and Type Enforcement Models > Type Enforcement (TE) > Domain Labels for Subjects). Focus on TE specifics
  (SELinux/Flask examples like ''httpd_t'', domain transitions), per voter priorities: completeness on TE over truncated Clark-Wilson/Bell-LaPadula;
  accuracy distinguishing TE domains from MAC levels.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the array above]. Cover all, balance flashcards (e.g., 8-10 per objective).

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste the array above]. Distribute evenly (10 cards/layer).

  - Active Learning: Weave in hooks (e.g., ''Apply via problem-solving: ...'').


  Generate flashcards using this schema: [paste flashcard_schema above]. Ensure high pedagogy: Bloom''s progression, active
  recall, spaced repetition friendly. Use web-grounded examples (subjects=processes, domain labels=TE types for confinement).
  Output ONLY a JSON array of objects matching the schema structure. No extra text.'
