active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate whether SELinux security contexts provide sufficient granularity for modern cloud environments
    (e.g., Kubernetes pods) compared to traditional RBAC. Provide examples of limitations (e.g., dynamic scaling) and enhancements
    (e.g., custom types or integration with AppArmor).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    non-SELinux definition (e.g., RBAC role as job function only), 3) Plausible but incorrect SELinux variant (e.g., wrong
    level syntax like ''level0''). Ensure distractors teach by contrast.'

  Incorporate these EXACT elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [REMEMBER: Define...], [UNDERSTAND: Explain...], etc. (use as tags).

  - Scaffolding: Layer 1 Foundation (MAC/TE basics), Layer 2 Components (User:Role:Type:Level details), Layer 3 Implementation
  (commands/examples), Layer 4 Integration (MLS/RBAC/custom).

  - Active Learning: Inspire questions from discussion (cloud granularity), peer teaching (ls -Z), problem-solving (web server
  scenario).

  - Big Picture: SELinux MAC via TE contexts confines processes, prevents zero-days; extends RBAC with mandatory labels.

  - Accuracy: SELinux-specific - User (e.g., user_u), Role (type allowances, e.g., user_r), Type (TE, e.g., httpd_t), Level
  (MLS/MCS, e.g., s0). Avoid generic defs.


  Follow Flashcard Schema:

  - Output 25 flashcards in JSON array: [{''front'': ''... (tag: Bloom_layer)'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''recall_prompt'': ''...'' }}]

  - Varied formats, distractors as specified.

  - Link to prior: Assume DAC/RBAC knowledge.

  - Include formative MCQs on misconceptions.
