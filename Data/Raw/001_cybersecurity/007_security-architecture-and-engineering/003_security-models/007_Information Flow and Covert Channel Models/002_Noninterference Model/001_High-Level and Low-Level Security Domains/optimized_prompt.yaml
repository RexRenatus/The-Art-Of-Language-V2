active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains noninterference using a simple program example (e.g., 'Does a high-level password
    input affect low-level screen output?'). Use pseudocode to demonstrate purging high inputs. Switch roles after 5 minutes
    and provide feedback.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: In a shared printer system across high (secret) and low (unclassified) domains, identify potential
    interference paths (e.g., job queues leaking timing info). Propose mitigations like rate limiting or domain separation,
    then role-play as a security auditor validating the fixes.'

  Security Domains.


  CRITICAL ACCURACY NOTE: High-level security domains = higher confidentiality levels (secret/top secret); low-level = lower
  (unclassified/public). Noninterference (Goguen-Meseguer) ensures high actions do not affect low observations (purge high
  inputs, low traces identical). AVOID misconceptions: NOT strategic/ERM vs. tactical/operational.
