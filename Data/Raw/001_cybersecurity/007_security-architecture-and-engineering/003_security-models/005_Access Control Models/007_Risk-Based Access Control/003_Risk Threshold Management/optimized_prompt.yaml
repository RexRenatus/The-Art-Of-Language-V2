  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per flashcard: 1 based on related terms (e.g., confuse appetite with
    threshold), 1 on frameworks (e.g., wrong NIST function), 1 on misconceptions (e.g., tolerance less specific than appetite).
    Ensure explanations educate on errors. Prioritize MCQ format for objectivity; vary with T/F or short answer as needed.'

  (Topic Hierarchy: Level1: Cybersecurity, Level2: Security Architecture And Engineering, Level3: Security Models, Level4:
  Access Control Models, Level5: Risk-Based Access Control, Level6: Risk Threshold Management). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s
  Taxonomy progression, active learning (discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving), 4-layer scaffolding (Foundation: definitions;
  Components: frameworks/relationships; Implementation: NIST RMF steps/examples; Integration: ERM/access control links).

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards STRICTLY adhering to this REQUIRED SCHEMA for each:

  {question, correct_answer, explanation, distractors: [{text, explanation}, ... (exactly 3)], bloom_level: [''remember'',''understand'',''apply'',''analyze'',''evaluate'',''create''],

  Incorporate: Definitions (threshold/appetite/tolerance), NIST CSF 2.0 (GV.RM), SP 800-37 Rev 2 (Prepare/Categorize/Monitor),
  examples (bank $1M, CVSS>7.0), concept map links, prior knowledge (Risk-Based Access Control), formative MCQs (e.g., ''What
  is risk threshold?''). Balance Bloom''s/layers. Distractors: Plausible, educational explanations. Output as JSON array of
  flashcards. Sources: NIST CSF 2.0, SP 800-37 Rev 2, ISO 27005.'
