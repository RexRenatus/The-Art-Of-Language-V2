active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the security trade-offs of OBAC versus centralized models like RBAC in a corporate environment.
    When might owner control lead to vulnerabilities, such as inconsistent policies or insider threats?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    like RBAC''), (2) Related but incorrect (e.g., swap DAC/ABAC traits), (3) Plausible extreme (e.g., ''Owners have unlimited
    power without attributes''). Base on research accuracy (e.g., avoid implying OBAC is a formal standard). Ensure 70% pass
    rate for educated users.'

  **Topic Context & Hierarchy:** Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Security Models > Access Control
  Models > Discretionary Access Control (DAC) > Owner-Based Access Control (OBAC). OBAC: Conceptual model (not widely standardized)
  where resource owners define/enforce policies using attributes (subjects/objects/environment). Closely tied to DAC (owner
  discretion) and ABAC subset (attribute-driven). Core: Resource owner, resource, policy, attributes. Examples: Unix chmod/chown/ACLs,
  Google Drive/AWS S3 sharing. Standards: NIST SP 800-162 (ABAC Guide). Trade-offs: Flexible but risks inconsistency/vulnerabilities.

  **Active Learning Ties:** Weave in prompts/exercises (e.g., cards prompting debate on OBAC vs. RBAC trade-offs, policy design
  for team repo, peer-teach Unix scenario).


  **Scaffolding Layers (10 cards/layer):** [Insert full descriptions from JSON above].


  **Flashcard Generation Rules:** Follow exact schema [Insert full schema from JSON above]. Ensure accuracy: OBAC under DAC
  hierarchy but ABAC-flavored; use research-grounded distractors. Output as markdown list: ### Card 1
