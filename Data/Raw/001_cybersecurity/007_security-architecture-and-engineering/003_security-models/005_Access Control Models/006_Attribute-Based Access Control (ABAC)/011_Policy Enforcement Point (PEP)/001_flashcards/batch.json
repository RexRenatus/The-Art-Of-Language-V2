        "core_logic": "PEPs are fundamental to Zero Trust because they enforce granular policies at the point of access, verifying every request based on dynamic attributes, thereby upholding the 'never trust, always verify' principle. This granular enforcement ensures that access is granted only when all conditions are met, regardless of the user's network position.",
