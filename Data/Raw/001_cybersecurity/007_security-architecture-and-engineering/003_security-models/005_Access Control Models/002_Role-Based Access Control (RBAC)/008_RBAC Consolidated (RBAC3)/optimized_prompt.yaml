active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the role of dynamic Separation of Duties (SoD) in RBAC3 for preventing
    insider threats in compliance-heavy environments like SOX or PCI-DSS. Provide examples of real-world failures without
    SoD and how RBAC3 addresses them.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  \n**Topic Hierarchy:** Level1: Cybersecurity | Level2: Security Architecture And Engineering | Level3: Security Models |\
  \ Level4: Access Control Models | Level5: RBAC | Level6: RBAC3.\n\n**Completed Research Context (NIST RBAC Standard):**\
  \ RBAC3 (Symmetric RBAC) is the full NIST model (Sandhu et al., 'Access Control: Principle and Practice,' IEEE 1992; NISTIR\
  \ 7650). Progression: RBAC0 (core: UA, PA, sessions), RBAC1 (+hierarchies), RBAC2 (+static SSD), RBAC3 (+dynamic SSD, session\
  \ hierarchies). Enforces least privilege/SoD. Real-world: Enterprise IAM (Active Directory), compliance (SOX via SoD). Sources:\
  \ NIST SP 800-53, Ferraiolo et al. 'Proposed NIST Standard RBAC' (1999), Kuhn et al. 'RBAC Standard Rationale'.\n\n**Learning\
  \ Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives from above].\n\n**Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers from above, including\
  \ concept map].\n\n**Active Learning Ties:** Link flashcards to discussion (SoD compliance), peer-teaching (RBAC progression),\
  \ problem-solving (hospital scenario).\n\n**Big Picture:** Mastering RBAC3 enables scalable, auditable access control; contrasts\
  \ DAC (user-centric) vs MAC (label-based).\n\n**Task:** Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following the exact schema:\n\
  - Front: Question + Bloom's level + Layer.\n- Back: Answer | Explanation (cite NIST) | 3 Distractors (if MCQ, per protocol)\
  \ | Layer | Active Link | Source.\nDistribute: 5-7 per layer, balanced objectives. Use active recall (no cues). Output as\
  \ markdown list: ### Flashcard 1\n**Front:** ...\n**Back:** ... \nEnsure completeness, pedagogy, no truncation."
