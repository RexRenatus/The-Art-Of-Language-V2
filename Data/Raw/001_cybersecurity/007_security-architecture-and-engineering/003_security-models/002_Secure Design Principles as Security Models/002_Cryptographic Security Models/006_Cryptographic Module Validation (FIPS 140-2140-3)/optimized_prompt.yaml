active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of implementing FIPS 140-4 (highest security level) versus
    Level 1 in a cloud-native federal system. Consider cost, performance, and risk reduction—provide evidence from NIST SPs
    and real-world compliance examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

- level: 1
  name: Layer 1
  focus: ''
  content: 'Define cryptographic module (hardware/software/firmware implementing crypto functions). Introduce CMVP (NIST/CCCS
    joint program). Prerequisites link: Crypto basics ensure modules protect data via validated algos. Security Levels overview
    (1: basic; 2: roles; 3: identity/tamper-evident; 4: tamper-resistant).'

  focus: ''
  content: 'FIPS 140-2 (legacy, retires 2026) vs. FIPS 140-3 (harmonized with ISO/IEC 19790:2012; testing via ISO/IEC 24759:2017
    and NIST DTR). Key differences: Stricter entropy/randomness (approved sources like DRBG, validated conditioning; no weak
    system RNG). Detail Levels 1-4 requirements (e.g., Level 1: functional; Level 4: environmental failure protection).'
- level: 3
  name: Layer 3
  focus: ''
  content: 'Step-by-step CMVP: 1) Vendor self-test; 2) Submit to NIST-accredited lab; 3) Lab tests per Implementation Guidance
    (IG), ISO 24759; 4) NIST review/certification. Examples: Entropy validation (post-compromise recovery, noise sources).
    Practical: Module testing labs, certificate lookup on NIST site.'

  focus: ''
  content: 'Link to cloud (e.g., HSMs in AWS/GCP), secure design (zero-trust via validated crypto), cross-domain (risk models
    in federal systems). Implications: Compliance mandates (e.g., FISMA); optimize entropy for IoT/high-scale. Create: Hypothesize
    module for hybrid cloud with Level 3 tamper protection.'
