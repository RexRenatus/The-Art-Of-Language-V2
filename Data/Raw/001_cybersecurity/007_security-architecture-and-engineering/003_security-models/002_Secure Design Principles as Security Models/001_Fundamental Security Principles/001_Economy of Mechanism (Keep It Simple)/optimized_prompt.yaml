active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent does the Economy of Mechanism principle apply to modern cloud-native applications with
    microservices? Compare a monolithic simple app versus a complex microservices setup prone to misconfigurations (e.g.,
    Capital One breach). Discuss trade-offs between scalability and security simplicity.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Complexity increases security' vs. simplicity).
    - 'Distractors: 1) Opposite principle (e.g., over-privilege), 2) Partial truth (e.g., ''Scalability requires complexity''),
      3) Unrelated/confused concept (e.g., ''Economy of Scale'' mistaken for mechanism).'
    - Ensure distractors are realistic errors from real-world breaches or novice mistakes.
    coverage: 'Balance: 40% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 30% APPLY/ANALYZE, 30% EVALUATE/CREATE.'

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE THE learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]

  - Active Learning: Use elements for contextual explanations (e.g., reference discussion in cards).

  - Scaffolding: [PASTE THE scaffolding ARRAY HERE]. Cards must map to layers.

  - Sources: Saltzer & Schroeder (1975) ''The Protection of Information in Computer Systems'' (https://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/protection/),
  CISSP Domain 3, OWASP Insecure Design (https://owasp.org/Top10/A04_2021-Insecure_Design/), Capital One Breach (2019).

  - Best Practices: Modular Design (small, single-responsibility modules), Use standard libraries, Minimize state.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following the exact schema: [PASTE THE flashcard_schema HERE]. Output ONLY a JSON array
  of flashcards, each as an object with ''type'', ''front'', ''back'' (nested object). Ensure variety (8 MCQ, 10 basic QA,
  7 cloze), full coverage of Bloom''s/objectives/layers, distractors per protocol. Prioritize active recall, university pedagogy.'
