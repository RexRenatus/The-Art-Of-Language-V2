active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a military network with security levels Unclassified, Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret, debate
    whether the Simple Security Property alone prevents all confidentiality breaches or if the *-Property is essential. Use
    case studies, such as a Secret-cleared analyst attempting to read a Top Secret file, to support arguments on model limitations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Core Content: Use the provided scaffolding layers for comprehensive coverage. Incorporate learning objectives, active learning
  examples (e.g., scenarios from problem-solving), standards (DoD 5200.28-STD, NIST SP 800-53 AC-3/AC-16: ''to enforce policies
  for access based on security attributes''), and real-world examples (military/hospital).


  Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE].

  Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM ABOVE].

  Active Learning Examples: Use discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving for scenario-based cards.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following this exact schema: Output ONLY a JSON array of objects, each: {''front'':
  ''Question text'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''Correct answer'', ''explanation'': ''Detailed explanation with layer/objective/source
  links'', ''bloom_level'': ''e.g., Apply'', ''layer'': ''e.g., Layer 3'', ''distractors'': [''Distractor 1'', ''Distractor
  2'', ''Distractor 3''] }}. For short answer cards, set distractors to [].


  Flashcard Guidelines:

  - Align to Bloom''s progression and scaffolding.

  - 40% remember/understand (Layer 1-2), 30% apply/analyze (Layer 3), 30% evaluate/create (Layer 4).

  - MCQs: 4 options total (1 correct in answer, 3 distractors); use distractor protocol.

  - Promote active recall: Questions like ''Does this violate?'', ''Design a matrix snippet'', ''Critique limitation''.

  - Include visuals: ASCII diagrams for lattices/matrices.

  - Ensure spaced repetition: Varied phrasing, no duplicates.


  Output ONLY the JSON array.'
