active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the risks of not implementing administrative role separation in a mid-sized company where one
    sysadmin handles user provisioning, approvals, and auditing. Propose alternatives (e.g., role-based access with NIST SC-2
    compliance) and debate trade-offs like operational efficiency versus security, addressing misconceptions such as 'SoD
    is only for financial transactions.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., SoD vs. Need-to-Know); 2) Partial truths (e.g., Least Privilege without separation); 3) Outdated/irrelevant standards
    (e.g., mix NIST 800-53 with 800-171 specifics). Ensure distractors test deeper understanding.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in CISSP Domain 3: Security
  Architecture and Engineering. Topic: Administrative Role Separation (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And
  Engineering > Security Models > Conflict of Interest and Commercial Models > Separation of Duties Models > Administrative
  Role Separation). Consensus-approved content (82.9%): Integrate all below for university-level pedagogy (Bloom''s Taxonomy,
  active learning, 4-layer scaffolding).


  **Core Content (Complete/Enhanced from NIST/Web Sources):**

  - **Definitions**: SoD: No single control over critical process. Least Privilege: Min access needed. Admin Func: Mgmt tasks
  (user acct, patching). User Func: Daily use.

  - **Standards**: NIST SP 800-53 Rev5 SC-2: ''Separate user/system mgmt functionality'' (Enh: a=org-defined separation; b=crypto
  duties). NIST SP 800-171 Rev2 3.1.12: ''Separate duties to reduce collusion/malevolence; enforce least priv for CUI.''

  - **Big Picture**: Prevents insider threats, scales secure systems (CISSP Dom3).

  - **Concept Map**: Central: Admin Role Sep → SoD (parent) → Least Priv (enforces) → NIST SC-2 → User/Admin split.

  - **Sources**: NIST 800-53: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final; 800-171: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/171/r2/upd1/final;
