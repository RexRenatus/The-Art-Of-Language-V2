        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly suggest CMMI dictates specific architecture patterns, acts as a vulnerability checklist, or relies solely on technology, all of which misrepresent its core focus on improving the underlying processes that govern security engineering.",
        "analogy": "CMMI's process improvement is like refining a manufacturing assembly line. Instead of just having good parts (security principles) or skilled workers (engineers), CMMI helps optimize the entire assembly line (process) to ensure every product (system) is built consistently and reliably secure."
