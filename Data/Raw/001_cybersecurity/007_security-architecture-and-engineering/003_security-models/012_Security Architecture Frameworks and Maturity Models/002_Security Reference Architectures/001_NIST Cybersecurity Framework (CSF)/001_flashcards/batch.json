        {
          "text": "A Current Profile lists all identified vulnerabilities, while a Target Profile lists all implemented controls.",

        {
          "text": "A Current Profile is for internal use, while a Target Profile is for external reporting to regulators.",

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The distinction between Current and Target Profiles is crucial for strategic planning because it allows organizations to identify gaps between their present capabilities and future goals, thereby enabling prioritized action plans to improve their cybersecurity posture, as outlined in NIST SP 1299.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly define the scope and purpose of Current and Target Profiles, misrepresenting their content, intended audience, or focus areas.",
        "analogy": "A Current Profile is like a snapshot of your current fitness level, while a Target Profile is your desired fitness goal; the gap analysis helps you plan your training to reach that goal."
