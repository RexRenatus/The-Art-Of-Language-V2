active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how failures in cross-abstraction security composition (e.g., Heartbleed
    bug propagating from low-level OpenSSL implementation to high-level application policies) could be mitigated using NIST
    SP 800-160 principles. Link to prior concepts like confidentiality models and SABSA abstraction layers. What synergies
    or conflicts arise?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (2) Common misconception (e.g., ''security composes additively without synergies''), (3) Partial truth (e.g., correct
    for one layer only). Ensure plausible for experts but revealable via explanation.'

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list from JSON]

  - Active Learning: Use elements to inspire scenario-based cards (e.g., discussion debates as analysis Qs).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [insert full scaffolding from JSON].

  - Sources: NIST SP 800-160 (Vols 1-5: Systems Security Engineering, model-based SSE), SP 800-37 (RMF), SABSA, ISO/IEC 27001;
  examples: Heartbleed.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly [insert full schema from JSON]. Output as JSON array of objects, each with ''front'' and
  ''back'' keys. Ensure university pedagogy: Bloom''s progression, active recall, misconception-busting distractors. Cards
  must be concise, evidence-based, and spaced-repetition optimized.'
