  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''UDIs represent a security weakness in the Clark-Wilson
    model because they can be freely modified.'' Use examples from real-world systems (e.g., web forms, logs) to support or
    refute, considering how TPs mitigate risks. Identify common misconceptions like confusing UDIs with insecure data.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Use common misconceptions: e.g., ''UDIs are unique device IDs from FDA'' or ''UDIs are always insecure/low-integrity
      data''.'
    - 'Partial truths: e.g., ''UDIs can be modified by TPs'' (wrong: TPs use UDIs to create CDIs).'
    - 'Confusions with similar concepts: Mix with Biba subjects/objects, Bell-LaPadula confidentiality.'
    - 'Edge cases: Overgeneralize (e.g., all logs are CDIs) or understate (e.g., ignore separation of duties).'
    - 'Balance: 3 distractors per MCQ, plausible for intermediate learners, 1 highly attractive based on FDA error.'
    quantity: 'Generate 20-30 cards: 40% basic Q&A (Remember/Understand), 30% Apply/Analyze MCQs, 30% Evaluate/Create scenarios.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in the Clark-Wilson integrity
  model. Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Security Models > Integrity Models > Clark-Wilson
  Model > Unconstrained Data Items (UDIs). UDIs are Unconstrained Data Items: data objects (e.g., user inputs, audit logs,
  temp files) whose integrity is NOT enforced by the model; they can be freely appended/modified without TPs, unlike CDIs
  (Constrained Data Items: critical data validated by IVPs). TPs convert UDIs to CDIs; enforce separation of duties. Sources:
  Clark-Wilson 1987, CISSP. Avoid FDA/medical device confusion.
