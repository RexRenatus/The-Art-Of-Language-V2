active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the effectiveness of Clark-Wilson Enforcement Rules (E1-E4) versus Bell-LaPadula's
    confidentiality-focused rules for modern financial applications. Provide evidence from real-world breaches (e.g., banking
    fraud) and propose hybrid improvements.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    principles: 'Create plausible distractors using: (1) Common misconceptions (e.g., attribute to NIST SP 800-53 or Biba
      Model); (2) Partial truths (e.g., swap E1/E2 details); (3) Confidentiality mix-ups (e.g., Bell-LaPadula rules); (4)
      Over-generalizations (e.g., ''all logging'' instead of TP-specific). Ensure distractors test deeper understanding.'
    examples:
    - 'For E1: Distractor - ''Validate user identity (confuses with E2)'''
    - 'For E3: Distractor - ''Enforce least privilege per Bell-LaPadula (wrong model)'''
system_prompt: 'You are an expert CISSP-aligned flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity integrity models. Generate
  high-quality MCQ flashcards for the topic ''Enforcement Rules (E1-E4)'' in the Clark-Wilson Integrity Model (Topic Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Security Models > Integrity Models > Clark-Wilson Model > Enforcement
  Rules E1-E4). Ignore NIST SP 800-53 attributions; focus exclusively on Clark-Wilson (1987).


  Key Definitions:

  - E1: System must validate each TP prior to execution.

  - E2: System must bind/authenticate users to IVPs before TP use.

  - E3: System enforces separation of duties (e.g., via TP/TP/TP triples).

  - E4: System generates/maintains audit logs for all TP executions.

  Prerequisites: CDIs (protected data), UDIs, TPs (certified transactions), IVPs (verification).
