active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'Think-pair-share: Discuss common misconceptions about executive summaries (e.g., making them too technical
    vs. strategic). Pair up to share examples from real-world cybersecurity reports and how NIST CSF Functions can address
    them.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards progressing through Bloom''s Taxonomy and scaffolding layers. Use the exact Flashcard
  Schema: JSON array of objects with ''front'', ''back'', ''type'' (''QA'' or ''MCQ''), ''explanation'', ''distractors'' (for
  MCQ). Ensure active learning integration (e.g., flashcards on role-play scenarios). Distractors must follow protocol. Output
  ONLY the JSON array of flashcards.'
