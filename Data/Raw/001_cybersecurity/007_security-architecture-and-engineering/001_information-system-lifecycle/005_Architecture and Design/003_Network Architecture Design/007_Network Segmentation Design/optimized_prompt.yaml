  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 2-3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''increases attack surface'' vs.
    reduces); 2) Confusable term (e.g., ''VLAN'' vs. ''microsegmentation''); 3) Extreme/overly simplistic (e.g., ''eliminates
    all breaches'' vs. ''limits impact''). Ensure plausible for intermediate learners.'

  Incorporate this research context: Network segmentation divides networks into isolated segments/subnets to limit breach
  impact, reduce attack surface, and control traffic. Key concepts: Macrosegmentation (large functional chunks, e.g., DMZ/prod);
  Microsegmentation (granular to workloads for ZTA); Trust Zones (firewall-defined, risk-based in ZTA); Policy-Controlled
  Access (dynamic via PEPs/PDPs on identity/context). Standards: NIST SP 800-207 (ZTA), SP 1800-35 (SDN for segmentation).
  Best practices: Assess assets, define segments, deploy (firewalls/SDN/VLANs), test. Benefits: Limits lateral movement in
  hybrid/cloud.


  Prior knowledge: Subnets, VLANs, firewalls, OSI model.

  Big picture: Design phase of lifecycle prevents breaches, enables ZTA mastery.
