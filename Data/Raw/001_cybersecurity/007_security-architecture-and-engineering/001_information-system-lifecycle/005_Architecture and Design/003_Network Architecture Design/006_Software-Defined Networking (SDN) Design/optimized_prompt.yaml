active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'Discuss the trade-offs of SDN''s centralization: How does it enhance cybersecurity automation (e.g.,
    dynamic policy enforcement) while introducing risks like single-point-of-failure attacks on the controller? Provide examples
    from real-world breaches.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

      but incorrect term (e.g., ''OSI Layer 7'' instead of control plane), 1 edge case reversal (e.g., ''data plane controls
      traffic'' instead of forwards). Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter suggestions and research (e.g., traditional
      network flaws).'
    variety: 50% MCQ, 30% cloze, 20% short answer. Balance across Bloom's levels and layers.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Software-Defined Networking
  (SDN) Design (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information System Lifecycle > Architecture
  and Design > Network Architecture Design > SDN Design). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning components,
  4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema to create 50 high-quality flashcards.


  Incorporate:

  - Voter consensus: Complete design principles/best practices (TLS for APIs/OpenFlow, controller segmentation/redundancy,
  anomaly detection). Link to prior knowledge (OSI model, traditional networks).

  - Research context: Control/data planes, SDN controller, NBAPIs/SBAPIs (e.g., OpenFlow), attack surfaces (examtopics.com).

  - Pedagogy: Objectives span Bloom''s (remember/understand/apply/analyze/evaluate/create). Embed active learning ties.


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"front": "Question text", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation":
  "... (include Bloom''s level, layer, distractor rationale if MCQ, source)", "active_learning_tie_in": "..."}}.


  Ensure completeness, scaffolding progression (Layer 1 foundation to Layer 4 integration), distractors per protocol, and
  cybersecurity focus (secure SDN design).'
