      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The primary goal of encryption for confidentiality is to prevent unauthorized disclosure. Therefore, selecting an algorithm that is mathematically robust and resistant to cryptanalysis, ensuring it can protect data even with large key sizes, is paramount.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors focus on secondary concerns like speed, legacy compatibility, or popularity, rather than the core security requirement of resistance to attacks that would compromise confidentiality.",
        "analogy": "When choosing a lock for a secure vault, the most important factor is its resistance to being picked or forced open (cryptanalysis). Speed of locking/unlocking or how common the lock is are secondary to its ability to keep the contents secret."
