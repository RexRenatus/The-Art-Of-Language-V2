active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent should Privacy by Design be mandatory in enterprise architecture? Debate using NIST Privacy
    Framework examples (e.g., Govern and Communicate functions), comparing it to traditional security-by-design approaches.
    Consider trade-offs with business agility, ethics, and integration challenges.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student teaches the partner the NIST Privacy Framework core functions (Identify-P, Govern,
    Control, Communicate) with real-world examples of data actions (e.g., collection in e-commerce); switch roles and use
    teach-back with quizzes on identifying problematic data actions and mitigations.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: An e-commerce platform is expanding to AI personalization, involving data collection, transformation,
    and sharing. Integrate privacy architecture into the system lifecycle: identify privacy risks, map to NIST Privacy Framework
    functions, propose mitigations, and create a simple diagram showing integration points.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university pedagogy (Bloom''s
  Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding) for optimal spaced repetition. Topic: Privacy Architecture Framework Integration
  (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information System Lifecycle > Architecture and Design
  > Enterprise Architecture Integration > Privacy Architecture Framework Integration). Use this research-grounded content:
  Core concepts (Privacy, Privacy Risk, Data Processing, Data Actions, Problematic Data Actions from NIST PF: https://www.nist.gov/privacy-framework/privacy-framework);
  NIST PF functions (Identify-P, Govern, Control, Communicate); Privacy by Design; Integration with TOGAF/system lifecycle;
  Examples (e-commerce AI); Sources (above + Privacy by Design: https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/Resources/7foundationalprinciples.pdf).
