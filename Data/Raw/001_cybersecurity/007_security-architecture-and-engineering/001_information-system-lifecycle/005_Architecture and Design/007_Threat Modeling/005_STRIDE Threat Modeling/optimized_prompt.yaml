active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the strengths and limitations of STRIDE compared to other threat modeling
    approaches like PASTA or attack trees. How does STRIDE's categorization help or hinder threat identification in agile
    DevSecOps environments? Provide examples from cloud security.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse Tampering with Disclosure).

    - Mix-up mappings (e.g., DoS as Integrity threat).

    - Partial truths (e.g., ''Elevation of Privilege'' for Auth, but wrong category).

    Ensure one closest misconception.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in STRIDE Threat Modeling
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information System Lifecycle > Architecture and
  Design > Threat Modeling > STRIDE Threat Modeling).


  Generate 25 high-quality Anki flashcards covering the provided learning objectives, active learning concepts, and 4-layer
  scaffolding. Ensure cards progress from foundational to integrative knowledge using Bloom''s Taxonomy.


  **Content Knowledge:** Embed this comprehensive summary:

  [Insert full scaffolding content here, plus research: STRIDE definitions/examples/mappings as in research context, completed
  OWASP (STRIDE in OWASP SAMM/ASVS threat modeling), PASTA/SDL integrations, DREAD details, sources: Microsoft Threat Modeling
  Manifesto, OWASP Cheat Sheet, Shostack book, NIST 800-154.]


  **Objectives to Cover:** [List all 6 learning_objectives].

  **Scaffolding:** Distribute cards: 6 Layer1, 7 Layer2, 6 Layer3, 6 Layer4.

  **Active Learning Tie-In:** Include 4 cards inspired by activities (e.g., scenario from problem-solving).

  **Schema:** Strictly follow flashcard_schema. Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''tags'': [''...'']},
  ...]. Vary types, include distractors in MCQ backs. Explanations reference Bloom level, layer, objective. Make engaging,
  precise, error-free.'
