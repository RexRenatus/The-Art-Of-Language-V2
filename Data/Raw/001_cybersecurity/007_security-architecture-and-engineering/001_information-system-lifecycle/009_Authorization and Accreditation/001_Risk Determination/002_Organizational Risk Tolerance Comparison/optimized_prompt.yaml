active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare the organizational risk tolerance of a high-risk industry like fintech startups (high tolerance
    for innovation risks) versus a low-risk sector like public utilities (low tolerance for operational disruptions). Debate
    how mission needs, culture, and regulations shape these differences, referencing NIST SP 800-39 and CSF 2.0 profiles.
    Support arguments with examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs: 1 correct answer; 3 distractors – 1 common misconception (e.g., ''risk tolerance is static''),
    1 related but incorrect term (e.g., ''risk appetite'' vs. tolerance), 1 extreme/plausible alternative (e.g., opposite
    industry tolerance). Ensure distractors are web/NIST-grounded but wrong in context.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  ''Organizational Risk Tolerance Comparison'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information
  System Lifecycle > Authorization and Accreditation > Risk Determination > Organizational Risk Tolerance Comparison). Use
  this comprehensive research summary: Organizational risk tolerance (NIST SP 800-39) is ''the level of risk organizations
  are willing to accept in pursuit of strategic goals,'' defined organization-wide for all missions/functions. Influences
  risk management entirely; shaped by senior leaders, culture, mission needs, risk type (e.g., higher for financial vs. cyber),
  external regs. Differs from system-level (bounded by org tolerance). NIST CSF 2.0 uses profiles for tiered implementation.
  Comparisons: High-tolerance (fintech: innovation risks) vs. low (utilities/healthcare: disruptions). Prior knowledge: risk/threat/vulnerability/likelihood/impact.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers [insert full scaffolding_layers]. Tag each: ''Layer X''.

  - Concept Map: Central ''Organizational Risk Tolerance'' → influencers (culture/mission/risk type/external), frameworks
  (NIST 800-39/CSF 2.0), dependencies (risk frame/prior basics), interconnections (to decisions/comparisons/org-system levels).

  (industries/org-system), full NIST details, voter priorities. High-quality, engaging, misconception-busting. Vary difficulty
  progressively.'
