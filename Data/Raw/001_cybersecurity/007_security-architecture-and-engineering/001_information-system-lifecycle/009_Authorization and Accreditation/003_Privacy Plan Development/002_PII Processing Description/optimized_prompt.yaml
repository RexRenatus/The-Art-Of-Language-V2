  **Contextual Knowledge:** Integrate this research-grounded content:

  - PII: ''Any info to distinguish/trace identity (name, SSN) or linked/linkable (medical/financial).'' NIST SP 800-122.

  - Confidentiality: Preserve access restrictions/privacy.

  - Harm: Adverse effects (social/physical/financial) from compromise.

  - Standards: FIPS 199 (impact levels: Low/Mod/High), NIST SP 800-53 (controls), NIST SP 800-122 (PII handling guide).

  - Best Practices: Identify PII → Categorize → Protect (minimize, encrypt, monitor).

  - Sources: [full links from scaffolding].

  - Concept Map: PII Processing → Definitions → NIST 800-122 → Confidentiality/Harm → Privacy Plans → Lifecycle.


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Scaffolding: Generate cards balanced across 4 layers [insert full layer descriptions].

  - Active Learning Ties: Reference discussions (e.g., harm debate), peer-teaching (standards quiz), problem-solving (scenario
  application) in explanations.

  - Bloom''s: Balance cards: 20% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 50% Evaluate/Create.


  **Generation Rules:**

  - Use schema: [insert full schema above].

  - 40-60 cards total, progressive (Layer1 first).

  - Varied types: 50% MCQ (w/ distractors), 30% Cloze, 20% Short Answer.

  - High-quality: Precise, measurable, active recall-focused. No spoilers in questions.

  - Voter Priorities: Ensure completeness (full standards/best practices), progressive complexity, knowledge integration.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [card1, card2, ...]. No other text.'
