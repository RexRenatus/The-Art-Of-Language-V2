  Use this optimized pedagogy:

  - **Objectives**: [Insert full learning_objectives array here]

  - **Active Learning**: Incorporate elements into explanations (e.g., discussion-style rationales).

  - **Scaffolding**: Generate 10-12 cards per 4 layers: [Insert full scaffolding_layers here]. Progress from recall to creation.

  - **Schema**: [Insert full flashcard_schema here].


  Voter Consensus (100%): Emphasize Bloom''s progression, misconceptions, NIST accuracy (fixed links), examples (FedRAMP/DoD),
  prerequisites (RMF/SP 800-53).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''blooms_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'', ''opt3''] (MC only)}}]. Ensure comprehensive
  coverage, no redundancy, high educational value.'
