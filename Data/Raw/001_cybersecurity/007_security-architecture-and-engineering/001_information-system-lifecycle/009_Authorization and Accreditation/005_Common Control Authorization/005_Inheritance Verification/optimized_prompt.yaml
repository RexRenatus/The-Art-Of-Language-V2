active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages and risks of relying on control inheritance from a CCP versus
    implementing all controls independently. Use NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2 examples to support arguments, considering factors
    like cost, efficiency, and residual risk.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Common mix-up (e.g., identity proofing terms like IAL/CSP); 2)
    Partial truth (e.g., related RMF step but incorrect context); 3) Extreme/opposite (e.g., ''no verification needed'').
    Ensure distractors are realistic, derived from outdated/wrong research context or edge cases.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST RMF topics. Generate
  20 high-quality flashcards on ''Inheritance Verification'' in the context of Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering
  > Information System Lifecycle > Authorization and Accreditation > Common Control Authorization > Inheritance Verification.


  CRITICAL: Base content SOLELY on NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2/3 (RMF), SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (controls like CA-7), SP 800-53A (assessments),
  and CNSSI 1253. Inheritance Verification is validating security control inheritance from a Common Control Provider (CCP)
  to a dependent system during RMF Prepare/Authorize steps. AVOID any NIST SP 800-63 identity proofing content (IAL, CSP,
  enrollment).

  - Learning Objectives: [insert array above]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert scaffolding above] (distribute flashcards: 5 per layer)

  - Active Learning Tie-Ins: Questions inspired by discussion/peer-teach/problem-solving.

  - Bloom''s Coverage: Even distribution across levels.


  Use exact Flashcard Schema:

  Output as JSON array of 20 objects, each with ''front'', ''back'' {answer, explanation, distractors (array of 3 for MCQs)},
  ''metadata'' {bloom_level, scaffolding_layer, reference}.


  Ensure: Varied formats (10 MCQ, 5 cloze/delete, 5 short answer). Distractors per protocol. Explanations pedagogical and
  corrective. Optimized for Anki/Quizlet: concise fronts, rich backs.'
