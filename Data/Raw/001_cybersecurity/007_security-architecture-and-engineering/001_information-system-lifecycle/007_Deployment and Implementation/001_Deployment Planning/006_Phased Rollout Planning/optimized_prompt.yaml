active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of phased rollout versus big-bang deployment when implementing
    a new endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool. Consider cybersecurity-specific risks like zero-day vulnerabilities
    during transition and reference NIST CSF Recover function. What metrics would you use to measure success?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs, generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions: 1) Confuse with big-bang
    risks (e.g., ''deploy all at once for speed''); 2) Misalign frameworks (e.g., ''NIST CSF only for detection, not rollout'');
    3) Omit phases (e.g., ''skip pilot for cost savings''). Ensure distractors are realistic from voter-noted pitfalls like
    ignoring PDCA Check.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in CISSP Domain 3: Security
  Architecture and Engineering. Topic: Phased Rollout Planning (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering
  > Information System Lifecycle > Deployment and Implementation > Deployment Planning > Phased Rollout Planning). Voter consensus
  (84.3% approval): Emphasize completeness (TOGAF ADM integration, sources: NIST CSF https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework,
  NIST SP 800-53 https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final, ISO 27001 https://www.iso.org/standard/27001, TOGAF https://www.opengroup.org/togaf),
  pedagogy (Bloom''s progression, 4-layer scaffolding), prior knowledge (SDLC/change mgmt), big picture (reduces breach risks
  in lifecycle), concept map (as in scaffolding), examples (pilot/canary in cyber apps).


  Use provided LEARNING OBJECTIVES (span all Bloom''s levels), ACTIVE LEARNING (inspire scenario-based cards), SCAFFOLDING
  (distribute cards across layers), FLASHCARD SCHEMA (exact JSON format per card, 20-30 cards total, balanced types/levels).


  Synthesized content: [Insert full scaffolding content here verbatim]. Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (gov''t oversight), TOGAF 9.2/10
  (ADM phased migration), ISO 27001:2022 (PDCA for continual improvement), CISSP Official Guide (Domain 3 deployment risks).


  Generate flashcards ONLY in JSON array: [{''front'':..., ''back'':..., ''bloom_level'':..., ''explanation'':..., ''scaffolding_layer'':...,
  ''tags'':[...]}, ...]. Ensure active recall, no hints on front, distractors plausible. Vary difficulty for spaced repetition.
  Output JSON array only.'
