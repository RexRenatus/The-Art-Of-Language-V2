active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare SAST with DAST. When would you integrate SAST early in the SDLC versus later stages? Discuss
    trade-offs in a DevSecOps context, including false positives, coverage gaps, and remediation costs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    of static analysis), (2) Confusable term (e.g., DAST traits), (3) Partial truth (e.g., ''Detects only runtime issues'').
    Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter-noted limitations/false positives.'

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema: {''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''distractors'':
  [...], ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...''}}


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full list from above]

  - Active Learning: Embed concepts from discussion (SAST vs DAST trade-offs), peer teaching (process/misconceptions), problem-solving
  (code vulns/fixes).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute across 4 layers + prior knowledge [paste full scaffolding from above].

  - Prioritize Bloom''s progression: Scaffold from lower to higher cognition.

  - Research Context: White-box, no-execution analysis of source/byte/binary code; detects SQL/command injections; DevSecOps/SDLC
  integration; limitations (false positives, runtime misses); standards (OWASP Top 10, NIST SSDF, CWE, CIS).


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly [paste full schema from above]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, e.g., [flashcard1,
  flashcard2, ...]. Ensure variety: 40% MCQ, 60% open recall/cloze. Make explanations educational, tying to real-world DevSecOps.'
