active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of NIST SP 800-161r1, debate whether integration testing alone is sufficient to mitigate
    supply chain risks in system components, or if additional C-SCRM practices are necessary. Provide examples of risks that
    emerge only at integration (e.g., counterfeit components or configuration mismatches) and counterarguments based on real-world
    breaches.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives [insert learning_objectives array here], active learning [insert
  active_learning object here], 4-layer scaffolding [insert scaffolding object here]. Ensure big-picture context: Role in
  SDLC for supply chain risk mitigation (NIST SP 800-161r1), preventing interface vulnerabilities.


  Sources: NIST SP 800-161r1 (Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management), SP 800-160 Vol. 1 & 2 (Systems Security Engineering:
  secure integration processes), SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (SA-11 Developer Testing, IN-2 Integration Plan). Real-world: IoT/supply
  chain attacks.


  Follow flashcard_schema exactly: Output as JSON array of objects, each with ''front'', ''back'' (containing ''answer'',
  ''explanation'', ''distractors'' array if MC, ''bloom_level'', ''references'', ''layer'', ''active_learning_link''). Balance:
