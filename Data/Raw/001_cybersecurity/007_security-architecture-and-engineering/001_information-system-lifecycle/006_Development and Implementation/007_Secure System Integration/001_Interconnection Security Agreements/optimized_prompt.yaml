active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios would an Interconnection Security Agreement (ISA) be more critical than a Memorandum
    of Understanding (MOU), and why? Debate using real-world examples like cloud service interconnections, supply chain partnerships,
    or critical infrastructure links (e.g., under NERC CIP). Consider factors such as data sensitivity, regulatory compliance,
    and risk levels.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Use similar terms (e.g., MOU/A as distractor for ISA)
    - Partial truths (e.g., 'ISA only covers business terms' – confuses with MOU)
    - Opposites (e.g., 'No need for encryption in ISAs')
    - Common misconceptions (e.g., 'NERC CIP-005 applies only to physical perimeters')
    - Irrelevant details (e.g., SLA metrics for ISA question)
    - Ensure 1 correct, 3 plausible distractors balanced across layers/objectives

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving (e.g., scenario-based Qs).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers [INSERT FULL LAYERS FROM ABOVE]. Tag each with layer and Bloom''s level.

  - Prior Knowledge: Assume CIA triad, network basics.

  - Standards: NIST SP 800-47 Rev. 1 (lifecycle: Planning, Establishing, Maintaining, Disconnecting); NERC CIP-003-9 (security
  mgmt), CIP-005-7 (electronic perimeters, remote access).

  - Concept Map Integration: Questions on relationships (ISA → phases → controls → standards).

  - Sources: NIST SP 800-47 Rev. 1 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-47r1.pdf); NERC CIP
  Standards (https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Pages/CIPStandards.aspx).


  Generate 25-35 flashcards per EXACT schema [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD_SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Ensure high pedagogical value: active
  recall, spaced repetition friendly, distractors from protocol. Output ONLY a JSON array: [{''id'':1, ''type'':''multiple_choice'',
  ''front'':''...'', ''back'':{...}, ''tags'':[''layer:1'',''bloom:remember'']}, ...]. No extra text.'
