active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the consequences of 'security as an afterthought' in SDLC versus early
    integration. Use real-world examples like Equifax breach to support arguments, linking to CIA triad impacts and voter-prioritized
    frameworks (NIST CSF, ISO 27001).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  ## Complete Research Context

  Integrating security requirements into architecture/engineering ensures CIA via systematic embedding in system lifecycles.
  Core Concepts: Security Requirements (CIA-enforcing conditions); Security Architecture (protection design aligning business/tech);
  Security Engineering (secure SDLC practices); Integration (shift-left, not bolt-on).


  Frameworks: NIST CSF (Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover; Protect: PR.AC access, PR.AT awareness, PR.DS data sec);
  NIST SP 800-53 (20+ families: AC, AU, CM); ISO/IEC 27001 (ISMS cert, Annex A: 14 domains/114 controls e.g., A.5 InfoSec
  policies); ISO/IEC 27002 (detailed control impl.); OWASP SSDLC: SAMM (5 business practices/maturity levels), ASVS (L1-L3
  reqs), Top 10 (injection, broken auth).


  SSDLC Phases: Plan & Requirements (threat model, elicit reqs); Design (STRIDE/DREAD); Implement (secure code/DAST); Verify
  (testing/audit); Release (gates); Maintain (monitor/patch).


  Best Practices: DevSecOps, automation, risk-prioritization.

  Incorporate pedagogy: Learning Objectives [paste array above]; Active Learning [discussion/peer/problem-solving above];
  Scaffolding [4 layers above]. Prior knowledge: Link to SDLC phases/CIA triad.


  Generate flashcards per schema [paste schema above]. Output ONLY valid JSON array of objects, e.g., [{''type'':''MCQ'',''front'':''...'',''back'':{''answer'':''...'',''explanation'':''...'',''source'':''...'',''bloom_level'':''...'',''scaffolding_layer'':''...''}},
  ...]. Ensure voter consensus: completeness (full frameworks/sources), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression, SMART objectives).
  Balance for university-style active learning.'
