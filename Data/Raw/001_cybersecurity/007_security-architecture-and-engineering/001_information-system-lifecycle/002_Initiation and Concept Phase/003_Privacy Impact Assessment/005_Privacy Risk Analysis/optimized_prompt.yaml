active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between maximizing data utility (e.g., personalized advertising
    on social media) and minimizing privacy risks (e.g., unauthorized sharing leading to stigma or economic loss). Use real-world
    examples like the Cambridge Analytica scandal and reference NIST Privacy Framework functions to support arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    for privacy risks). 2) Confusable term (e.g., ''Security Risk'' vs. ''Privacy Risk''). 3) Partial truth (e.g., ''Collection
    only'' for Data Actions). Ensure distractors promote active recall and error correction. Balance coverage: 40% Foundation,
    30% Components/Implementation, 30% Integration.'

  \ Phase**, **Entry Subdomain: Privacy Impact Assessment**. Use **exact topic_hierarchy**: Level 1: Cybersecurity > Level\
  \ 2: Security Architecture And Engineering > Level 3: Information System Lifecycle > Level 4: Initiation and Concept Phase\
  \ > Level 5: Privacy Impact Assessment > Level 6: Privacy Risk Analysis in EVERY flashcard explanation.\n\n**Content Foundation**:\
  \ Integrate research: Privacy Risk (likelihood/impact of data processing problems); Data Action (collect/retain/share/etc.);\
  \ Problematic Data Action; Privacy Event; Privacy Impact (dignity/economic harm); Organizational Impact (fines/reputation).\
  \ NIST Privacy Framework: Core Functions (Govern-P, Identify-P, Control-P, Communicate-P, Protect-P); Profiles (gap analysis/prioritization).\
  \ Concept Map: Central Privacy Risk Analysis → Data Actions → Problematic → Events → Impacts → NIST Functions. Examples:\
  \ Data breach → identity theft. Misconceptions: Privacy only breaches.\n\n**Pedagogy**: Align to Bloom's objectives [list\
  \ all 6 from above]. Scaffolding: 4 layers [insert full scaffolding details]. Prerequisites: Builds on risk assessment/data\
  \ lifecycle.\n\n**Active Learning Tie-in**: Flashcards should prompt recall for activities like scenario analysis.\n\n**Output\
