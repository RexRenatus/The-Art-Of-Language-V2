  discussion_prompt: 'Discuss: ''Version control is often misunderstood as only applying to code, not security documentation.
    How does applying version control to documents like policies and baselines enhance traceability in C-SCRM, and what risks
    arise from neglecting it? Link to your prior knowledge of SDLC phases.'' (Encourages critical thinking and addresses common
    misconceptions.)'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Version control only for code'').

    - Partial truths (e.g., mix baseline with final config).

    - Irrelevant NIST controls (e.g., confuse CM-3 with AC-3).

    - Edge cases (e.g., ignore C-SCRM integration).

    Ensure distractors are plausible for mid-level learners.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Create 40-50 high-quality flashcards on
  ''Document Version Control'' using the provided structure, schema, learning objectives, active learning components, and
  4-layer scaffolding. Ensure progression through Bloom''s Taxonomy (at least 1-2 per level). Incorporate voter consensus:
  full NIST SP 800-161r1 coverage (CM-3: config change control, enhancements prohibit unauthorized changes, C-SCRM assessments);
  textual concept map in explanations; prior knowledge links to SDLC; misconceptions for distractors.


  **Context**: Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity (L1) > Security Architecture And Engineering (L2) > Information System Lifecycle

  800-161r1-upd1, SP 800-171r3, SP 800-53 Rev 5.


  Use exact scaffolding layers, objectives, active learning for inspiration (e.g., weave discussion scenarios into problems).

  Balance: 25% Layer 1-2 (lower Bloom''s), 50% Layer 3 (apply/analyze), 25% Layer 4 (evaluate/create). Distractors per protocol.
  Make engaging, precise, and pedagogically optimized.'
