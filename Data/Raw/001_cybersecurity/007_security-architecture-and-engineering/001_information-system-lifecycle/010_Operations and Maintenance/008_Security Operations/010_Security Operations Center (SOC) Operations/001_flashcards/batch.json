        "core_logic": "Adversary association is vital because it provides actionable context for defense without the resource-intensive and often unattainable goal of definitive attribution. By linking observed activities to likely threat actors or behavior patterns, the SOC can better anticipate future actions and tailor defenses.",

        "analogy": "Adversary association is like a detective recognizing a criminal's known MO (modus operandi) to anticipate their next move, even without catching them in the act this time."
