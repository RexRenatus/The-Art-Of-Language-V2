active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the risks of delaying authorization termination during a cloud migration scenario. What real-world
    breaches, such as the Capital One incident, illustrate the consequences of failing to revoke authorizations for decommissioned
    systems? Consider impacts on zero-trust architecture and regulatory compliance.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one learner explains Authorization Termination versus Authorization Rescission using examples from
    NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2 (e.g., termination at expiration date vs. rescission due to a security incident). Switch roles and
    conduct a teach-back with peer feedback on accuracy.
  problem_solving: In small groups, develop a decommissioning checklist for a legacy on-premises system migrating to cloud,
    incorporating RMF termination steps. Include risk assessment for incomplete termination. Peer-review each other's checklists
    against NIST guidelines and present optimizations.

    ''Rescission = natural expiration''); 2) Related terms (ATO/ATU/Denial as swaps); 3) Partial truths (e.g., ''Termination
    only for cloud systems''); 4) Real-world inversions (e.g., Capital One as ''success story''). Ensure 1-2 high-plausibility
    distractors per MCQ to test analysis.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Authorization Termination''
  (Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information System Lifecycle > System Disposal and Retirement >
  System Decommissioning > Authorization Termination). Consensus: 82.9% approval.


  **Content Sources:** NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2 RMF: Formal revocation/end of ATO/ATU at lifecycle end, termination date, vs.
  rescission (incident), denial. Prevents zombie systems/data leaks. Links: System disposal (sanitization), Monitor step triggers,
  FedRAMP, zero-trust.
