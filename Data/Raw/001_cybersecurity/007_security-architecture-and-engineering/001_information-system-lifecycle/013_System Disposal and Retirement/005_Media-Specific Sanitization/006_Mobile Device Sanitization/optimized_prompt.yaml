  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Factory reset is sufficient for sanitizing mobile devices
    with sensitive data in all scenarios.'' Use NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1 to support arguments, addressing common misconceptions
    like data recoverability via forensic tools, and propose alternatives for high-confidentiality data.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 1. Use common misconceptions (e.g., factory reset erases all). 2. Partial truths (e.g., 'Clear for
    high-security' - wrong level). 3. Confusable terms (Purge vs. Clear). 4. Outdated info (e.g., reference non-existent Rev.
    2). Ensure 60% MCQ.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on
  ''Mobile Device Sanitization'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture & Engineering > Information System Lifecycle
  > System Disposal & Retirement > Media-Specific Sanitization > Mobile Device Sanitization). Use NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1 (current,
  https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/88/r1/final) and SP 800-124 Rev. 2 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/124/r2/final) as
  primary sources. Incorporate provided scaffolding (4 layers), common misconceptions for distractors, concept map dependencies,
  and prior knowledge links.


  Learning Objectives: [Insert full learning_objectives array here].

  Active Learning: Use scenarios from [discussion_prompt, peer_teaching_activity, problem_solving_exercise] for applied cards.


  Follow EXACT flashcard_schema: JSON array of objects with bloom_level (balanced across levels), question_type (60% mcq),
  question, answer, distractors (3 for mcq, plausible via distractor_protocol), explanation (detailed, with refs), tags.


  Scaffold progression: 5 cards Layer 1 (remember/understand), 7 Layer 2 (understand/analyze), 7 Layer 3 (apply), 6 Layer
  4 (evaluate/create). Ensure active learning tie-ins, measurable outcomes alignment, and university pedagogy (e.g., higher-order
  in explanations). Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards.'
