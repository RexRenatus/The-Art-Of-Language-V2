NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 2 recommends verification after degaussing to ensure effectiveness. Overwriting with a single pass is a 'clear' method, potentially insufficient. Shredding is 'destroy' and prevents reuse. CE is for encrypted media, not directly for sanitizing the magnetic state of an unencrypted HDD.",

Degaussing is like using a powerful magnet to scramble the writing so it's unreadable, and you can still use the whiteboard. Shredding is like tearing the whiteboard into tiny pieces. Overwriting is like writing over it, but maybe some faint traces remain. CE is like having a special lock on the whiteboard that you can break."
