active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a rapidly evolving threat landscape, debate whether NIST CSF 2.0's GOVERN (GV.OV) and IDENTIFY (ID.IM)
    functions adequately support real-time risk mitigation progress monitoring compared to RMF's continuous monitoring (Step
    6)—provide evidence from case studies like the Equifax breach.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains risk mitigation strategies (avoid/transfer/mitigate/accept) and progress metrics
    (e.g., KPIs like MTTR, trends); the partner teaches back using a custom example from their prior knowledge of risk identification
    or security controls.
  problem_solving: 'Analyze the Log4j vulnerability remediation scenario: Design a monitoring dashboard tracking KPIs (e.g.,
    MTTR, risk reduction rate), predict potential failure points, and simulate a CISO review meeting or agile sprint retrospective.'

  **Context and Research (complete, web-grounded):** Effective risk mitigation progress monitoring tracks mitigation strategies
  (avoid/transfer/mitigate/accept) via KPIs (MTTR, risk reduction rate), tools (dashboards, GRC), in NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2
  (RMF Step 6: Monitor security controls/risks continuously, DE.CM), NIST CSF 2.0 (GV.OV: Oversight, ID.IM: Risk management
  strategy). Other: CIS Controls v8 #7 Continuous Monitoring, ISO 27001 A.12.7 Audit. Big picture: Proactive posture, FISMA
  compliance, SOC/audit use, zero-trust/AI integration. Sources: NIST SP 800-37r2 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-37r2.pdf),
  CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/framework), CIS (https://www.cisecurity.org/controls).


  **Prior Knowledge:** Risk identification, security controls implementation, continuous monitoring basics.


  **Concept Map:** Central ''Risk Mitigation Progress Monitoring'' → ''Metrics/KPIs'' (MTTR), ''Tools/Dashboards'', ''Standards
  (RMF/CSF)'' → Links to ''Lifecycle'' → ''Reporting/Adjustment''.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the ''learning_objectives'' array here].


  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Weave in discussion (CSF vs RMF debate, Equifax), peer teaching (strategies/metrics), problem-solving
  (Log4j dashboard) for explanations.


  **Scaffolding:** [Insert the ''scaffolding'' object here]. Balance flashcards across layers.


  **Generation Instructions:** Use the ''flashcard_schema'' exactly. Ensure variety (60% multiple_choice with 4 options incl.
  correct + 3 distractors; 40% cloze). Explanations: 2-4 sentences, reference objective/layer/active learning/source. Cover
  misconceptions (e.g., monitoring ≠ alerts). Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcards, no additional text.'
