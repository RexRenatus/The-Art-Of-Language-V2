active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a resource-constrained environment, should organizations prioritize vulnerabilities based solely on
    CVSS scores or incorporate business impact and exploitability? Debate with real-world examples like Log4Shell, considering
    trade-offs in remediation timelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
