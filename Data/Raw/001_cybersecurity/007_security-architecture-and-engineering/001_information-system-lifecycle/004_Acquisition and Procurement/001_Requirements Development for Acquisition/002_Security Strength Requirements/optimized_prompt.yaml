active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given limited budgets, debate whether organizations should prioritize maximum security strength or tailor
    it to risk assessments, using NIST SP 800-53 control families (e.g., AC for access control) as examples. Consider common
    misconceptions like assuming higher strength always equals better security without context, and reference threats/vulnerabilities/impacts.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Generate
  25 high-quality Anki-style flashcards on ''Security Strength Requirements'' (Topic Hierarchy: Level 1: Cybersecurity > Level
  2: Security Architecture And Engineering > Level 3: Information System Lifecycle > Level 4: Acquisition and Procurement
  > Level 5: Requirements Development for Acquisition > Level 6: Security Strength Requirements). Base content on this optimized
  synthesis:


  **Core Concepts (Layer 1 Foundation):** Security strength = assurance level against attacks; assurance via design/testing/monitoring;
  controls protect CIA; risk mgmt assesses threats/vulns/impacts. Prior knowledge: CIA Triad, threat modeling.


  **NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 (Layer 2 Components):** Controls structured as base (minimum), enhancements (strength/scalability),
  tailoring (risk-adjusted). Families e.g., AC (Access Control), AU (Audit), IA (Identification/Authentication). Sources:
  https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf.


  **Implementation (Layer 3):** Risk assess > select/tailor controls > specify in acquisition reqs.


  **Integration (Layer 4):** SDLC acquisition phase; prevents insecure design; links to supply chain.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list from above].


  **Active Learning:** [Insert summaries of discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving].


  Use flashcard schema: Front = MCQ/cloze question; Back = Answer + Explanation (ref Bloom''s/scaffolding/NIST) + Distractor
  explanations + References. Distractors: misconceptions, term confusion, partial truths. Balance: 10 foundational, 8 application,
  7 advanced. Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition, misconceptions addressed. Output as JSON array
