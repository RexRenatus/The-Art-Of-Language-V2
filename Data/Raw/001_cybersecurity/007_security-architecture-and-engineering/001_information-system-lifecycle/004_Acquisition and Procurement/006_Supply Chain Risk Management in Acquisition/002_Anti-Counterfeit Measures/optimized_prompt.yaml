active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between cost savings and counterfeit risks in procurement—using DoDI 4140.67 as
    a reference, propose improvements to balance security and efficiency.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student teaches the class NIST SP 800-161 Rev. 1 C-SCRM practices for counterfeit prevention;
    the partner quizzes them on key steps and standards.
  problem_solving: 'Simulate a supply chain breach: Teams identify counterfeit risks in a hypothetical acquisition of electronic
    components and design a mitigation strategy using SAE standards (e.g., AS5553).'
  additional_activities:
  - Role-playing supplier vetting negotiations to practice risk assessment questions.
  - Group categorization of parts (e.g., electronic components) as 'high-risk counterfeit targets' and justify using SCRM
    frameworks.
  - Address common misconceptions, such as assuming visual inspection alone suffices for counterfeit detection.

    vs. multi-method testing). 2) Similar/confused term (e.g., ''SCRM'' vs. ''SCM''). 3) Partial truth/overgeneralization
    (e.g., ''Only DoD applies'' vs. industry-wide). Ensure distractors test deeper understanding.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for university-level cybersecurity education on ''Anti-Counterfeit Measures''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture & Engineering > Information System Lifecycle > Acquisition and Procurement
  > Supply Chain Risk Management in Acquisition > Anti-Counterfeit Measures). Synthesize high-quality, spaced-repetition-optimized
  flashcards using Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning ties, and 4-layer scaffolding.

  **Learning Objectives (Cover evenly):** [Insert full learning_objectives array here]


  **Scaffolding Layers (10 cards per layer):** [Insert full scaffolding_layers array here]


  **Active Learning Ties:** Incorporate prompts/elements into explanations (e.g., ''Relates to problem-solving simulation'').


  **Flashcard Generation Rules:**

  - Generate exactly 40 flashcards (10 per layer, balanced across Bloom''s levels/objectives).

  - Use exact schema: JSON array of objects with ''front'', ''back'' (answer, explanation, distractors), ''tags'' (layer,
  bloom_level, standard).

  - 60% MCQ, 20% Short Answer, 10% Cloze, 10% TF.

  - Distractors: Follow protocol precisely.

  - Ensure completeness: Cover best practices (vetting, inspection, **Acceptance Testing**: functionality/authenticity verification
  via labs/serialization), misconceptions (e.g., visual inspection sufficiency).

  - Pedagogically optimized: Scaffolded progression, active recall, spaced repetition cues.


  Output ONLY the JSON array of 40 flashcards. No additional text.'
