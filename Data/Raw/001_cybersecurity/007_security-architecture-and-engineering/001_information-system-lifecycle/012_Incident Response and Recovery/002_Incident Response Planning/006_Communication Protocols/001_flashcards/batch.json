        "core_logic": "Patching OT systems requires careful consideration of potential negative impacts on operational performance, safety, and reliability, because OT systems often have strict uptime and real-time requirements unlike typical IT systems. Therefore, patches must be thoroughly tested in non-production environments before deployment.",

        "analogy": "Patching an OT system is like performing surgery on a patient during a critical operation – it must be done with extreme precision and only after thorough testing to avoid harming the patient (the process)."
