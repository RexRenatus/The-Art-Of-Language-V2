active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a post-incident review, debate the top 3 metrics (e.g., MTTD, MTTR, financial impact) for prioritizing
    future improvements. Justify your choices using examples from NIST SP 800-61r3 and real-world breaches like SolarWinds,
    considering trade-offs in resource allocation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
