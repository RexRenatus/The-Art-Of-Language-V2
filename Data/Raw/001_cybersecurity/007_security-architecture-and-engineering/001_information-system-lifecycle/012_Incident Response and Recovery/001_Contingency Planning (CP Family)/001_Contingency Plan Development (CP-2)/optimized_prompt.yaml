active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between minimizing Recovery Time Objective (RTO) versus Recovery Point Objective
    (RPO) in a hospital's contingency plan for a cyberattack. Use real-world examples (e.g., WannaCry ransomware impact on
    NHS) to support your position and consider compliance with HIPAA or NIST standards.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Content Foundation:** Use this complete research context:

  ### Core Concepts: Contingency Planning (CP): Strategy for IT recovery post-disruption. Disruption: Events like cyberattacks.
  RTO: Max downtime. RPO: Max data loss. Mission Functions: Essential ops. Contingency Plan: Document with procedures/roles.

  ### Standards: NIST SP 800-53 Rev5 CP-2: Develop plan identifying functions/requirements, recovery objectives, backups,
  restoration, roles, maintenance. NIST SP 800-34 Rev1: Contingency Planning Guide (full process: BIA → strategies → testing).

  ### Sources: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final, https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/34/r1/final, https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/olir/contingency-planning.


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Align flashcards to these Learning Objectives [insert full list]. Incorporate Active Learning:
  Reference discussion (RTO/RPO trade-offs), peer teaching (components), problem-solving (DDoS scenario). Scaffolding: Distribute
  across 4 Layers [insert full layers]. Prior Knowledge: RA, BIA, IR.


  **Generation Rules:** Follow Flashcard Schema exactly [insert full schema]. Ensure 100% accuracy to NIST. Vary difficulty
  progressively. Make explanations pedagogical (link to objectives/layers). Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, no extra
  text.'
