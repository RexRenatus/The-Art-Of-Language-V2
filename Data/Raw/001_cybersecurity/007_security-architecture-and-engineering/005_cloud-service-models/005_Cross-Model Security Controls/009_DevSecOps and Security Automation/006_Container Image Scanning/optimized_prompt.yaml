active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of scanning container images at build-time vs. runtime (e.g.,
    false positives, performance impact). Use real-world examples like Log4Shell CVE to support arguments and propose a hybrid
    approach for zero-trust architectures.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on
  ''Container Image Scanning'' using the exact topic hierarchy: [''Cybersecurity'', ''Security Architecture And Engineering'',
  ''Cloud Service Models'', ''Cross-Model Security Controls'', ''DevSecOps and Security Automation'', ''Container Image Scanning''].
  Strictly adhere to the provided learning_objectives, active_learning components, scaffolding_layers (including prior_knowledge
  and big_picture_context), and flashcard_schema. Ensure coverage: 4-5 cards per Bloom''s level/objective, 5-7 per layer,
  integrate voter priorities (e.g., SLSA=Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts Levels 0-4; tools Trivy/Clair/Snyk/Docker
  Scout; OWASP Container Security; examples like GitHub Actions). Use web-grounded facts: CVEs via NVD, SBOM via NTIA, prevent
  supply chain attacks. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards matching the schema exactly (snake_case fields, exactly 3 distractors
  per card, verbatim hierarchy). No extra text.'
