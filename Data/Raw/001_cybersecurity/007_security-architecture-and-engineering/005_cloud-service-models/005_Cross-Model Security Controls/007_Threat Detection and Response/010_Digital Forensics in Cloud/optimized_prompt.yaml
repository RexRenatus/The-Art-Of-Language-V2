active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how the shared responsibility model impacts forensic evidence collection
    in multi-tenant cloud environments. Consider challenges like data jurisdiction and propose mitigation strategies using
    CC FRA.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
