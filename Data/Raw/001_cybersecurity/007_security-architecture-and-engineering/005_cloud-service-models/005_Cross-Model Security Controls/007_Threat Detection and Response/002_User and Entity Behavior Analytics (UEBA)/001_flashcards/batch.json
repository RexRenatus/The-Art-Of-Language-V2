        "core_logic": "UEBA detects data exfiltration by identifying anomalous user or entity behavior, such as accessing large volumes of sensitive data, transferring files to unauthorized locations, or using unusual channels. This is because the act of stealing data often involves deviations from normal activity patterns.",

The camera doesn't stop them from carrying boxes (encryption) or block all exits (blocking transfers), but it flags the suspicious activity."
