active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast traditional SIEM with cloud-native SIEM in terms of scalability, cost, and threat
    detection capabilities. Which would you recommend for a mid-sized company adopting a multi-cloud strategy, and why? (Encourage
    debate on real-world trade-offs like vendor lock-in vs. elasticity.)
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse scalability with on-premises
      limits; mix up SIEM with SOAR; reference outdated tools).
    - Distractors should be 70% semantically similar to correct answer (e.g., 'manual scaling' vs. 'auto-scaling').
    - Ensure distractors test Bloom's progression (e.g., basic recall errors at Layer 1, integration pitfalls at Layer 4).
    - 'Balance: 40% factual errors, 30% partial truths, 30% irrelevant but cloud-related terms.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Cloud-Native SIEM (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cloud Service Models > Cross-Model Security Controls
  > Threat Detection and Response > Cloud-Native SIEM). Use the provided research context, completed with industry standards:


  **Completed Research Context:**

  Core Concepts: SIEM aggregates/analyzes security data; Cloud-Native SIEM leverages cloud principles (scalability, elasticity,
  pay-as-you-go, managed services, cloud integrations, AI/ML). SOAR integrates for automation.

  Industry Standards: NIST SP 800-53 (Security Controls), NIST SP 800-145 (Cloud Definitions), NIST Cybersecurity Framework;
  CISA Cloud Security Technical Reference Architecture (guidance on secure cloud logging/SIEM), CISA Secure Cloud Business
  Applications (SCuBA) for threat detection.

  Real-World Examples: Microsoft Sentinel (Azure-native, AI-powered), Splunk Cloud (multi-cloud SIEM), Elastic Security (open-source
  stack with cloud elasticity).
