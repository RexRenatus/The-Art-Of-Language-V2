active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of automated patch deployment in multi-cloud environments
    (e.g., AWS, Azure). Consider factors like downtime risks, compliance with NIST SP 800-40, and integration with vulnerability
    management from prior topics. Each participant must cite a specific tool (e.g., Ansible, SCCM) and propose a mitigation
    strategy.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate exactly 3 distractors per card: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse manual with automated
    steps), 2) Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., tool-specific error), 3) Irrelevant/outdated concept (e.g., ignore
    cloud context). Ensure distractors are realistic for cybersecurity learners, derived from research (NIST, tools), and
    explanations correct misconceptions progressively.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  Automated Patch Deployment (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cloud Service Models > Cross-Model
  Security Controls > Vulnerability and Patch Management > Automated Patch Deployment). Use the provided research context
  (core concepts: patch, vulnerability, exploit; lifecycle: detection-assessment-acquisition-testing-deployment-verification;
  tools: WSUS, SCCM, Puppet, Ansible; standards: NIST SP 800-40 Rev. 4 (enterprise planning), NIST SP 1800-31 (automated deployment
  in ICAM, full: detection via scanners, staged rollout, verification/rollback)) and voter consensus (complete coverage, tools
  expansion, prior links).


  Incorporate pedagogy: Learning objectives [insert full list above]; Active learning for context [discussion/peer/problem-solving];
  Scaffolding layers [insert full 4 layers]. Ensure progressive complexity, referencing prior layers/knowledge.


  Generate exactly 25 flashcards following this schema [insert full flashcard_schema above]. Balance: ~4 REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND
  (Layers 1-2), ~10 APPLY/ANALYZE (Layer 3), ~11 EVALUATE/CREATE (Layer 4). Questions promote active learning (apply to cloud
  scenarios, compare, design). Distractors per protocol.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcard objects, no additional text. Validate snake_case and structure.'
