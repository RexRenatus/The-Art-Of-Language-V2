  ## Application-Level Encryption Summary

  Application-level encryption encrypts data within the app before storage/transmission, protecting confidentiality/integrity
  beyond TLS/disk encryption. Core: Encryption (plaintext to ciphertext via algo+key), Decryption (reverse). Data states:
  At rest (storage), In transit (network), In use (memory). Symmetric (AES-256 fast for bulk), Asymmetric (RSA/ECC for key
  exchange). Key Management (NIST SP 800-57): generate/store/distribute/rotate/revoke. Standards: FIPS 140-3 (modules), NIST
  CSF (PR.DS-2 transit, PR.DS-3 rest), Cloud KMS (AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS). Best practices: Envelope encryption, HSMs. Example:
  Capital One breach (2019) - app-level could mitigate IAM flaws.
