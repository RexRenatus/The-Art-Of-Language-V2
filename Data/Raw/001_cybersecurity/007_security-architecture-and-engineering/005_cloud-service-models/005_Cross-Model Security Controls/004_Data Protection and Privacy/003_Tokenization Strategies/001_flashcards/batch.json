        "core_logic": "NIST SP 800-63B highlights that form-factor constraints on mobile devices significantly impact out-of-band authenticator usability. Features like single tap or copy/paste are recommended because they reduce manual text entry, thereby minimizing user errors and frustration, working by adapting the authentication process to the device's limitations.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors suggest manual entry, displaying secrets on locked devices, or using insecure channels like VoIP/email, all of which ignore or contradict NIST's usability recommendations for mobile out-of-band authentication.",
        "analogy": "Using out-of-band authentication on a mobile device without text entry features is like trying to write a novel on a tiny phone keypad; features like copy/paste or a single tap are much more user-friendly and efficient."
