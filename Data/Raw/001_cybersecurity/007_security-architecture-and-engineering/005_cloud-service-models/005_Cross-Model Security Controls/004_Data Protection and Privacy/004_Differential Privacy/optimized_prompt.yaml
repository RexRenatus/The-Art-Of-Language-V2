active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student teaches the step-by-step Laplace mechanism (sensitivity → noise scale → addition),
    while the other teaches the Gaussian mechanism; switch roles and quiz each other on formulas and cloud applicability.
  problem_solving: Given a cloud query summing user transaction counts (sensitivity Δf=1, ε=1.0), apply the Laplace mechanism
    to add noise; then evaluate utility loss and propose optimizations for cross-model security in AWS Glue.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Differential Privacy within\

  \ Models > Level 4: Cross-Model Security Controls > Level 5: Data Protection and Privacy > Level 6: Differential Privacy.\n\
  \nGenerate 20-30 high-quality flashcards optimized for spaced repetition and active recall. Base content on:\n- Research:\
  \ DP definition (output nearly identical with/without one individual's data), ε (privacy budget, smaller=stronger), δ (failure\
  \ prob), neighboring datasets, event/user-level privacy, Laplace (noise Lap(Δf/ε)), Gaussian, NIST SP 800-226 (DP guidelines\
  \ for federal stats).\n- Big picture: Cloud role (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS data protection), compliance (GDPR/HIPAA), re-identification\
  \ prevention.\n- Prior knowledge: Probability (Laplace/Gaussian), basic privacy.\n\n**Learning Objectives (span Bloom's\
  \ Taxonomy):** [Insert the 6 objectives above].\n\n**Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers above]. Balance coverage\
  \ across layers.\n\n**Active Learning Integration:** Draw from discussion (event vs user), peer-teach (mechanisms), problem-solving\
  \ (Laplace computation) for contextual explanations.\n\n**Output Format (JSON array of flashcards):** Strictly follow flashcard_schema:\n\
  {\n  \"flashcards\": [\n    {\n      \"front\": \"Question...\",\n      \"back\": {\n        \"correct_answer\": \"...\"\
