active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of cloud service models, debate whether achieving 'five nines' (99.999%) availability
    is worth the increased complexity and cost for a cybersecurity operations center. Use the CIA triad to argue pros (e.g.,
    enhanced Availability and Integrity during attacks) and cons (e.g., trade-offs with Confidentiality via over-provisioning
    risks).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
