active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, compare the security challenges of Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) versus traditional
    request-response models. How does the decoupled nature of EDA amplify risks like increased attack surface, and what mitigation
    strategies would you prioritize in a PaaS deployment? Support your arguments with examples from event types (user-generated,
    system-generated, external).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Progressive difficulty: Layer 1 distractors = superficial errors; Layer 4 = nuanced conceptual blends.'
    - 'Balance: 40% definition errors, 30% component mix-ups, 30% security implication twists.'
    - 'Explanations: Always justify correct answer and debunk each distractor explicitly.'

  Incorporate this research context: EDA structures apps around events (significant state changes: user-generated, system-generated,
  external/IoT). Components: Producers (generate events), Channels (routers/brokers), Consumers (react). Security risks: Increased
  attack surface from distributed/decoupled design, e.g., more producers/consumers expand vulnerabilities.
