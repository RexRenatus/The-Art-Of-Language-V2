active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In groups, debate whether a strict NIST SP 800-53 high-impact baseline is always necessary for PaaS platforms
    or if tailoring to moderate is sufficient for most commercial applications, citing real-world breach examples like the
    Capital One AWS incident and referencing CIS benchmarks or Microsoft Security Baselines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Baselines are one-time setups''),
    2) Related but incorrect term (e.g., ''Patching'' instead of ''Hardening''), 3) Edge case inversion (e.g., ''High-impact
    for all PaaS'' vs. tailored). Ensure plausibility from voter priorities and research context.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in CISSP Domain 3: Security
  Architecture and Engineering. Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on ''Platform Security Baseline Configuration'' (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cloud Service Models > Platform as a Service (PaaS) >
  Platform Configuration and Hardening > Platform Security Baseline Configuration). This fits the big picture of providing
  a secure foundation for cloud workloads.
