active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the security implications of maintaining legacy API versions in a PaaS
    environment. Consider real-world examples like shadow APIs and how poor deprecation practices could lead to vulnerabilities.
    What trade-offs exist between backward compatibility and security updates?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1 plausible misconception (e.g., confusing URI versioning with header), 1 partial truth
      (e.g., correct concept but wrong context), 1 common error (e.g., ignoring backward compatibility).'
    - 'Base on research: Use shadow APIs, legacy risks, or incomplete NIST concepts for realism.'
    - Ensure distractors promote analysis (e.g., tempt with insecure practices).
    variety: 'Mix formats: 40% Q&A/cloze (remember/understand), 30% MCQ (apply/analyze), 30% scenario-based (evaluate/create).'
