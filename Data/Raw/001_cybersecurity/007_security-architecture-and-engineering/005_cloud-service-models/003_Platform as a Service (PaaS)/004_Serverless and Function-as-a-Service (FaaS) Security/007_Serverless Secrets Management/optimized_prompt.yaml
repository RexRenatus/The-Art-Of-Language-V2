active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the security implications of using environment variables versus dedicated secrets managers (e.g.,
    AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) in serverless functions. Consider factors like convenience, auditability, attack
    surface, rotation capabilities, and compliance with NIST CSF.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol:
    mcq_format: 1 correct answer + 3 distractors. Total 4 options, randomized order.
    distractor_rules:
    - 'Distractor 1: Plausible common misconception (e.g., ''Store secrets in env vars for simplicity'' vs. correct ''Use
      dedicated managers'').'
    - 'Distractor 2: Related but incorrect tool/feature (e.g., ''Kubernetes ConfigMaps'' vs. ''Kubernetes Secrets'').'
    - 'Distractor 3: Unrelated or overly simplistic (e.g., ''Hardcode in source code'').'
    - Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter suggestions/web research (e.g., env vars risks, truncated Kubernetes
      info).
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university pedagogy (Bloom's\
  \ Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for the topic 'Serverless Secrets\
  \ Management' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cloud Service Models > PaaS > Serverless/FaaS\
  \ Security > Serverless Secrets Management).\n\nIncorporate:\n- Learning objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]\n- Active\
  \ learning: Tie cards to discussion (env vars vs. managers), peer teaching (tool comparisons), problem-solving (leak scenario).\n\
  - Scaffolding: Distribute across 4 layers [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM ABOVE].\n- Research context: Core concepts (serverless,\
  \ secrets); Tools (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Secret Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets for\
  \ serverless/Knative); Standards (NIST CSF, ISO 27001); Best practices (rotation, least-privilege, no env vars); Complete\
  \ Kubernetes Secrets: Base64-encoded, mounted volumes, risks if not encrypted; Sources: AWS Docs (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html),\
