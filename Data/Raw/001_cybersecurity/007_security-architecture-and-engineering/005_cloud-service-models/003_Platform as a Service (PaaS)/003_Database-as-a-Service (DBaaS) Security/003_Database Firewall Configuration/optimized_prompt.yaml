active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of deploying a database firewall in out-of-band monitoring
    mode versus proxy blocking mode within a PaaS DBaaS environment. Consider factors like performance impact, visibility,
    and threat response time, using real-world examples from cloud providers like Oracle.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Partial truth (e.g., monitoring but omit blocking), (3) Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., ''blocks all traffic''). Base
    on research context and voter priorities; ensure 60-70% plausibility to challenge without frustrating. Avoid obvious errors.'

  > Level 4: Platform as a Service (PaaS) > Level 5: Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) Security > Level 6: Database Firewall Configuration).
  Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (cover all 6 objectives provided), active learning (incorporate discussion/peer/problem-solving
  hints), scaffolding (distribute across 4 layers), and Anki-optimized best practices (spaced repetition, active recall, minimal
  info per card).


  Research Context: Database firewalls monitor/control SQL traffic (allow/log/alert/block/substitute). Deployment: Out-of-band
  monitoring (taps/SPAN), host monitor (agents), proxy (monitor/block). Policies evaluated in stages (Oracle docs).


  Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM JSON].

  Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM JSON].

  Flashcard Schema: Strictly follow [INSERT FULL SCHEMA FROM JSON]; output ONLY a JSON array of 30 flashcards.


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards: Balance Bloom''s (1-2 per level), layers (as specified), active elements (e.g., explanations
  prompt application/discussion). Ensure distractors follow protocol. Make questions contextual to PaaS/DBaaS. Output format:
  Array of objects matching schema exactly. No extra text.'
