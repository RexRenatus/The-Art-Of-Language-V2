active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of enabling comprehensive audit logging in a high-traffic
    DBaaS environment (e.g., performance overhead vs. security benefits). Propose strategies to mitigate risks while ensuring
    compliance with regulations like GDPR or HIPAA, and justify your recommendations using real-world examples from cloud
    providers like AWS RDS or Azure SQL Database.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
