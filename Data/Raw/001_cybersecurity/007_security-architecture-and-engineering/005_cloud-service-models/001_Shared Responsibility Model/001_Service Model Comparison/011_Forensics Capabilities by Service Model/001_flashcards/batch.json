      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "SaaS abstracts away the operating system, middleware, and application layers, leaving the customer with minimal control over the underlying infrastructure. This lack of control directly impacts forensic capabilities because the customer cannot directly access or manipulate the systems where data resides, making evidence collection heavily reliant on provider-provided logs and APIs because the provider manages the entire stack.",
