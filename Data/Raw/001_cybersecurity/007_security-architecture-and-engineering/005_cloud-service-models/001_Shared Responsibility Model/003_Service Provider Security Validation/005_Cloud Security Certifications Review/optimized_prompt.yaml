active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of pursuing vendor-neutral certifications like CCSP/CCSK
    versus vendor-specific ones like AWS Certified Security - Specialty for roles in cloud security architecture. Consider
    alignment with shared responsibility models and provider validation—provide evidence from standards like NIST SP 800-53
    or CSA CCM.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (provider secures physical, customer OS)—distractors: ''Provider secures apps'', ''Customer secures hypervisor'', ''Shared
    for all layers''. Use partial truths from standards (e.g., mix NIST/CSA controls), vendor-specific vs neutral confusions,
    outdated Rev numbers (e.g., NIST 800-53r4 vs r5). Ensure 1-2 highly plausible to test analysis.'

  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives** (Bloom''s): [paste full list above].

  - **Active Learning**: Tie flashcards to discussion/peer-teaching/problem-solving (e.g., scenario cards for exercises).

  - **Scaffolding**: Distribute cards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4.

  - **Research Context**: NIST SP 800-53r5 (controls), SP 800-144 (cloud privacy), CSA CCM v4, Security Guidance v4.0, ISO
  27017. Certifications: CCSP ((ISC)², prereqs 5yrs, topics: architecture/data sec), CCSK (CSA, foundational), AWS Security
  Specialty (vendor maps), Azure Security Engineer, GCP Cloud Security Engineer (pros: deep vendor knowledge; cons: less portable).
  Shared model: Provider (physical/infra), Customer (data/apps).

  - **Voter Consensus**: Emphasize cert reviews (pros/cons, exam alignment), complete CSA details, sources with links.


  **Output Format**: JSON array of objects: [{''id'':1, ''type'':''mcq|qa|scenario'', ''question'':''...'', ''answer'':''...'',
  ''distractors'':[''A'',''B'',''C''], ''explanation'':''...'', ''blooms_level'':''REMEMBER'', ''scaffolding_layer'':''1'',
  ''hierarchy'':''Level 4'', ''sources'':[''link1'']}, ...]. Generate 80 unique cards, balanced across levels/layers. Ensure
  active recall, no hints in questions. Use distractor protocol for MCQs.'
