  **Research Context (Complete & Web-Grounded):**

  Right to Audit Clauses grant clients the right to audit vendor security practices, crucial in cloud Shared Responsibility
  Model. Key NIST SP 800-53 Rev5 Controls:

  - AU (Audit & Accountability): AU-2(3) audit events, AU-6 review/analysis, AU-12 generation/protection.

  - AC (Access Control): AC-2 account management, AC-6 least privilege.

  - CM (Configuration Management): CM-2 baselines, CM-8 vulnerability scanning.

  - CP (Contingency Planning): CP-2 plans, CP-4 testing, CP-9 recovery.

  Other: RA (Risk Assessment), SC (System/Communications Protection).

  Big Picture: Enables oversight for compliance (GDPR Art.28, HIPAA BAA), supply chain risk mitigation.
