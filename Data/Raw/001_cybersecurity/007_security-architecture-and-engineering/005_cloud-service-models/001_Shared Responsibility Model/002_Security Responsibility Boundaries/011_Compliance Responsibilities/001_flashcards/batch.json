      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "A SCRM plan must cover the entire lifecycle (R&D through disposal) because risks can be introduced at any stage, and a comprehensive plan ensures continuous risk management from inception to end-of-life.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly narrow the SCRM plan's scope to only a few lifecycle stages, failing to recognize that risks exist and must be managed throughout the entire system lifecycle.",
        "analogy": "A SCRM plan covering the entire lifecycle is like a comprehensive warranty for a product – it addresses risks from manufacturing to end-of-life, not just the initial purchase."
