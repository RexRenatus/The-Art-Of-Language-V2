  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the following: ''In a SaaS deployment like Office 365, should the customer
    ever be responsible for patching the application server? Why or why not?'' Encourage critical thinking by requiring participants
    to reference provider documentation (e.g., AWS, Azure) and voter-suggested examples of multi-tenant isolation.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    1. Common misconception (e.g., ''Customer always patches OS in PaaS'').

    2. Role reversal (e.g., attribute provider duty to customer).

    3. Edge case confusion (e.g., mix IaaS/SaaS responsibilities).

    Ensure distractors promote analysis (e.g., partial truths). Balance card types: 40% remember/understand, 30% apply/analyze,
    30% evaluate/create.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security Architecture and
  Engineering (Domain: Cloud Service Models > Shared Responsibility Model > Security Responsibility Boundaries > Cloud Provider
  Responsibility Scope). Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cloud Service Models > Shared
  Responsibility Model > Security Responsibility Boundaries > Cloud Provider Responsibility Scope.


  Voter consensus (68.6% approval): Emphasize completeness (full IaaS/PaaS/SaaS matrices), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression,
  4 scaffolding layers), visuals (tables/diagrams), prior knowledge (cloud basics).


  Research context: Shared model = ''security OF the cloud'' (provider: infra, physical, hypervisors) vs ''IN the cloud''
  (customer: data/apps/configs). Use AWS/Azure examples; map to NIST CSF.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [paste the array above].

  - Active learning: Embed hints (e.g., ''Use for peer teaching'').

  - Scaffolding: [paste the 4 layers above, including matrices/tables].


  Generate 75 high-quality flashcards using this exact schema: [paste flashcard_schema.structure and rules above].


  Ensure university pedagogy: Bloom''s coverage, active recall, spaced repetition friendly. Cards must be precise, complete
  PaaS/SaaS details, avoid truncation. Output ONLY the JSON array of flashcards.'
