active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges of siloed security policies in hybrid and multi-cloud environments
    (e.g., inconsistent enforcement across AWS and Azure). Propose how USPM, informed by the Shared Responsibility Model,
    resolves these while ensuring compliance with NIST CSF. Support arguments with real-world examples from finance or healthcare.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    ''equivalent to tool consolidation''). Each with ''text'' and ''why_wrong'' explaining error pedagogically. Vary types:
    partial truths, opposites, unrelated concepts.'

  Model'', ''Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Security'', ''Unified Security Policy Management''].


  Research Context: USPM consolidates security policies across IT (on-prem, cloud, mobile). Core: Security Policy (rules for
  assets), USPM (centralized management), Enforcement (apply controls), Auditing (verify compliance), ZTA (''never trust,
  always verify''; USPM enables granular enforcement across access points). NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2: Supports RMF by categorizing
  risks, selecting/implementing controls enterprise-wide. NIST CSF: Aligns Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover. Big Picture:
  Scalable for Security Architecture, compliance (e.g., finance PCI-DSS, healthcare HIPAA), resilience in multi-cloud. Misconceptions:
  Not cloud-only; not just tools—true policy unification. Sources: NIST SP 800-37r2 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-37r2.pdf),
  NIST SP 800-207 ZTA (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf), NIST CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework).
