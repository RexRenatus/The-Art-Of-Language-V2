active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between using crash-consistent versus application-consistent
    snapshots for securing critical workloads in IaaS. Consider factors like performance, data integrity, security risks,
    and recovery time objectives (RTO). Provide evidence from NIST SP 800-209.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions from research (e.g., confuse crash-consistent
      with application-consistent; mix up incremental/full snapshot storage implications).
    - 'Distractors must be realistic: e.g., partially correct but missing key security element (no encryption), or reversed
      concepts.'
    - Ensure 25% basic (Layer 1), 25% components (Layer 2), 30% implementation (Layer 3), 20% integration (Layer 4).
    - 'Balance Bloom''s: 20% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate, 20% Create.'

  Core content from research: Volume snapshots are point-in-time copies for backup/recovery. Types: crash-consistent (disk
  state, potential inconsistencies), application-consistent (flushes memory for reliability), incremental (changes only),
  full (entire volume). NIST SP 800-209 covers storage security: access control, encryption, isolation, restoration, threats
  from complexity.


  Incorporate these LEARNING OBJECTIVES (span Bloom''s Taxonomy):

  1. Remember: Define volume snapshot and uses.

  2. Understand: Differentiate snapshot types.

  3. Apply: Outline secure snapshot creation steps.

  4. Analyze: Identify risks.

  5. Evaluate: Assess NIST guidelines.

  6. Create: Design security policy.


  Use SCAFFOLDING LAYERS progressively:

  1. Foundation: Basic terms.

  2. Components: NIST frameworks.

  3. Implementation: Best practices.

  4. Integration: Broader IaaS connections.


  Embed ACTIVE LEARNING hooks in explanations (e.g., discussion on trade-offs, peer teaching on types, problem-solving for
  recovery).


  Generate 20 high-quality flashcards (mix: 40% MCQ, 30% Basic Cloze, 30% Short Answer) following FLASHCARD SCHEMA exactly:

  - Structure: As defined (front/back).

  - Distractors: 3 plausible per MCQ (misconceptions, partial truths).

  - Explanations: Detailed, source-linked, Bloom''s/scaffolding tagged, active learning extension.

  - Output: Array of JSON objects, each: {''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''blooms_level'': ''Remember|etc.'',
  ''scaffolding_layer'': 1-4, ''objective_id'': 1-6}


  Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, no hints on front. Cover all objectives/layers evenly.
  Output ONLY the JSON array.'
