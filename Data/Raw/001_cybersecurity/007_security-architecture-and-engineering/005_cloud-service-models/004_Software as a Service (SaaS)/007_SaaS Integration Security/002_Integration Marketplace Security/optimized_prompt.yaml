active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of SaaS integration marketplaces like Zapier or MuleSoft Exchange, debate the effectiveness
    of NIST SP 800-207 Zero Trust Architecture principles versus traditional perimeter security models for protecting data
    in transit across multiple vendor integrations. Consider trade-offs in usability, cost, and implementation complexity,
    and address misconceptions such as implicit trust in vendor connectors (e.g., lessons from SolarWinds breach).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
