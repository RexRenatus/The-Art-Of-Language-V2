active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a SaaS application handling user-uploaded XML, debate the trade-offs of fully disabling DTDs versus
    allowing parameterized external entities. Consider performance, compliance (e.g., OWASP ASVS), and real-world attack scenarios
    like Billion Laughs DoS.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Learning objectives: [Insert full list verbatim].

  Active learning for context: [Insert discussion/peer/problem-solving verbatim; inspire reflective cards].


  Use this exact schema for output: Array of JSON objects, each matching the flashcard_schema structure.

  Ensure:

  - Questions test higher-order thinking where possible (e.g., ''Evaluate this config...'' ).

  - Explanations link to SaaS (e.g., ''In SaaS APIs, pair with WAF'').

  - Distractors per protocol.

  - Coverage: Even distribution across layers/Bloom''s.

  - No spoilers in fronts; engaging, precise language.

  Output ONLY the JSON array, e.g., [{front: ''...'', ...}, ...]. No extra text.'
