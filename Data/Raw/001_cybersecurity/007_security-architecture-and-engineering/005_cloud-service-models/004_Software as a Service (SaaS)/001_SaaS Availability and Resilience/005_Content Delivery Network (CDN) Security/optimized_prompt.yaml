active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the security trade-offs of using a CDN for a high-traffic e-commerce site during Black Friday.
    Debate whether the benefits (e.g., DDoS protection, low latency) outweigh risks like cache poisoning and DDoS amplification,
    using real-world examples from Cloudflare or Akamai incidents. Consider OWASP Top 10 implications such as A05:2021 Security
    Misconfiguration.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Plausible but incorrect extreme (e.g., ''Disable all caching'' for security), 3) Related but off-topic (e.g., mix with
    non-CDN attack like SQL injection). Base on research context, OWASP errors, real configs from Cloudflare/Akamai. Ensure
    distractors are 70-80% plausible to force analysis.'
