active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare SAML 2.0 Web Browser SSO Profile with OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow for SaaS apps. Debate
    trade-offs in security (e.g., assertion signing vs. token introspection), user experience (e.g., redirect flows), and
    implementation complexity (e.g., Okta vs. Auth0 integrations). Cite real-world examples and prior knowledge of basic authentication/SSO.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - '3 plausible distractors for MCQs: Based on common errors (e.g., confuse IdP/SP roles, mix bindings/protocols, omit
      security steps).'
    - Make distractors 70% similar to correct (e.g., HTTP POST vs. 'HTTP GET' as distractor).
    - 'Avoid obvious wrongs; ground in research (e.g., Artifact Binding uses back-channel, distractor: ''browser-only'').'
    - 'True/False: Distractors flip key facts (e.g., ''SAML uses JSON'' vs. XML).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  SAML 2.0 Configuration and Security (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cloud Service Models
  > SaaS > SaaS Identity and Access Management > SAML 2.0 Configuration and Security). Use the provided research context (core
  concepts: SAML Assertion types, Protocols like Auth Request/Single Logout/Artifact Resolution, Bindings: HTTP Redirect/POST/Artifact;
  complete SP as ''entity relying on IdP''; config: metadata exchange/bindings; security: signing/encryption/clock skew/replay
  protection) and expand with best practices.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert array above]

  - Active Learning: Use for context/explanations (e.g., reference discussion trade-offs in explanations).

  - Scaffolding: Generate flashcards strictly layered (Layer 1: Foundation basics; Layer 2: Components/protocols/bindings;
  Layer 3: Config steps; Layer 4: Security/integration).

  - Prior knowledge: Link to auth/SSO/HTTP/XML.

  - Big picture: Federated SSO for SaaS zero-trust.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: JSON array of 50 flashcards, balanced across layers/Bloom''s. Use distractor protocol for
  MCQs. Ground in sources/web standards (OASIS SAML 2.0). Ensure active recall, no hints in fronts. Output ONLY the JSON array.'
