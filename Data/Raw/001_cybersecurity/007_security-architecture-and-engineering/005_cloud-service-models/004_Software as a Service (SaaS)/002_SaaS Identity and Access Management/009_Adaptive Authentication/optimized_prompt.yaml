  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains key contextual factors (e.g., geolocation, device info, behavior) used in
    adaptive authentication, while the partner creates and asks quiz questions or examples. Switch roles after 5 minutes.
    Addresses misconceptions like confusing static vs. dynamic auth.
  problem_solving: 'Present a real-world scenario: ''A user logs into a SaaS HR platform from a new device in an unfamiliar
    country at 3 AM to approve payroll.'' Students design an adaptive auth policy: identify risk factors, select AALs per
    NIST, and outline MFA steps. Apply to cloud IAM.'

  **Full Research Context:**

  ## Adaptive Authentication: A Comprehensive Summary

  Adaptive authentication dynamically adjusts requirements based on risk. Balances security/UX.

  ### Core Concepts

  - Adaptive Authentication: Dynamic adjustment via context.

  - Risk-Based: Assess/mitigate auth risks.

  - Contextual Factors: User behavior, device info, location, transaction sensitivity, historical data.

  - AALs: NIST-defined levels.

  - MFA: Applied selectively.

  ### Standards

  - NIST SP 800-63B (Digital Identity Guidelines): AAL1 (single-factor), AAL2 (multi-factor), AAL3 (hardware phishing-resistant).

  ### Sources

  - NIST: https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html
