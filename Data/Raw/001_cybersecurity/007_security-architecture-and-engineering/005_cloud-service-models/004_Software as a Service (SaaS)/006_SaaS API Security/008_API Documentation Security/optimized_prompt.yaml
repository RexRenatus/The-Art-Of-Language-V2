active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a debate format, argue whether API documentation should include full example payloads with sensitive
    data placeholders or avoid them entirely to prevent misuse by attackers. Use OWASP API Security Top 10 as reference to
    spark critical thinking on security vs. usability trade-offs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., ''Never document authentication''). Base on real errors from sources like OWASP case studies or NIST examples.'
