active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the trade-offs of integrating third-party APIs for rapid innovation versus the expanded attack
    surface and regulatory risks, using the Okta 2022 breach as a case study. Consider: How does this impact SaaS providers
    in the digital supply chain?'

  Incorporate this synthesized content:

  - **Core Concepts**: API, Third-Party API, Integration, Attack Surface, Digital Supply Chain, Security Due Diligence, Secure-by-Design,
  Principle of Least Privilege, Microsegmentation.

  - **Standards/Frameworks**: OWASP API Security Top 10 (e.g., Broken Authentication, BOLA), OAuth 2.0 (scopes, flows), OpenID
  Connect, NIST SP 800-53 (API controls), secure-by-design principles.

  - **Risks/Best Practices**: Expanded attack surface, breaches (Okta 2022), mitigations (API Gateway for auth/rate limiting,
  least privilege, vendor vetting, logging/monitoring).

  - **Sources**: OWASP.org/api-security, NIST.gov/sp800-53, oauth.net/2, Okta breach reports.
