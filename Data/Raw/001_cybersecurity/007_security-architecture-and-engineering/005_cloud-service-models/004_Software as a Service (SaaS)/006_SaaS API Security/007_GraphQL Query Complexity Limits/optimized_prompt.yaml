active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between strict query depth limiting (e.g., max depth 5)
    and flexible cost analysis in preventing DoS attacks. Consider developer productivity, user experience, and security in
    a SaaS environment. Cite OWASP GraphQL Cheat Sheet examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
