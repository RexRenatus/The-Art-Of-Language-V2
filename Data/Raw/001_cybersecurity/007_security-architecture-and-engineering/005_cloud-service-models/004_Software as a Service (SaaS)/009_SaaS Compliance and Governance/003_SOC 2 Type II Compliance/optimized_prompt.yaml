active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a resource-constrained startup, should a SaaS company prioritize Security only or pursue all Trust
    Services Criteria for SOC 2 Type II? Debate the pros (e.g., faster time-to-market), cons (e.g., incomplete trust signals),
    and long-term implications (e.g., enterprise sales barriers).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ:

    - 1 based on common misconceptions (e.g., ''SOC 2 is a certification issued by AICPA'' vs. ''attestation report'').

    - 1 partial truth (e.g., ''Type I evaluates over 6 months'' vs. actual point-in-time).

    - 1 unrelated/exaggerated (e.g., ''SOC 2 only for IaaS'').

    Ground in research context; avoid obvious wrongs. For True/False, one distractor as false rationale.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert educational flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity compliance for SaaS. Generate
  high-quality, Anki-optimized flashcards for ''SOC 2 Type II Compliance'' (Category: Cybersecurity; Domain: Security Architecture
  And Engineering; Subdomain: Cloud Service Models; Entry: SaaS; Entry Sub: SaaS Compliance/Governance; Hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > Security Arch/Eng > Cloud Models > SaaS > SaaS Comp/Gov > SOC 2 Type II).


  **Research Context (Complete):** SOC 2 Type II is an AICPA framework for service orgs (e.g., SaaS) handling customer data.
  Auditor attests to control suitability and effectiveness over ~6 months (vs. Type I: design only, point-in-time). TSC: Security
  (req: protect info/systems); Availability (opt: uptime); Processing Integrity (opt: accurate processing); Confidentiality
  (opt: protect confidential info); Privacy (opt: per privacy notice/GAPP). Attestation: Formal auditor statement. Essential
  for trust, enterprise sales.

  **Concept Map:** Central: SOC 2 Type II → AICPA Standards → Service Orgs (SaaS) | Audits (6mo effectiveness) → TSC (Security
  mand; others opt) → CC series (e.g., CC6.1 Logical Access).


  **Integrate:** Learning objectives [paste array above]; Active learning [discussion/peer/problem-solving for inspiration];
  Scaffolding layers [4 layers above]; Prior knowledge (SaaS shared resp., ISO 27001, GDPR).


  **Task:** Generate 40-50 flashcards per exact schema above. Cover all objectives/Bloom''s/scaffolding. Use active learning
  for scenario Qs. Distractors from misconceptions (e.g., cert vs. attestation). Ensure university pedagogy: spaced repetition-friendly,
  explanations scaffold to higher Bloom''s. Output ONLY valid JSON array.'
