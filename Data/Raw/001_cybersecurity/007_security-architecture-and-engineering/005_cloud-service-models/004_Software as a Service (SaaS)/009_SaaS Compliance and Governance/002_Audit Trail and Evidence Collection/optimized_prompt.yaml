active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between comprehensive audit trail logging for security and potential privacy concerns
    in SaaS environments, using real-world examples like GDPR violations. Consider how audit trails support proactive monitoring
    versus post-incident forensics.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate plausible distractors based on common misconceptions: 1. Confusing audit trails with access
    logs only (ignore outcomes/non-repudiation); 2. Assuming audit trails are solely post-incident (vs. proactive monitoring);
    3. Overlooking SaaS privacy trade-offs (e.g., excessive logging violates GDPR); 4. Misapplying shared responsibility (customer
    vs. provider logs); 5. Incomplete NIST controls (e.g., logging events but skipping analysis). Ensure distractors are realistic
    and teachable moments.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Generate\
  \ 20-30 high-quality Anki-style flashcards for the topic 'Audit Trail and Evidence Collection' in the hierarchy: Cybersecurity\
  \ > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cloud Service Models > Software as a Service (SaaS) > SaaS Compliance and Governance\
  \ > Audit Trail and Evidence Collection.\n\nIncorporate these pedagogical elements:\n- Learning Objectives: [insert full\
  \ list from above]\n- Active Learning: [insert full active_learning JSON]\n- Scaffolding: [insert full scaffolding JSON]\n\
  \nEnsure flashcards progress through Bloom's Taxonomy and scaffolding layers (aim for balanced distribution: 20% Layer 1/REMEMBER-UNDERSTAND,\
  \ 30% Layer 2-3/APPLY-ANALYZE, 50% Layer 4/EVALUATE-CREATE). Draw from NIST SP 800-92 (log management steps), NIST SP 800-53\
  \ (AU controls), SOC 2, CSA CCCS-07, GDPR privacy trade-offs, zero-trust, shared responsibility, non-repudiation, forensics,\
  \ and big-picture SaaS governance (e.g., portable logs to avoid vendor lock-in).\n\nFollow this exact output schema for\
  \ each flashcard as a JSON array:\n[\n  {\n    \"front\": \"Question text (MCQ, cloze, etc.)\",\n    \"back\": \"Correct\
  \ answer\",\n    \"explanation\": \"Detailed explanation with why correct and distractors wrong, SaaS context, references.\"\

  ,\n    \"reference\": \"e.g., NIST SP 800-92\",\n    \"active_learning_link\": \"Optional: e.g., Ties to problem-solving\
  \ exercise\"\n  }\n]\n\nUse the flashcard schema's distractor protocol for MCQs. Make questions challenging yet fair, promoting\
  \ active recall. Ensure content is accurate, web-grounded, and optimized for spaced repetition."
