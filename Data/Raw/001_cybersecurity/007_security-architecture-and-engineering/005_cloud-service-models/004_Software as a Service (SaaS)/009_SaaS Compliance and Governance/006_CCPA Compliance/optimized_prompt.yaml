active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate whether an IP address combined with browsing history constitutes 'personal information' under
    CCPA, using real-world SaaS examples like ad targeting. Consider counterarguments, regulatory nuances (e.g., inferences
    from data), enforcement cases, and implications for security architecture.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  CCPA Compliance (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cloud Service Models > SaaS > SaaS Compliance
  and Governance > CCPA Compliance). Use this COMPLETE research context: [Insert full expanded summary here, including truncated
  parts: PI/SPI/Consumer/Business defs; full rights (Know/Delete/Opt-Out/Correct/Limit SPI/Non-Discrimination); obligations
  (notices, inventory, 45-day responses); thresholds; roles (Service Provider/Contractor/Third Party); Sale/Sharing (CPRA:
  sharing for cross-context ads); SaaS best practices (data mapping, DPAs, minimization, logging, opt-out UI); penalties ($2.5K-$7.5K/violation);
  sources (oag.ca.gov, secureframe.com, etc.)]. Incorporate prerequisites (GDPR basics, data classification), big picture
  (SaaS shared responsibility), and concept map structure.


  Learning Objectives: [Paste the 6 objectives above]. Scaffolding: [Paste the 4 layers]. Active Learning: Use elements to
  inspire higher-order cards (e.g., scenario-based MCQs from problem-solving).


  Generate flashcards per schema: [Paste schema]. Output ONLY in JSON array: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'':
  ''...'', ''blooms_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...''}]. Ensure pedagogical progression, active
  recall, spaced repetition optimization. No adult/offensive content.'
