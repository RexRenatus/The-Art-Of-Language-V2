active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a think-pair-share activity, debate whether FedRAMP authorization adequately addresses emerging threats
    like AI-driven attacks in cloud services, comparing it to NIST 800-53 baselines. Share agency-specific examples and address
    misconceptions that FedRAMP is static.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
