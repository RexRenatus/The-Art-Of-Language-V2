active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a SaaS platform serving healthcare providers, debate the trade-offs of using separate databases for
    multi-tenancy versus shared databases with row-level security. Consider security, cost, scalability, and compliance with
    HIPAA. Which approach would you recommend and why? Identify common misconceptions about 'perfect' isolation in each model.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1. Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Uses row-level
    security'' for separate DB). 2. Confusions between shared/separate (e.g., ''Cost-effective at scale''). 3. Partial truths
    (e.g., ''Moderate isolation'' instead of ''strong''). 4. Irrelevant standards (e.g., ''PCI-DSS only''). Ensure distractors
    are realistic from voter priorities/web context.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 40-60 high-quality flashcards on ''Separate Database Multi-Tenancy
  Security'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cloud Service Models > SaaS > Multi-Tenancy

  **Research Context (Complete and expand as needed with accurate knowledge):** [Insert full provided research context here,
  completing FedRAMP: FedRAMP requires moderate/high baselines for multi-tenant SaaS with strong tenant isolation (e.g., IR-4
  incident response, SC-2 app partitioning); Sources: NIST SP 800-53 Rev5 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final),
  OWASP Multi-Tenancy Cheat Sheet (https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Multi_Tenancy_Cheat_Sheet.html), AWS Multi-Tenant
  SaaS Guidance (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/saas-storage/multi-tenant-data.html), FedRAMP Marketplace
  (https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/)] Core concepts: Multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, separate/shared DB, noisy neighbor,
  data sovereignty.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full array above].

  **Active Learning:** Use for context/inspiration: [Insert discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving above].

  **Scaffolding:** Strictly layer flashcards progressively: 30% Layer1, 25% Layer2, 25% Layer3, 20% Layer4. [Insert full scaffolding
  above, including prerequisites/concept map].


  **Flashcard Generation Rules:**

  - Distribute across Bloom''s: 20% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate, 20% Create.

  - 60% MCQs (4 options), 20% Cloze deletions, 20% Short-answer/application.

  - Follow exact schema: [Insert full flashcard_schema above].

  - Ensure web-grounded: Cite sources, avoid hallucinations.

  - Vary difficulty: 40% beginner (Layer1), 60% advanced.

  - Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''id'':1, ''front'':''...'', ''back'':{''answer'':''...'', ''options'':[''A...'',''B...''],
  ''explanation'':''...'', ''bloom_level'':''...'', ''layer'':''...'', ''reference'':''...''}}]. No extra text.'
