active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In SaaS environments, debate whether monitoring data in motion (e.g., email leaks via unauthorized sharing)
    is more critical than data at rest (e.g., cloud storage misconfigurations) or data in use. Use real-world examples like
    the 2023 MOVEit breach or Slack PII exposures to argue your position and link to the CIA triad.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Data in memory'' instead
    of ''in use''); 2) Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Only data at rest'' omitting motion/use); 3) Related but
    incorrect concept (e.g., ''Encryption only'' vs. full DLP). Ensure distractors test nuance (e.g., SaaS vs. on-prem).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on ''Data Loss Prevention (DLP)''
  in SaaS Data Security (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cloud Service Models > SaaS
  > SaaS Data Security > DLP). Voter consensus: 100% approval on completeness, pedagogy, scaffolding.


  **Content Base:** Use this synthesized knowledge:

  - Foundation (Layer 1): DLP def, data states (motion/rest/use), sensitive data (PII/PHI/IP), CIA triad/SaaS links, big picture
  (SaaS breach reduction).

  - Components (Layer 2): Policies/discovery/monitoring/enforcement; Concept map (DLP → States → Types → Risks → Controls).

  - Implementation (Layer 3): Deploy/test rules in SaaS (Slack/Drive).

  - Integration (Layer 4): CASB/SIEM; Standards (NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS).


  **Learning Objectives:** Cover all 6 provided (1-2 cards per objective, spanning REMEMBER to CREATE).

  **Active Learning Integration:** Ensure cards prompt application/discussion (e.g., ''Debate: Motion vs. rest?'').

  **Scaffolding:** Distribute cards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4; Build from basic to integrative.


  **Output Format (JSON array of 50 flashcards):** Each: {''id'':1, ''bloom_level'':''REMEMBER'', ''scaffolding_layer'':''1'',
  ''front'':''Question'', ''type'':''MCQ'', ''options'':[''A'',''B'',''C'',''D''], ''back'':{''answer'':''A'', ''explanation'':''...'',
  ''hints'':[''...''], ''source'':''IBM.com/NIST''}} or Basic Q&A equivalent. Follow exact flashcard_schema. Vary types for
  engagement. Ensure distractors are educationally valuable. No duplicates; cover all key points/standards/examples.'
