active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the relevance of Van Eck phreaking in 2020s remote work setups with laptops
    and multiple monitors. Consider recent research on LCD/OLED vulnerabilities and evaluate if TEMPEST standards are practical
    for non-government organizations. Support arguments with historical context (e.g., Wim van Eck's 1985 demonstration) and
    propose one innovative countermeasure.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1. Common misconception (e.g., confuses with acoustic attacks),
    2. Related but incorrect concept (e.g., power analysis instead of EM), 3. Partial truth (e.g., outdated CRT-only focus).
    Ensure distractors are web-grounded (e.g., from TEMPEST history) and test deeper understanding.'
