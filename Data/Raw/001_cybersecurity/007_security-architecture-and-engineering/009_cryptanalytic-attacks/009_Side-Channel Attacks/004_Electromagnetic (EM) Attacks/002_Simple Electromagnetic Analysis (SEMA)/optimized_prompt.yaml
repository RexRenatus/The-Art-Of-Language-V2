active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of IoT devices processing AES encryption, discuss the trade-offs between implementing
    costly EM shielding (per ITU-T K.87) versus software masking for SEMA mitigation. What factors (e.g., cost, performance
    impact) would influence your recommendation for a resource-constrained environment?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truths (e.g., mention power instead of EM); 3) Related but incorrect terms (e.g., TEMPEST as attack vs. standard);
    4) Edge cases (e.g., invasive vs. non-invasive). Ensure plausibility for university-level learners.'

  Incorporate this optimized pedagogy:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL 4 LAYERS FROM ABOVE]


  Generate 25 high-quality MCQ flashcards using the exact schema:

  Front: Question + A/B/C/D options

  Back: correct_answer | explanation | distractors (with why wrong) | bloom_level | scaffolding_layer | active_learning_tie_in
  (if applicable)


  Rules:

  - Cover all objectives, layers, and voter priorities (e.g., ITU-T K.84/K.87 details, hands-on steps, AES/RSA examples, mitigations
  like shielding/masking, comparisons to SPA).

  - Ensure accuracy: SEMA is an attack (EM traces for key recovery), not just defense; link to EMSEC/TEMPEST.

  - Distractors per protocol.

  - University-style: Active recall, spaced repetition friendly.

  - Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}}, ...]


  Sources for context: ITU-T K.84 (EM immunity/measurement), K.87 (EM security guidelines), TEMPEST standards, research on
  EM side-channels (e.g., AES key recovery via probes).'
