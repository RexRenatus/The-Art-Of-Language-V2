  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the real-world implications of VPA on IoT devices running AES encryption:
    How does VPA exploit power leakage compared to software vulnerabilities? What trade-offs do countermeasures introduce
    in terms of performance and cost? Support arguments with examples from cryptanalytic literature.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

    - Common misconceptions (e.g., confuse VPA with OT power integrity, HPA as multi-trace, SPA as statistical)

    - Partial truths (e.g., ''Uses single trace'' for VPA card)

    - Related but wrong terms (e.g., timing analysis, brute-force)

    Ensure 1-2 highly plausible (e.g., swap VPA/HPA definitions).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in cryptanalytic side-channel
  attacks. Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for ''Vertical Power Analysis'' (VPA) under the hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cryptanalytic Attacks > Side-Channel Attacks > Power Analysis Attacks > Vertical
  Power Analysis.


  CRITICAL: VPA is a SIDE-CHANNEL CRYPTANALYSIS ATTACK: Multi-trace statistical analysis aligning power traces vertically
  (same time point across executions) to recover keys via models like Hamming weight. Contrasts HPA (single-trace). IGNORE
  OT/power integrity/EMI/NIST 800-82.
