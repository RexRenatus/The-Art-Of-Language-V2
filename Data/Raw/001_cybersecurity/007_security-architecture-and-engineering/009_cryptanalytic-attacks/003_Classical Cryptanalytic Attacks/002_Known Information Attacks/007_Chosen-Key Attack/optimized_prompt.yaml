active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast chosen-key attacks with chosen-plaintext (CPA) and chosen-ciphertext (CCA) attacks.
    Under what conditions might a chosen-key attack be more powerful (e.g., in hash functions or weak key schedules)? How
    do modern protocols like TLS mitigate this through key derivation functions?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    with CPA). 2) Partial truths (e.g., ''Only for hashes'' when applies to ciphers). 3) Similar concepts (e.g., ''Known-key
    attack''). 4) Unrelated attacks (e.g., ''Side-channel''). Ensure 1 best answer, distractors 70-80% plausible but wrong.
    Use for 60% of cards as MCQ.'

  Use this synthesized content to generate flashcards:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert array from above]

  - Active Learning: Embed 2-3 cards per activity (e.g., discussion-style MCQs).

  - Scaffolding: [insert full scaffolding object]. Ensure cards progress layers.

  - Research Facts: Attacker chooses keys for oracle; powerful for hashes/ciphers; Mitigate via NIST SP 800-57 key mgmt (secure
  RNGs, lifecycle); Links to CPA/CCA but distinct.


  Generate exactly 30 flashcards following the Flashcard Schema [insert schema above]. Output as JSON array of objects. Vary
  formats: 40% MCQ (w/ 4 options: 1 correct + 3 distractors), 30% cloze recall, 20% short answer, 10% scenario application.
  Tag each with scaffolding layer and Bloom''s level. Ensure university-level: active recall, spaced repetition friendly,
  no spoilers in fronts. Prioritize misconceptions (e.g., CK=CPA). End with summary stats: count per Bloom''s/scaffolding.'
