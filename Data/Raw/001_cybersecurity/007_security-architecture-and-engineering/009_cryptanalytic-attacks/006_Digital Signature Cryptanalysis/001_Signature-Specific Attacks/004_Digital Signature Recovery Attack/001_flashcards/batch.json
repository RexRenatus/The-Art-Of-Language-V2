If an attacker knows or can deduce the nonce used for two different signatures made with the same private key, they can often solve for the private key itself, or in some cases, recover the message. This is because the mathematical equations used to generate the signature become solvable when a component is known or predictable, thus enabling recovery or key compromise.",
