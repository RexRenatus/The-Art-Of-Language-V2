However, for randomized signature schemes, an attacker might obtain a valid signature for message 'm' and then generate a *different* valid signature for the *same* message 'm'. sEUF-CMA specifically addresses this 'signature malleability' by ensuring that *any* valid signature must have originated from the legitimate signer, making it a stronger security guarantee.",
