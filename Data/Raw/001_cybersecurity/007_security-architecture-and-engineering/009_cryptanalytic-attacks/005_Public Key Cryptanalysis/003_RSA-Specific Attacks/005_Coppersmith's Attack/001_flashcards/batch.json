        "core_logic": "Coppersmith's attack leverages the power of lattice reduction algorithms, most notably the LLL algorithm, to efficiently find small integer roots of polynomial congruences. These algorithms are designed to find short vectors in a lattice, which directly translates to finding these small roots, thereby enabling the recovery of partial key information or plaintext.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors list other important mathematical algorithms (Euclidean, Extended Euclidean, FFT) that are used in cryptography but are not the primary tool for solving the specific polynomial root problem targeted by Coppersmith's attack.",
        "analogy": "If finding small roots is like finding a specific small number in a complex grid, lattice reduction is like using a specialized tool that can efficiently navigate the grid to find that small number, unlike general tools like a ruler or a basic calculator."
