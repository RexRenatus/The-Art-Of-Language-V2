      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "NIST has officially deprecated SHA-1 for applications requiring collision resistance due to demonstrated practical attacks. Their guidance strongly advises migrating to more secure hash functions like SHA-2 or SHA-3 for all new applications and phasing out SHA-1 from existing ones.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly suggest SHA-1 is still secure, has limited non-security uses, or can be patched with encryption, contradicting NIST's clear deprecation policy.",
        "analogy": "NIST is advising organizations to stop using an old, unreliable lock (SHA-1) for their most valuable assets (digital signatures, certificates) and switch to modern, secure locks (SHA-2, SHA-3)."
