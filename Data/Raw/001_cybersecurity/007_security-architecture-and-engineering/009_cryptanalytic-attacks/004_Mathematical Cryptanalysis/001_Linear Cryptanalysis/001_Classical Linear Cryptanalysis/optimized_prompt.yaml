active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate whether classical linear cryptanalysis poses a real threat to AES today, considering its wide-trail
    design strategy and Matsui's successful DES attack. Provide evidence from bias calculations and required plaintext pairs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

    - Common misconceptions (e.g., bias as p instead of |p-1/2|).
    - Similar concepts (e.g., differential probability vs. linear bias; DES vs. AES attack data).
    - 'Calculation errors (e.g., wrong piling-up: sum vs. product of biases).'
    - Off-by-one or swapped terms (e.g., ciphertext-only vs. known-plaintext).
    - Plausible but incorrect values from research (e.g., 2^47 instead of 2^43 for DES KPs).

  \ cards prompting discussion/peer teaching/problems (e.g., S-box bias calc, toy Feistel attack).\n- Research: Matsui's DES\
  \ attack (2^43 KPs), linear expr P⊕C=K, bias |p-1/2|, piling-up lemma.\n\n**Flashcard Format (JSON array of objects):**\n\
  Each card:\n{\n  \"front\": \"Question/prompt (engaging, active voice)\",\n  \"back\": {\n    \"answer\": \"Concise correct\
