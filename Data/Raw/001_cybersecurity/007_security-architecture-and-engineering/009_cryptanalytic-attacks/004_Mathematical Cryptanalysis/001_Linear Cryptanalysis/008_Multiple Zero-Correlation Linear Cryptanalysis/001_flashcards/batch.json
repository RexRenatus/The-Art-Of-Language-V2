      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Modern, well-studied ciphers like AES have been subjected to intense cryptanalysis, including linear and differential attacks. The challenge for ZCLC researchers is not just to find *any* zero-correlation approximations, but to find ones that provide a significant advantage (e.g., much lower data complexity, ability to attack more rounds) over the already established attacks. This requires deep analysis of AES's specific algebraic structure and potentially novel ways to construct zero-correlation hulls that exploit its unique properties.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The first distractor is incorrect; AES's structure, while complex, has linearizable aspects that ZCLC can target. The second distractor is wrong because ZCLC primarily analyzes the round function and data flow, not the secret key schedule itself. The third distractor reverses the core benefit of ZCLC, which is *reducing* data complexity.",
        "analogy": "Attacking AES with ZCLC is like trying to find a new, faster way to pick a very well-designed, heavily guarded lock. The lock (AES) is already known to be difficult, so simply finding *a* way to pick it isn't enough; you need to find a significantly *better* or fundamentally different method (novel ZCLC hull) to be noteworthy."
