      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Effective security architecture engineering for the quantum threat involves proactive migration to PQC standards (like NIST's ML-KEM/ML-DSA) and building crypto-agility into systems. This allows for easier updates and future transitions, addressing both the immediate threat to RSA and the need for long-term cryptographic resilience.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The first distractor suggests an inadequate defense and passive approach. The second incorrectly assumes symmetric crypto is unaffected and ignores asymmetric vulnerabilities. The third advocates for a dangerous reactive stance, ignoring proactive risks.",
        "analogy": "Building a house in an earthquake zone requires not just stronger materials (PQC) but also a flexible design (crypto-agility) that can be reinforced or adapted if new seismic threats emerge, rather than waiting for the earthquake to hit."
