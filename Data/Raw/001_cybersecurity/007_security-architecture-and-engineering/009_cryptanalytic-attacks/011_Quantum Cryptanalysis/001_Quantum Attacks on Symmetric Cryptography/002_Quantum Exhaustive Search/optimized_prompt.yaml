active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the timeline for quantum computers capable of running Grover's algorithm
    on 128-bit AES keys. Consider current qubit counts, error rates, and NIST timelines—what organizations should prioritize
    PQC migration first, and why?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For multiple-choice cards (20% of total): Generate 3 distractors based on common misconceptions—e.g.,
    (1) Confuse Grover''s quadratic speedup with Shor''s exponential (wrong impact), (2) Incorrect security halving (e.g.,
    128-bit to 128-bit instead of 64-bit), (3) Mix symmetric/asymmetric threats (e.g., claim Grover breaks RSA). Ensure distractors
    are plausible and educational.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Quantum Exhaustive Search\
  \ (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cryptanalytic Attacks > Quantum Cryptanalysis\
  \ > Quantum Attacks on Symmetric Cryptography > Quantum Exhaustive Search).\n\nGenerate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized\
  \ for Anki/Spaced Repetition Systems, covering all Bloom's levels and 4 scaffolding layers. Prioritize active recall with\
  \ cloze deletions (40%), short answer (30%), and multiple choice (30% with distractors).\n\n**Incorporate these elements:**\n\
  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the full 'learning_objectives' array here].\n- Scaffolding: Distribute cards evenly across\
  \ 4 layers: [Insert 'scaffolding' details].\n- Active Learning: End 20% of cards with a tie-in question from [Insert 'active_learning'].\n\
  - Prior Knowledge: Anchor to classical brute-force, AES, Shor vs. Grover distinctions.\n- Completeness: Include NIST IR\
  \ 8413 (PQC migration, double symmetric keys), examples (AES-256 → 128-bit security), PQC algos (Kyber, Dilithium).\n\n\
