active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group, debate the ethical and practical implications of protocol downgrade attacks like POODLE.
    Should websites completely disable SSL 3.0 fallback, even if it breaks legacy devices? Provide pros (e.g., enhanced security),
    cons (e.g., accessibility issues), and alternatives (e.g., HSTS, client-side prioritization).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full array above].

  - Active Learning: [insert full active_learning object above] – link flashcards where relevant.

  - Scaffolding: [insert full scaffolding object above] – generate 5 flashcards per layer, progressing from foundation to
  integration.

  - Prior Knowledge: CBC modes, SSL/TLS handshake, padding.

  - Completeness: NIST SP 800-52 (disable SSLv3, TLS 1.2+), mitigations (HSTS, configs), real-world (CVE-2014-3566, browser
  patches).


  Output 25 flashcards in JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'':
