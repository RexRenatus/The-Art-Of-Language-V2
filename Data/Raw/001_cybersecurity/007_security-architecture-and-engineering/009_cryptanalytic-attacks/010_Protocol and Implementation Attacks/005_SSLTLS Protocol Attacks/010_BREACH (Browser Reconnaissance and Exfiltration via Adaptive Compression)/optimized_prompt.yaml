active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In groups, debate the real-world implications of BREACH: Should web servers universally disable HTTP
    compression to mitigate it, or are performance costs too high? Propose and defend alternative mitigations like secret
    randomization, referencing compression mechanics and side-channel risks.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ (80% of cards): Create 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions - e.g., confuse
    BREACH with CRIME (wrong protocol), misstate size effect (larger instead of smaller on match), mix mitigations (e.g.,
    ''enable compression'' ). Ensure distractors are 1-2 words off from truth, grounded in research context.'

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full array above].

  - Active Learning: [summarize briefly: discussion on mitigations, peer teaching by layers, size-analysis simulation].

  - Scaffolding: Use exactly these 4 layers [paste full scaffolding above], ensuring coverage.


  Generate 25-35 high-quality flashcards following this EXACT schema [paste flashcard_schema above].


  Content Details (from research/voter consensus):

  - BREACH exploits HTTP compression (Gzip/DEFLATE) in HTTPS via side-channel: smaller compressed size when guess matches
  secret (redundancy reduction).

  - Steps: Craft requests with prefix/guess, observe oracle sizes, iterate bytes, align blocks.

  - Mitigations: Disable compression, randomize secrets, padding.

  - Comparisons: CRIME (similar, SPDY), Lucky13 (timing).

  - Sources: Wikipedia, Infosec Institute.


  Balance: 20% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND (Layer 1-2), 30% APPLY (Layer 3), 30% ANALYZE/EVALUATE (Layer 4), 20% CREATE (integration).
  80% MCQ with distractors. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards. Ensure university-level rigor: precise, no fluff, active
  recall focus.'
