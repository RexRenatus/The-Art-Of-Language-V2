active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given the homomorphic properties of encryption schemes like Paillier (PHE) or RLWE-based FHE, debate
    in small groups the ethical implications of exploiting these properties in a scenario where an attacker has access to
    a cloud service performing encrypted computations on sensitive medical data. What mitigations could defenders implement
    to balance privacy benefits and security risks?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
  additional_activities:
  - 'Role-playing: Students act as attackers exploiting side-channels or bit manipulation in HE and defenders proposing HES-compliant
    parameters.'
  - 'Group design challenge: Collaboratively develop a secure HE protocol resistant to homomorphic property exploitation,
    incorporating NIST PQC standards.'

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''FHE has no noise issues''), 2) Confusable
    term (e.g., PHE vs. SHE), 3) Partial truth (e.g., ''Supports multiplication only''). Ensure one correct answer clearly
    superior. Balance Q&A (60%) and MCQ (40%).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  Homomorphic Property Exploitation (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cryptanalytic Attacks
  > Protocol and Implementation Attacks > Bit and Message Manipulation > Homomorphic Property Exploitation). Use this research
  context: Homomorphic Encryption (HE) allows computations on ciphertext. PHE (Paillier additive), SHE (limited depth, noise
  accumulation), FHE (RLWE-based, arbitrary ops). Exploitation via parameter weaknesses, implementation flaws, bit manipulation.
  NIST PQC standardization includes lattice-based (RLWE) for FHE foundations; HES guidelines for secure params. Sources: digitalprivacy.ieee.org,
  eprint.iacr.org (Gentry FHE, Paillier cryptosystem), NIST IR 8413 (HE status).

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following the exact flashcard_schema. Ensure university pedagogy: Bloom''s progression,
  active recall, spaced repetition. Cover all layers/objectives. Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'',
  ''tags'': [''Layer-1'', ''REMEMBER'']}, ...]. Make explanations engaging, with real-world ties (e.g., medical data, voting).
  Distractors from misconceptions (e.g., ''HE is always secure''). No fluff; precise, educational.'
