This requires analyzing a sufficient volume of captured ciphertexts and IVs. In contrast, a brute-force attack would systematically attempt every possible key combination until the correct one is found. For WEP keys, brute-force is generally infeasible due to the key space size, making statistical attacks like PTW far more practical.",

The second distractor is wrong as brute-force is computationally infeasible for strong keys and requires immense effort, unlike PTW's statistical efficiency.
