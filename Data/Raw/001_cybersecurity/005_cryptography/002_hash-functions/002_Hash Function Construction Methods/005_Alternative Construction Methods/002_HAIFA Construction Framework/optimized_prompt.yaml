active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''HAIFA''s wide-pipe design and counter mechanism make
    it superior to Sponge constructions for all hash function use cases.'' Provide evidence from security properties, performance,
    and real-world examples like BLAKE vs. Keccak.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    with MD chaining), (2) Partial truths (e.g., MD padding instead of prefix-free), (3) Related concepts (e.g., Sponge squeezing
    vs. HAIFA FA), (4) Edge cases (e.g., no salt in HAIFA). Ensure distractors are realistic errors from voter suggestions
    or MD weaknesses.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in cryptography. Generate
  high-quality, Anki-optimized flashcards for the topic ''HAIFA Construction Framework'' (topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity >
  001_Cryptography > Hash Functions > 002_Hash Function Construction Methods > Alternative Construction Methods > HAIFA Construction
  Framework). Use this research context: [insert full research_context_summary from JSON].


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [insert full learning_objectives array].

  - Active learning: Tie cards to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving (e.g., ''Use in peer teach: Diagram this step'').

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [insert scaffolding_layers summary].

  - Bloom''s coverage: 30% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 40% Evaluate/Create.


  Follow flashcard schema exactly [insert full flashcard_schema]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcards, each as: {"id":1,

  explanation...", "blooms_level":"Remember", "scaffolding_layer":1, "security_implication":"Prevents length-extension"}.
  Ensure completeness, accuracy (fix NIST irrelevance per voters), active recall, spaced repetition best practices (no cues
  in questions).'
