  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Symmetric keys are always safer than asymmetric keys
    for operational security.'' Use examples from hash functions (e.g., HMAC vs. ECDSA) and NIST SP 800-57 to support arguments,
    considering trade-offs in hygiene practices like storage and destruction.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - '3 distractors per MCQ: 1 common misconception (e.g., ''MD5 for key derivation''), 1 partial truth (e.g., ''5 stages
      only''), 1 unrelated (e.g., ''Firewall config'').'
    - 'Base on real errors: Weak hashes, skipped lifecycle stages, symmetric/asymmetric confusion.'
    - Ensure 1 plausible distractor from adjacent subdomains (e.g., hash collisions without keys).
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Cryptographic Hygiene Practices
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > Hash Functions > 007_Security Considerations and Compliance > 008_Operational
  Security Practices > Cryptographic Hygiene Practices). Use the provided research context (completed: Symmetric keys shared

  4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema.


  Generate high-quality Anki-style flashcards optimized for Bloom''s progression, active recall, and spaced repetition. Incorporate
  university pedagogy: Scaffolding from foundation to integration, voter consensus (completeness, pedagogy, etc.), web-grounded
  accuracy.


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards, each: {"front": "...", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "hints":
  ["..."], "tags": ["..."]}, "bloom_level": "REMEMBER", "layer": "1"}.


  Ensure: Distractors per protocol, measurable outcomes, concept map ties (e.g., lifecycle branches), prerequisites (hash
  basics), big picture (breaches prevented). Cover all objectives/activities/layers comprehensively.'
