active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the security implications of using outdated hash functions like MD5 for file integrity checks
    in modern software distribution systems. What real-world breaches could occur if collision resistance is broken? Reference
    standards like FIPS 180-4 and discuss alternatives like SHA-256.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Topic: Hash-Based Change Detection (Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > Hash Functions > 004_Hash Function Applications > Data Integrity Verification > Hash-Based
  Change Detection). Use this context:


  Research: Hash functions create fixed-size digests for integrity checks (FIPS 180-4: SHA-256 etc.). Properties: collision/pre-image/second
  pre-image resistance. Avalanche effect detects any change. Tools: Tripwire, Git, hashlib. Big picture: CIA Integrity.
