      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "FIM is primarily a detective control because it identifies that a security incident (unauthorized file change) has already occurred by comparing current states to a baseline. While it aids in response, its core function is detection, not prevention or immediate correction.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Preventive controls stop incidents before they happen (e.g., firewalls). Corrective controls fix issues after they occur (e.g., patching). Administrative controls are policies and procedures. FIM detects ongoing or past events.",
        "analogy": "FIM is like a burglar alarm that goes off *after* someone breaks in, alerting you to the intrusion. A preventive control would be a locked door, and a corrective control would be repairing the broken window."
