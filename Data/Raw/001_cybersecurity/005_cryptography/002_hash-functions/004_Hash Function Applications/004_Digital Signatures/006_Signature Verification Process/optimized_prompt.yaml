  - objective: Define key terminology
    verbs:
    - define
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Apply knowledge to scenarios
    verbs:
    - apply
    measurable: true

    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare digital signatures to handwritten signatures in terms of non-repudiation. Debate scenarios where
    one fails over the other, using real-world breaches like SolarWinds supply chain attack—consider how hash tampering could
    mimic forgery.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Base on common misconceptions: e.g., confuse private/public key roles, think hashes alone provide signatures, ignore
      tampering effects, mix integrity/authenticity.'
    - 'Ensure plausibility: Use similar terms (e.g., ''private key for verification''), real errors from breaches (SolarWinds
      hash tampering).'
    - 'Variety: 1 superficial (typo-level), 1 conceptual (role swap), 1 advanced (collision attack).'

    - Cloze deletion (REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND)
    - MCQ (APPLY/ANALYZE)

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy.\
  \ Generate 20-30 high-quality flashcards on 'Signature Verification Process' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography\
  \ > Hash Functions > 004_Hash Function Applications > 006_Digital Signatures > Signature Verification Process). \n\nIncorporate\
  \ these elements:\n- **Learning Objectives** (span Bloom's): [INSERT FULL learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]. Ensure 30% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND,\
  \ 40% APPLY/ANALYZE, 30% EVALUATE/CREATE.\n- **Active Learning** for context: [INSERT FULL active_learning OBJECT HERE].\
  \ Reference in explanations.\n- **Scaffolding Layers**: Build cards progressively from Layer 1 (Foundation) to Layer 4 (Integration)\
  \ [INSERT FULL scaffolding OBJECT HERE].\n- **Prerequisites**: Public-key crypto, hash properties (collision resistance).\n\
  - **Core Process**: 1. Hash message. 2. Decrypt signature (public key) → hash'. 3. Compare. NIST FIPS 186-5 standard.\n\
  - **Real-world**: PGP, HTTPS, GitHub commits, SolarWinds.\n\n**Flashcard Schema** (output each as JSON object):\n[INSERT\
  \ FULL flashcard_schema HERE]. Use MCQ for analysis, cloze for recall, scenarios for create.\n\nGenerate diverse cards:\
  \ 5-7 per Bloom level, covering steps, failures, standards. Ensure distractors follow protocol. Output array of JSON objects.\
  \ No duplicates; optimize for spaced repetition (active recall, interleaved)."
