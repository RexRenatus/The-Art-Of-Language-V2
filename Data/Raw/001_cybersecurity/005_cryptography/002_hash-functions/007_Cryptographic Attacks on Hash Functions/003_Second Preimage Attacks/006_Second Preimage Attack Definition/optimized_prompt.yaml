active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the real-world impact of a successful second preimage attack on protocols
    like digital signatures or blockchain integrity. Why might it be more practical than a first preimage attack in certain
    scenarios? Reference NIST standards and provide examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - 'Common misconceptions: e.g., Confuse with collision (any two messages) or first preimage (any input for hash).'
  - 'Similar concepts: Swap ''second'' with ''first'' or ''collision''; use weak examples that actually demonstrate wrong
    attack.'
  - 'Plausible errors: Reference real hashes incorrectly (e.g., ''SHA-1 vulnerable to second preimage'' – actually collisions).'
  - 'Edge cases: Outputs based on reduced complexity (e.g., 2^128 instead of 2^256 for SHA-256).'
  - 'Balance: 1 superficial (typo-level), 1 conceptual mix-up, 1 advanced trap.'

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Active Learning: Use hooks like ''Discuss in groups...'' or ''Peer-teach this step...'' in explanations.

  - Scaffolding: [insert full scaffolding above] – Tag each card to a layer.

  - Big Picture: Emphasize role in secure protocol design (e.g., NIST SHA-256 approvals).

  - Sources: Cite NIST CSRC, SP 800-106/107.


  Generate flashcards per this schema: [insert full flashcard_schema above]. Output as JSON array of objects, each with ''front''
  (question + options), ''back'' (answer + explanation + tags). Ensure distractors follow protocol. Cover all Bloom''s levels
  progressively, with hands-on examples (toy hash). Make engaging, accurate, and optimized for spaced repetition.'
