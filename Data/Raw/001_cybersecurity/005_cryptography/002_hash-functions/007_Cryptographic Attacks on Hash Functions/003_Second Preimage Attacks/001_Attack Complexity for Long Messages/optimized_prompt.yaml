active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of second preimage attacks on hash functions, why might the computational complexity differ
    for short messages versus very long messages (e.g., spanning millions of blocks)? Debate the practical implications for
    securing large data files like software updates or blockchain ledgers. Consider trade-offs in hash design like Merkle-Damgård
    structure.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2^{n/2} instead of 2^n); 2) Length-dependent error (e.g., 2^{n + log L} or 2^{n - log L}); 3) Off-topic confusion (e.g.,
    first preimage or cipher key size). Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter-noted errors like mixing with collisions
    or ignoring MD structure.'

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert the 6 objectives above]. Ensure flashcards progressively address REMEMBER to CREATE.

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert the 4 layers]. Distribute flashcards: 30% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 20% Layer 4.

  - Active Learning Context: Inspire questions from discussion (long vs short messages), peer teaching (MD attacks), problem-solving
  (SHA-1 calcs).

  - Voter Priorities: Focus on accuracy (generic 2^n, MD long-message ~2^{n/2} via collision trees, refs: Kelsey/Schneier
  2005, Coron/Joux, BSI TR-02102-1); pedagogy (Bloom''s progression); completeness (examples, misconceptions).


  Generate 25 high-quality MCQ flashcards covering all objectives and layers. Use research: Generic second preimage 2^n independent
  of length; MD enables long-message attacks ~2^{n/2} work for exponentially long m''.
