        "core_logic": "TLS exemplifies cryptographic agility by supporting a range of cipher suites and allowing negotiation. This enables clients and servers to select the most secure available algorithm and facilitates upgrades to newer TLS versions, ensuring ongoing security as cryptographic standards evolve.",
        "distractor_analysis": "TLS explicitly supports multiple cipher suites, not just one. Agility involves managed transitions, not immediate disabling. While HSMs can aid security, TLS's agility is primarily a feature of its protocol design and negotiation capabilities.",
        "analogy": "TLS's cryptographic agility is like a universal adapter for international travel. You can plug your device into different outlets (cipher suites/versions) around the world (client/server negotiation), ensuring your device works wherever you go, and you can adapt to new plug types as they emerge."
