active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a constrained IoT environment with limited battery life, debate the trade-offs of using a high-security
    hash like SHA-3 versus a more energy-efficient lightweight hash like Ascon. Consider scenarios where security breaches
    could have high costs—justify your position with metrics like mJ/hash and real-world examples from NIST LWC benchmarks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    cycles/byte instead of mJ/hash); 3) Real but wrong values (e.g., SHA-256 energy as 0.1 mJ instead of 1 mJ); 4) Off-topic
    (e.g., security bits). Ensure 70% plausibility to test discrimination.'
