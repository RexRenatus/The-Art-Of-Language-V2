active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare the security strengths and weaknesses of SHA-1 versus SHA-256 in the context of FIPS 180-4. Why
    was SHA-1 deprecated by NIST (post-2022 transitions), and what implications does this have for legacy systems migrating
    to compliant hashes?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (4 options): 1 correct, 3 plausible distractors.

    - Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., include SHA-3 as FIPS 180-4 algo).

    - Distractor 2: Related but incorrect (e.g., SHA-1 bit length as 256).

    - Distractor 3: Edge case/outdated (e.g., MD5 as approved).

    Ensure distractors teach via wrong-answer feedback. No ''all/none'' options.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST standards. Generate\
  \ a deck of 50-75 high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized flashcards on 'FIPS 180-4 Secure Hash Standard' (Category: Cybersecurity\
