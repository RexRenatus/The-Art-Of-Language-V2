active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages of SHA3-384's sponge construction over SHA-2's Merkle-Damgård
    structure in resisting length-extension attacks. Provide evidence from FIPS 202 and real-world vulnerabilities like SHA-1
    collisions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate plausible distractors based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., SHA3-384 r=1088 instead of
    832, confusing with SHA3-256); 2) Related variants (e.g., SHA3-512 c=1024); 3) SHA-2 params (e.g., 256-bit output); 4)
    Off-by-one errors (e.g., c=832); ensure distractors teach via elimination (e.g., ''matches SHA3-256'').'

  > Hash Functions > 003_Hash Function Algorithms and Standards > SHA-3 Family (FIPS 202) > SHA3-384 Design). Use the provided
  learning objectives, active learning ideas, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema to create optimized Anki-style flashcards.

  Family (FIPS 202) > SHA3-384 Design.


  Incorporate: NIST FIPS 202, KECCAK sponge (b=1600, SHA3-384: r=832, c=768), permutation steps (θ,ρ,π,χ,ι), padding (01 multi-rate),
  phases (absorb/squeeze), contrasts with SHA-2, XOFs, applications.


  Prior Knowledge: Assume basics of hash properties (pre-image/collision resistance) from earlier topics.


  Output EXACTLY a JSON array of 50 flashcards, each as: {"id":1, "front":"Question text", "back":"Answer text", "explanation":"Detailed
  explanation with Bloom''s level, layer, and source.", "type":"cloze/mcq/short", "mcq_options":["A","B","C","D"] if MCQ,
  "scaffolding_layer":"1-4", "bloom_level":"REMEMBER/etc."}. Balance per schema. Ensure active recall, no hints in front,
  distractors plausible. Make explanations formative with feedback.'
