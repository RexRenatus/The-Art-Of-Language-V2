active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the reasons NIST selected KECCAK for SHA-3 over other candidates. How does
    SHA3-512's sponge construction address vulnerabilities in SHA-2, such as length-extension attacks? Connect to real-world
    implications for blockchain or password security.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Use this optimized pedagogy:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert the ''learning_objectives'' array above].

  - Active Learning: Incorporate elements from [discussion_prompt, peer_teaching_activity, problem_solving_exercise] into
  application cards.

  - Scaffolding: Strictly layer content as [insert the ''scaffolding'' array above], progressing from foundation to integration.

  - Research Context: SHA3-512 (512-bit hash, KECCAK sponge, FIPS 202). Properties: deterministic, resistances. Differs from
  SHA-2 (no length-extension). Best practices: data integrity (checksums), passwords (salted), signatures. Sources: NIST FIPS
  202, KECCAK.team.


  Generate flashcards per exact ''flashcard_schema'' above. Ensure university-level: Bloom''s progression, active recall,
  misconceptions addressed via distractors/explanations. Voter priorities: Completeness (best practices, sources), pedagogy
  (assessments), scaffolding, higher Bloom''s, knowledge integration (SHA-2 links), concept map.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 25-35 flashcards, e.g., [{''type'': ''mcq'', ''front'': ''...'', ...}]. No additional text.'
