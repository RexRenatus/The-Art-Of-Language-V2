  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the cryptographic evolution from MD4 to modern standards like SHA-256:
    Why was MD4 deprecated after collisions were found in 1995? How do its vulnerabilities (e.g., weak round functions) inform
    best practices for selecting hash functions in digital signatures today? Support with evidence from RFC 1320.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Cryptography > Hash Functions
  > MD4 Algorithm Design (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > Hash Functions > 003_Hash Function Algorithms
  and Standards > MD Family Algorithms > MD4 Algorithm Design).


  Generate 20 high-quality flashcards (12 basic Q/A, 8 MCQ) covering all Bloom''s objectives, active learning activities,
  and 4 scaffolding layers. Prioritize completeness: full MD4 details (padding, init vectors A=0x67452301 etc., F/G/H funcs,
  48 steps, T constants, pseudocode elements, vulnerabilities per research context from RFC 1320).


  Incorporate:

  - Prior knowledge: hash properties, bitwise ops.

  - Vulnerabilities: collisions 1995, deprecation.


  Use exact flashcard schema: Output array of JSON objects as specified. Ensure distractors follow protocol. Each card ties
  to one objective/layer with full explanations. Make questions active/recall-oriented for spaced repetition.'
