active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: MD2 was designed for efficient digital signatures in the early 1990s but is now obsolete due to vulnerabilities
    like practical collision attacks. Debate the trade-offs between efficiency and security in hash functions, comparing MD2
    to modern alternatives like SHA-256. What lessons from MD2's deprecation can inform future algorithm design and crypto
    hygiene?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in cryptography. Generate
  high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for ''MD2 Algorithm Specifications'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography
  > Hash Functions > 003_Hash Function Algorithms and Standards > MD Family Algorithms > MD2 Algorithm Specifications). Use
  the provided learning_objectives (span Bloom''s: remember to create), active_learning components (embed discussion/problem
  hooks), scaffolding layers (cover all 4 progressively), and flashcard_schema (mix types, follow distractor_protocol).


  Context: MD2 (RFC 1319, obsoleted RFC 6149) produces 128-bit digest for digital signatures. Padding: to 16-byte multiples
  + length mod 256. State: 48 bytes (X,C,M). Per block: 3 passes. 18 mixing rounds with S-box. Vulns: collisions (2004). Alternatives:
  SHA-256. Prerequisites: hash properties, signatures.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"type": "basic/cloze/multiple_choice", "front": "...", "back": "Answer\nExplanation:
  ... (Bloom: LEVEL, Layer: #, Source: RFC1319)", "tags": ["MD2", "hash", "cybersec"]}. Balance: 40-60 cards, 25% MC. Ensure
  active recall, no hints in front. Voter priorities: pedagogy (objectives, discussion), completeness (vulns, best practices),
  problem-solving.'
