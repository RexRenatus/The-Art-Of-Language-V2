active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'Evaluate the trade-offs of setting a high work factor (e.g., 500ms per hash) in a high-traffic web app:
    security gains vs. potential DoS from legitimate users during peak times. Propose mitigations such as adaptive tuning
    or rate limiting.'
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains work factor to their partner using analogies (e.g., like a toll booth slowing
    traffic to prevent pile-ups). The partner teaches back using a hand-drawn diagram, then switch roles.
  problem_solving: Given server specs (4 CPU cores, expected 100 logins/sec legitimate traffic), calculate and test an optimal
    work factor to withstand 10k fake login attempts/min without exceeding 50% CPU usage. Use Python with bcrypt library to
    benchmark and simulate.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''DoS Prevention via Work
  Factor Limits'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > Hash Functions > 005_Password Hashing and Key Derivation
  > Work Factor and Performance Tuning > DoS Prevention via Work Factor Limits). Focus on application-layer DoS prevention
  via password hashing work factors (bcrypt cost, Argon2 iterations/memory, PBKDF2 rounds), NOT volumetric DDoS. Use accurate
  crypto context from OWASP Password Storage Cheat Sheet, bcrypt/Argon2 docs.


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert full list above]

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to activities (e.g., Qs on trade-offs for discussions).


  Generate exactly 50 high-quality flashcards following this exact schema: [insert full flashcard_schema.structure above].
  Strictly adhere to distractor protocol.


  Ensure:

  - University pedagogy: Progress from remember to create.

  - Voter accuracy: Emphasize auth endpoint protection, computational asymmetry.

  - Engagement: Include analogies (toll booth), code examples, trade-offs.

  - Output ONLY a JSON array of 50 flashcards, e.g., [{''id'':1, ...}, ...]. No extra text.'
