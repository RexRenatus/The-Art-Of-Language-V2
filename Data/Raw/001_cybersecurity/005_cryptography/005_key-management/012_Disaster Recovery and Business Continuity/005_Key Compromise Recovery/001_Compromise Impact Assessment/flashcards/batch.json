This strategy functions by designing systems with modular cryptographic components and flexible key management, connecting to proactive security and risk management.",

Instead of just having one type of screwdriver (one algorithm/key system), you have various tools that allow you to quickly switch to the right one if a particular tool breaks or is insufficient for a new task (compromise)."
