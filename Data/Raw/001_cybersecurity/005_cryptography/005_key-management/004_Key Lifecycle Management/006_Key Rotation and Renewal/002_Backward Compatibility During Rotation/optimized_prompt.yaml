active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of prioritizing rapid cryptographic rotation for security
    versus maintaining backward compatibility to avoid service disruptions in legacy systems. Reference NIST guidelines and
    real-world examples like TLS 1.2 to 1.3 upgrades, and propose mitigations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 20-30 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema provided. Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full list above].

  - Active Learning: Inspire cards that prep for discussions (e.g., risk trade-offs), peer teaching (mechanism explanations),
  problem-solving (scenarios).

  - Scaffolding: Prioritize prior knowledge; structure cards by 4 layers [paste layers]; include textual concept map links.

  - Research: NIST SP 800-57 (key lifecycle), SP 800-131A Rev. 2 (transitions), crypto-agility def, examples (TLS 1.2→1.3,
  SHA-1→SHA-256).

  - Best Practices: University pedagogy (Bloom''s progression), active recall, spaced repetition; measurable outcomes (quizzes
  for remember/apply, rubrics for create).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each matching the schema: {''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': 1-4, ''distractors'': [''d1'', ''d2'', ''d3'']}. Ensure distractors follow
  protocol. Balance coverage: objectives, layers, real-world apps, mechanisms (dual-key, negotiation, rollout).'
