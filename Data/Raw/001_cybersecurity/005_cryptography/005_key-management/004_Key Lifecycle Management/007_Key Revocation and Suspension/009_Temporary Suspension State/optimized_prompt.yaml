  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the following: ''When investigating a potential key compromise, is temporary
    suspension always preferable to revocation? Provide examples from NIST SP 800-57 and real-world incidents, considering
    recovery time, operational impact, and compliance requirements.'' Encourage participants to reference key states and triggers.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (partial truth, e.g., ''always permanent''), 3) Contextual (wrong trigger/source, e.g., ''only for expiration''). Ensure
    plausible for learners at foundation/mid-layers; base on voter-noted misconceptions (e.g., confusing suspension with revocation).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in cryptographic key management.
  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on ''Temporary Suspension State'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography
  > 006_Key Management > 003_Key Lifecycle Management > Key Revocation and Suspension > Temporary Suspension State). Base
  content strictly on NIST SP 800-57 Part 1: Temporary Suspension State is a reversible administrative state where key use
  is halted (e.g., suspected compromise), material retained until cleared; distinct from permanent revocation.

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert full scaffolding above]

  - Active Learning: Tie explanations to discussion/activities.


  Use Flashcard Schema:

  - Output as JSON array: [{''id'':1, ''type'':''MCQ/ShortAnswer'', ''bloom_level'':''Remember'', ''layer'':''1'', ''front'':''Question'',
  ''back'':{''answer'':''...'', ''explanation'':''...'', ''distractors'':[''A'',''B'',''C''], ''hints'':[''...'']}}]

  - 50% MCQ (4 options, 1 correct), 50% Short Answer/Cloze.

  - Distractors: Follow protocol.

  - Ensure progression: 10 cards/layer, spanning Bloom''s.

  - Context: Voters emphasize completeness (defs, triggers, diffs, procedures); no criminal content.


  Optimize for Anki/Quizlet: Active recall, spaced repetition, pedagogical depth.'
