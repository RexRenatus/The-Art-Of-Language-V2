active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and debate the key differences between FIPS 140-2 and FIPS 140-3 in terms of key generation requirements
    (e.g., RNGs, entropy sources). Which version better addresses modern threats like quantum computing? Support with evidence
    from NIST sources.
  peer_teaching: Students pair up; one explains the CMVP validation process for a cryptographic module (including security
    levels and key management areas), the other teaches back using a hand-drawn diagram. Switch roles and provide feedback.
  problem_solving: 'Present a real-world scenario: A company''s key generation software uses a weak RNG and non-approved entropy
    sources, failing FIPS compliance. In groups, identify violations, reference specific FIPS 140-3 sections, and design compliant
    fixes integrating NIST SP 800-57.'

  Incorporate this research context: FIPS 140-2 (2001, legacy) and FIPS 140-3 (2019, current, aligns with ISO/IEC 19790:2012)
  validate cryptographic modules (hardware/software/firmware for crypto functions) via CMVP (NIST/Canadian program). Security
  levels 1-4 cover physical security, key management (generation with approved RNGs/DRBGs, entropy sources), roles/services.
  Key gen requires Annex A/C algorithms, conditioning. Relevant for SBU/CUI; links to NIST SP 800-57. Sources: csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/140-3/final,
