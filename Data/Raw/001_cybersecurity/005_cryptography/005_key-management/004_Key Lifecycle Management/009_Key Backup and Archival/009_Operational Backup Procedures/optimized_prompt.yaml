active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In key lifecycle management, how should organizations balance Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery
    Point Objective (RPO) when designing operational backup procedures for cryptographic keys? Discuss trade-offs with real-world
    examples like ransomware attacks on HSMs or key compromise incidents.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: (1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse RTO with RPO), (2) Plausible
    but incomplete/general IT practice (e.g., unencrypted backups), (3) Extreme/overly secure option irrelevant to scenario
    (e.g., air-gapped for low-risk keys). Ensure distractors test nuance in crypto key contexts like HSMs vs. file backups.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in cryptographic key management.
  Topic: Operational Backup Procedures (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 006_Key Management > 003_Key Lifecycle
  Management > Key Backup and Archival > Operational Backup Procedures). Focus exclusively on cryptographic key backups (NIST
  SP 800-57 Part 1 Section 8.1.6, SP 800-53 SC-12/CP-9 tailored to keys: key wrapping, split knowledge, HSMs, tamper-evident
  storage, recovery testing). Avoid general IT backups unless tied to keys.


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]. Ensure flashcards test across all levels.

  - Scaffolding: Build from Layer 1 (definitions: RTO/RPO, key backup) to Layer 4 (integration: testing/HSM recovery).

  - Active Learning Tie-ins: Include flashcards inspired by discussion (RTO/RPO trade-offs), peer teaching (NIST controls),
  problem-solving (HSM failure scenarios).

  ["...","...","..."], "bloom_level": "...", "scaffolding_layer": #, "references": "..."}}. Vary formats, ensure accuracy
  to NIST, use distractor protocol for misconceptions (e.g., ignoring key-specific encryption).'
