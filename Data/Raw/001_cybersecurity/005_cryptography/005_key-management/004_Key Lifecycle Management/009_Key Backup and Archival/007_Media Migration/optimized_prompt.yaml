active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between Cryptographic Erase, Secure Erase, and physical destruction for migrating
    keys from HDD to SSD in a financial institution. Which method best balances cost, time, and security? Support your position
    with references to NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1 and the CIA triad.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Spaced Repetition. Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy
  objectives [insert learning_objectives array here], active learning [insert active_learning object here], 4-layer scaffolding
  [insert scaffolding object here]. Use NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1 (2012) exclusively for accuracy.


  Follow flashcard_schema exactly: Output as JSON array of objects, each with ''front'' and ''back'' (containing ''answer'',
  ''explanation'', ''active_learning_link'', ''references''). Ensure 20% MCQs with distractors per protocol. Cover all layers
  progressively: 25% Layer1, 25% Layer2, 25% Layer3, 25% Layer4. Balance Bloom''s levels per objectives. Prioritize key archival/migration
  contexts (e.g., crypto erase for keys on HDD/SSD/tape to cloud). Include prior knowledge links (encryption/key storage)
  and big picture (secure lifecycle during upgrades).


  Make explanations 2-4 sentences, actionable, misconception-proof. Questions testable/measurable. No spoilers on front. Output
  only valid JSON.'
