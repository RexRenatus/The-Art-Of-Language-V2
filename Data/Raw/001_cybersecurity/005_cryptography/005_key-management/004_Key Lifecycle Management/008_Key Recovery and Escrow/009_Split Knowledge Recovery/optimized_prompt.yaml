active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using split knowledge for key recovery in high-stakes
    environments like blockchain multi-signature wallets versus traditional enterprise HSMs. Consider security benefits, recovery
    time, and potential for insider threats, referencing NIST SP 800-57 Part 1.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate plausible distractors based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''One share can reconstruct''),
    2) Partial truths (e.g., mix NIST parts), 3) Edge cases (e.g., non-threshold schemes), 4) Real-world confusions (e.g.,
    confuse with key rotation). Ensure distractors are 70-80% similar to correct answer for challenge.'

  **Topic Context:** Split knowledge divides a cryptographic secret (e.g., key) into parts where no single part suffices for
  reconstruction, enabling secure recovery via threshold schemes like Shamir''s Secret Sharing (M-of-N). NIST SP 800-57 (Parts
  1-3) mandates it to avoid single-point failures. Full sources: NIST SP 800-57 Pt1 r5 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/57/pt1/r5/final),
  Pt2 r5, Pt3; FIPS 140-3; Shamir 1979.


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list from above].

  - Scaffolding: Generate cards balanced across 4 layers [insert summaries].

  - Active Learning: Tie explanations to discussion/peer teaching/problems.

  - Bloom''s Coverage: 30% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 40% Evaluate/Create.


  **Generation Rules:**

  - Use schema: MCQ (1 correct, 3 distractors per protocol).

  - Content: Factual, NIST-grounded, include real-world (HSMs, blockchain), misconceptions.

  - Output: Array of 25 JSON flashcards, each with ''front'', ''back'', ''bloom_level'', ''scaffolding_layer''.

  - Ensure progressive difficulty, no repetition.
