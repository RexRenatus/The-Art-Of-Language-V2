active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether the pre-activation state poses greater risks than the active usage phase
    in key management, using NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 as reference. Categorize risks (e.g., exposure during storage/distribution)
    and propose mitigations (e.g., HSM usage, dual control).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
