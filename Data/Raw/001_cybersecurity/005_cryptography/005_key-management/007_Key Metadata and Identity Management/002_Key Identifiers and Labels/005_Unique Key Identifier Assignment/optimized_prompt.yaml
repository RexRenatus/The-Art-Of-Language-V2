active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate whether UUIDs alone are sufficient for key identification in high-security environments or if
    additional metadata (e.g., key type, usage period) is necessary. Reference RFC 9562 for UUID generation methods and NIST
    SP 800-57 for key management guidelines. Consider trade-offs in auditing and collision prevention.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    examples:
    - 'Misconception: UUIDs require central authority (distractor: ''Central registry needed'').'
    - 'Version confusion: ''UUID v4 is time-based'' vs. random.'
    - 'Overstatement: ''UUIDs guarantee 100% uniqueness forever'' (add probability nuance).'
    - 'Irrelevant standard: Mix NIST SP 800-133 with non-key contexts.'
    - Generate 3-4 per MCQ; randomize order; ensure ~70% difficulty via subtle errors.

  **Topic Summary (Web-grounded):** UUIDs/GUIDs (RFC 9562, 128-bit hex) uniquely identify cryptographic keys in key management
  (NIST SP 800-57/800-133). Versions: v1 (time+node), v4 (random, high entropy), v5 (hash). Best practices: Use v4 for distributed
  systems to prevent collisions (~2^-122 prob), integrate with lifecycle (gen/dist/rotate/revoke). Big picture: Enables auditing/secure
  ops in AWS KMS/Azure Key Vault.
