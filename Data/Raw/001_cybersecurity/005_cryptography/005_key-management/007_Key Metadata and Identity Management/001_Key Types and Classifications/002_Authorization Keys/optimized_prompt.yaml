active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast symmetric and asymmetric authorization keys in terms of security, performance, and
    use cases for enterprise systems versus IoT devices. Debate which is better for high-scale IoT deployments and why, citing
    NIST SP 800-57 best practices.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - '3-4 plausible distractors per MCQ, based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse authorization with authentication:
      ''Verify user identity'' instead of ''Grant permissions''; symmetric/asymmetric mixups; passwords vs. keys; incomplete
      lifecycle stages).'
    - Draw from research context and voter suggestions (e.g., authz/authn mixup, NIST misquotes).
    - Ensure distractors are realistic errors from real-world (e.g., AWS IAM confusion).
    examples:
    - 'Q: Primary function of authorization key? Correct: Grant permissions post-authentication. Distractors: Verify identity
      (authn), Encrypt data only, Store hashed passwords.'

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST HERE]

  - Active Learning: Use elements in explanations (e.g., reference discussion debates or scenarios).

  - Scaffolding: 4 Layers [PASTE FULL DETAILS HERE]; tag each card with layer.

  - Topic Details: Definitions (crypto keys for authz), Types (symmetric/asymmetric), Lifecycle (per NIST SP 800-57 Part 1
  Rev. 5: generation/distribution/rotation/revocation/storage/destruction), Security Services (confidentiality/integrity/authorization/non-repudiation),
  Examples (AWS IAM, OAuth/JWT, Kubernetes), Best Practices (HSMs, rotation policies). Prerequisites: Basic crypto/key types.

  - Concept Map: Central Authorization Keys → Types/Lifecycle/Standards.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly [PASTE FULL SCHEMA HERE]. Output 25 flashcards as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'':
