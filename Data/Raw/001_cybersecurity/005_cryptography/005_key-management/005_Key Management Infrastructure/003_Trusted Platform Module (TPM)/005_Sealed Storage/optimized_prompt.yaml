  Research context: Sealed storage in TPM encrypts data with keys bound to PCR values for platform integrity (TCG TPM 2.0:
  TPM2_Seal/Unseal). Differs from generic encryption (e.g., NIST SP 800-38E RMAC is unrelated modes; key mgmt per NIST SP
  800-57 Part 1 Rev. 5). Examples: BitLocker TPM protector, tpm2-tools. Risks: PCR rollback. Sources: TCG specs, NIST publications.
