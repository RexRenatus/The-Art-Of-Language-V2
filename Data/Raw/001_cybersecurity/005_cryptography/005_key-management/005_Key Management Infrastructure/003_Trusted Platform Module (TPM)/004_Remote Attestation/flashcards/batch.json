        "core_logic": "The primary risk of flawed attestation is a false positive: a compromised system successfully convinces the verifier it is trustworthy. This happens because the attestation evidence is manipulated or the verification process is bypassed, leading to security breaches.",
        "distractor_analysis": "While data leakage is a concern in security, it's not the primary risk of *incorrect attestation*. Attestation relies on strong crypto; brute-forcing keys is unlikely if implemented correctly. False rejection is an operational issue, but false acceptance is the critical security failure.",
        "analogy": "It's like a security guard accepting a fake ID. The fake ID (compromised system's false attestation) fools the guard (verifier), allowing unauthorized access."

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Confidential Computing protects data in use via Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Remote Attestation is crucial because it allows a party to verify that the TEE is genuine and correctly configured *before* entrusting sensitive data to it, thus enabling trust in the Confidential Computing setup.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Confidential Computing protects data during processing, not attestation. RA is a complementary technology, not a type of CC. While TEEs (used in CC) often leverage hardware roots of trust (like TPMs), RA is the process of verifying that environment.",
        "analogy": "Confidential Computing is like a secure, private room (TEE) where sensitive work can be done. Remote Attestation is like the security check at the door of that room, ensuring it's safe and properly set up before you enter with your valuable documents."
