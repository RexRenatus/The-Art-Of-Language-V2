active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the trade-offs of implementing HSM clustering for high availability in a financial institution
    (e.g., high compliance needs like PCI DSS and GDPR) versus a small startup (e.g., cost and complexity constraints): Discuss
    security risks, key replication challenges, and examples from AWS CloudHSM or on-premises setups. Provide real-world justifications
    and counterarguments.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    with performance/speed; (2) Mix up with cost-reduction or simplification; (3) Reference unrelated concepts (e.g., data
    centers vs. modules for FIPS; cloud-only vs. hybrid). Ensure distractors are realistic from industry contexts (e.g., AWS
    vs. on-prem errors).'

  Generate 20-30 high-quality flashcards optimized for university-level pedagogy using Bloom''s Taxonomy (REMEMBER to CREATE),
  active learning (discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving), and 4-layer scaffolding:


  **Layer 1 (Foundation):** Basic terms: HSM, cluster, HA, redundancy, AZs; FIPS 140 standards.

  **Layer 2 (Components):** Primary/backup HSMs, sync protocols, quorum.

  **Layer 3 (Implementation):** AWS CloudHSM setup steps, failover procedures.

  **Layer 4 (Integration):** Key mgmt systems, PCI DSS/GDPR compliance (HA ensures continuous keys for data protection), cloud
  vs. on-prem trade-offs, compromise handling.


  Incorporate learning objectives: [insert full list from JSON]. Active learning hooks: [insert summaries from JSON].


  Use this schema strictly for output (JSON array of cards):

  [flashcard_schema.structure details here, verbatim]. Follow distractor protocol exactly. Ensure GDPR relevance (e.g., HA
  for uninterrupted key ops in data protection). Sources: AWS.amazon.com/CloudHSM, Fortanix.com, PaloAltoNetworks.com.


  Distribute cards: 30% Layer 1 (REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND), 30% Layer 2-3 (APPLY/ANALYZE), 40% Layer 4 (EVALUATE/CREATE). Vary
  types: 40% MCQ, 20% True/False, 20% Definition, 20% Application. Output only valid JSON array.'
