active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios would you choose PKCS#11 over other cryptographic APIs like KMIP or MS-CAPI, and what
    are the trade-offs in terms of portability, performance, and security? Discuss real-world applicability and common misconceptions
    about API standardization.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Base on common misconceptions: e.g., PKCS#11 confused with PKCS#12; sessions as stateless; KMIP as hardware API.'
    - 'Use near-misses: Similar function names (C_OpenSession vs. C_CloseAllSessions), versions (v2.20 vs. v3.1), standards
      (RSA vs. OASIS).'
    - 'Incorporate voter examples: Invalid PIN errors, stateful pitfalls.'
    - Ensure 1-2 distractors from lower layers, 1 from integration trade-offs.
    - 'Balance difficulty: 60% Remember/Understand, 25% Apply/Analyze, 15% Evaluate/Create.'
    quantity: 'Generate 50-100 flashcards: 20% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 30% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in PKCS#11 Interface (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 006_Key Management > 006_004_Key Management Infrastructure > Hardware Security
  Modules (HSM) > PKCS#11 Interface). Use the provided learning objectives (Bloom''s Taxonomy), active learning activities,
  4 scaffolding layers, prior knowledge (crypto basics, HSMs, APIs), big picture (KMI/FIPS), and research context (OASIS PKCS#11
  v3.1, Cryptoki for HSMs/tokens/sessions/objects, functions like C_Initialize/C_OpenSession/C_CreateObject/C_Sign, NIST SP
  800-57/FIPS 140-3).


  Generate 75 high-quality flashcards following the exact flashcard_schema. Ensure progression: scaffold from Layer 1 foundations
  to Layer 4 integration. Distractors per protocol for active recall. Tie explanations to objectives/activities (e.g., ''Relates
  to Evaluate objective and fintech problem-solving''). Vary types: 40% MCQ, 30% cloze, 20% short answer, 10% scenario-based.
  Promote deep understanding, misconceptions correction, and real-world application. Output ONLY as JSON array per schema.'
