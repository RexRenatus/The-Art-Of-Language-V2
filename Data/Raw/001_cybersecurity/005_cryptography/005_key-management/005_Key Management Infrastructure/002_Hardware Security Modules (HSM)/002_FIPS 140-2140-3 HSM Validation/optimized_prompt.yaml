active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare FIPS 140-2 Level 3 and FIPS 140-3 Level 3 requirements for physical security in HSMs (e.g., tamper-evident
    mechanisms, side-channel protections). Debate whether organizations should prioritize migration to 140-3 despite legacy
    140-2 validations, considering cost, regulatory compliance, and evolving threats like quantum risks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Topic Context (Research Summary):** FIPS 140-2/140-3 are NIST standards validating cryptographic modules like HSMs (hardware
  for secure key ops). CMVP (NIST/CCCS) oversees labs testing security levels 1-4 (Level 3/4: tamper-resistant for HSMs, side-channel
  protection). Key differences: 140-3 (current) aligns with ISO/IEC 19790:2012 (modular, updated algos, better interfaces);
  140-2 sunsetting. Validation: Design > Accredited lab tests (physical, crypto, env.) > CMVP cert. HSM reqs: Tamper detection,
  zeroization, roles. Best practices: Migrate to 140-3 for finance/cloud KMI. Refs: NIST FIPS 140-3 (SP 800-140 series), CMVP.nist.gov.
