active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the security, compliance, performance, and cost trade-offs of implementing XKS versus AWS-managed
    CMKs for a financial institution processing sensitive customer data under GDPR and PCI-DSS. Which approach better ensures
    key sovereignty? Support arguments with references to AWS documentation and NIST SP 800-57 key management guidelines.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains the role and architecture of the XKS Proxy (including request translation
    and security boundaries), while the partner takes notes and asks clarifying questions; then switch roles and teach about
    Envelope Encryption with XKS, emphasizing how the root key remains in the External Key Manager.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A healthcare provider migrating to AWS must ensure HIPAA compliance with keys never leaving
    their on-prem HSM. Design an XKS-based architecture, including proxy setup, failover mechanisms, and integration with
    S3 encryption. Identify potential single points of failure (e.g., proxy availability) and propose mitigations (e.g., multi-AZ
    deployment).'

  Core Content (from AWS Docs/Blogs/NIST SP 800-57): XKS is a custom KMS keystore backed by customer-controlled External Key
  Manager (e.g., HSM). XKS Proxy (customer software) translates KMS requests—no direct AWS access (HYOK). Supports Envelope
  Encryption (external root key encrypts DEK). Sources: docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/keystore-external.html;
  aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-aws-kms-external-key-store-xks/; NIST SP 800-57 (key isolation).
