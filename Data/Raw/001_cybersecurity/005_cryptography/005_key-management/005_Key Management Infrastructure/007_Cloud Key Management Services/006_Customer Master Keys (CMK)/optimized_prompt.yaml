active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using CMK versus service-managed keys in a multi-tenant
    SaaS application. Consider factors like security (e.g., per-tenant isolation), compliance (e.g., ISO/IEC 11770), operational
    overhead, and zero-trust architecture. Provide evidence from cloud providers like AWS KMS or Azure Key Vault.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use for inspiration (e.g., discussion trade-offs in explanations).

  - Scaffolding: Generate 7-12 flashcards per layer [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM ABOVE]. Tag each with layer and Bloom''s
  level.

  - Prior Knowledge: Link to AES/symmetric encryption basics.

  - Content Sources: Web research (CMK defs, synonyms: BYOK/EKM/CYOK/CHEK/HYOK; per-tenant encryption, key lifecycle, crypto-shredding);
  Cloud examples (AWS KMS CMKs, Azure BYOK, Google EKM); Standards (ISO/IEC 11770); Big Picture (zero-trust, multi-tenant
  isolation).

  - Concept Map: Central ''CMK'' → ''Key Lifecycle'', ''BYOK/EKM'', ''Per-Tenant Encryption'' → prerequisites ''Encryption
  Basics''.


  Generate 30-50 flashcards following this EXACT schema [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD_SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Output as JSON array: [{''type'':
