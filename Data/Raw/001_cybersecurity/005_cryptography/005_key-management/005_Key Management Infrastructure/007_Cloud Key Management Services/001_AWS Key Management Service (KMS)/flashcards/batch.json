        "core_logic": "AWS owned keys are managed by AWS services, offering convenience and ease of use, but at the cost of direct customer control over their lifecycle and permissions. This is a trade-off for simplified, automated data protection, especially for encryption-by-default scenarios.",
        "distractor_analysis": "AWS owned keys are generally free and designed for easy sharing. They are not automatically deleted after a short period.",
        "analogy": "AWS owned keys are like a public utility's water supply. It's readily available and managed for you, but you can't control when the water is turned on or off at the source, or how it's processed before reaching you."

        "core_logic": "KMS provides foundational cryptographic controls required by standards like PCI DSS and HIPAA. Its ability to manage keys securely, encrypt data, and integrate with AWS CloudTrail for auditing helps organizations meet the stringent data protection and accountability requirements of these regulations.",
        "distractor_analysis": "KMS provides tools, but compliance requires proper configuration and broader security practices. There are no pre-configured compliance keys. Compliance involves more than just encryption.",
        "analogy": "Meeting compliance standards with KMS is like using a high-security lock (KMS encryption) on your vault. The lock is essential, but you also need procedures for who has the key, how it's stored, and who witnesses its use (audit trails and policies) to satisfy the overall security regulations."
