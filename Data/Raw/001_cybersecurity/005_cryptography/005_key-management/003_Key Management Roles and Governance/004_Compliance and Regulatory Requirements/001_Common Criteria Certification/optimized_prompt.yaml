active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how Common Criteria certification (e.g., via FCS_CKM modules) strengthens
    key management roles and governance compared to other standards like FIPS. Reference real-world regulatory requirements
    and provide examples of EAL selection trade-offs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Common Criteria Certification\
  \ within the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 006_Key Management > 006_002_Key Management Roles and Governance\
  \ > 012_Compliance and Regulatory Requirements > Common Criteria Certification.\n\nIncorporate these pedagogical elements:\n\
  - Bloom's Taxonomy objectives: [insert full learning_objectives array here]\n- Active learning: Tie flashcards to discussion/peer\
  \ teaching/problem-solving where noted.\n- Scaffolding: Distribute across 4 layers [insert full scaffolding_layers here];\
  \ tag each card with layer.\n- Voter consensus: Emphasize full certification process (TOE sponsor → ST dev → lab eval →\
  \ validation), FCS_CKM links, concept map (TOE/ST/PP/EALs → Key Mgmt), completeness on best practices.\n- Research: Use\
  \ definitions (TOE=IT product; ST=security claims doc; PP=reqs for category; EALs=1-7 rigor). CC=ISO/IEC 15408; CCRA recognition.\n\
  \nGenerate flashcards per schema: [insert full flashcard_schema here]. Ensure web-grounded accuracy, prior knowledge links\
