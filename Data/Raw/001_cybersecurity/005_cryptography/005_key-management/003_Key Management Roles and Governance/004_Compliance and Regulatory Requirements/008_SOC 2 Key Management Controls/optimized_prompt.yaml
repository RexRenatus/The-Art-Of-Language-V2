active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given NIST SP 800-57 guidelines, debate whether symmetric or asymmetric key management poses greater
    compliance risks in SOC 2 audits for a cloud service provider. Support arguments with regulatory examples, trade-offs
    in key secrecy, and real-world breach cases like Code Spaces.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    keys as secret); 2) Partial truths (e.g., symmetric keys for encryption only, ignoring decryption); 3) Confusions with
    related concepts (e.g., mixing lifecycle stages like revocation with destruction); 4) Real-world errors (e.g., breaches
    from poor governance). Ensure distractors are realistic for SOC 2 auditors or cybersecurity pros.'
