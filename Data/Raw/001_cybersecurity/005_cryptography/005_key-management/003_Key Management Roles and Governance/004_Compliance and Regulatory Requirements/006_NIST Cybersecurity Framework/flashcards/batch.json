      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "A key compromise means that the security of the key itself has been breached, leading to a loss of confidentiality (unauthorized disclosure) or integrity (unauthorized modification). This allows attackers to potentially decrypt protected data or impersonate legitimate users, undermining the entire cryptographic system.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Accidental deletion affects availability, not necessarily compromise. Misuse is a policy violation, but compromise implies a breach of the key's security. Expiration is a planned lifecycle event, not a compromise.",
        "analogy": "A key compromise is like losing your house keys. If someone finds them, they can potentially enter your house (breach confidentiality) or even make copies (breach integrity), which is different from simply misplacing them temporarily or having them expire."
