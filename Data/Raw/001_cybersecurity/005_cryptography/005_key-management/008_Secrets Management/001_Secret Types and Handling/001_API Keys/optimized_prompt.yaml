active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether API keys should be phased out in favor of token-based authentication
    like OAuth, using NIST SP 800-57 and SP 800-228 guidelines as evidence. Discuss trade-offs for rate limiting, simplicity,
    and attack surface reduction.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  API Keys.


  Generate 25-30 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema provided below. Cover these learning objectives across Bloom''s
  Taxonomy: [INSERT LEARNING OBJECTIVES HERE]. Distribute across scaffolding layers: [INSERT SCAFFOLDING_LAYERS HERE]. Incorporate
  active learning ties where relevant: [INSERT ACTIVE_LEARNING HERE].


  Base content on research: API keys as bearer credentials for auth/rate limiting; NIST SP 800-57 (key lifecycle), SP 800-228
  (API sec taxonomy); best practices (rotation, vaults, least privilege, monitoring, revocation, secret scanning per Google
  Cloud/NIST); comparisons to OAuth; risks (leaks, attack surface). Sources: TechTarget (API key def), Google Cloud (best
  practices: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys), NIST SP 800-57 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r5.pdf),
  NIST SP 800-228.


  Use this exact FLASHCARD SCHEMA: [INSERT FLASHCARD_SCHEMA HERE]. Ensure distractors are plausible misconceptions. Output
  as a numbered JSON array of objects, each with ''front'' and ''back'' keys. Make educational, precise, and progressive.'
