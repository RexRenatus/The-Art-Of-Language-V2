  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the trade-offs of using Google Secret Manager versus storing secrets in environment variables
    in a production app. Consider security (e.g., encryption, access control), convenience (e.g., versioning, rotation), and
    compliance (e.g., audit logs for GDPR/SOC2). Divide into groups: one defends Secret Manager, the other env vars, and switch
    sides midway.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    RSA not AES-256''), 2) Partial truth (e.g., ''Same-region only for HA''), 3) Confusable term (e.g., ''Cloud KMS instead
    of Secret Manager''). Ensure distractors are realistic from research/context.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education on Google Secret Manager (Topic Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 006_Key Management > 007_Secrets Management > Secrets Vaults and Stores > Google Secret
  Manager). Use the provided learning objectives (Bloom''s spanning REMEMBER to CREATE), active learning activities, 4-layer
  scaffolding, voter priorities (complete replication: same-region cost-effective/single-region vs. multi-region HA/auto-sync;
  pedagogy enhancements), and research context (Secrets/Versions/Collections; AES-256/CMEK encryption; IAM access; versioning/audit/replication)
  to generate 50 high-quality flashcards.


  Prioritize completeness: Include replication details, concept map elements, prior knowledge (crypto/IAM basics), big picture
  (zero-trust/secret sprawl). Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, distractors from misconceptions.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each matching this exact schema: {"front": "Question (vary: 40% MCQ, 30% Cloze,
  30% Short Answer)", "back": "Answer", "type": "MCQ/Cloze/ShortAnswer", "bloom_level": "REMEMBER/etc.", "explanation": "Rationale
  + distractor errors + tip", "distractors": [array of 3 for MCQ, else []], "scaffolding_layer": "1/2/3/4", "source": "Research/Voter/etc."}.


  Distribute: 10 per Bloom''s level approx., 12-13 per scaffolding layer. MCQs: 4 options (1 correct). Cloze: [blank] format.
  Tie to active learning (e.g., Q on trade-offs). No duplicates; cover all voter suggestions.'
