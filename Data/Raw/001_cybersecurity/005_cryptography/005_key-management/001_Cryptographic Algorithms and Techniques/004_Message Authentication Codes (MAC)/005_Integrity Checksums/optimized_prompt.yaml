active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the risks of using deprecated hash algorithms like MD5 in legacy systems versus migrating to SHA-3.
    What trade-offs exist in terms of performance, security, and compatibility? Support arguments with NIST standards (e.g.,
    FIPS 180-4, SP 800-131A) and real-world examples like software supply chain attacks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Common errors: Confuse integrity/confidentiality; MD5 as ''secure''; CRC as crypto hash; SHA-1 vs SHA-2; unkeyed hash
    for authentication.

    - Vary difficulty: 1 easy (obvious wrong), 1 medium (partial truth), 1 hard (subtle, e.g., outdated NIST rec).

    Ensure no overlap with correct answer.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Integrity Checksums (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 006_Key Management > 001_Cryptographic Algorithms and Techniques > Message
  Authentication Codes (MAC) > Integrity Checksums). Note: Unkeyed checksums detect integrity; connect to keyed MACs (e.g.,
  HMAC) for authenticity.


  Research Context: Integrity checksums (crypto hash functions like SHA-2/SHA-3) generate fixed-size digests for data integrity
  (CIA triad). NIST FIPS 180-4 (SHA-2: 224/256/384/512), FIPS 202 (SHA-3). Properties: one-way, avalanche effect, collision
  resistance. Distinguish from CRC. Avoid MD5/SHA-1 (deprecated). Sources: nist.gov (FIPS 180-4: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf;
  FIPS 202: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.202.pdf).


  Voter Consensus (100%): Emphasize pedagogy (Bloom''s), active learning, scaffolding, accuracy (checksum vs. hash distinction,
  hierarchy link via HMAC).
