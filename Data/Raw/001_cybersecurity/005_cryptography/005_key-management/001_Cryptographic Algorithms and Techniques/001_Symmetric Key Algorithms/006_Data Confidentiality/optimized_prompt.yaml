  discussion_prompt: Using the CIA triad, debate whether data confidentiality can be achieved without symmetric encryption
    in a multi-user environment—what are the key management challenges (e.g., key distribution, revocation) and how do they
    impact prior knowledge of AES modes of operation?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one learner explains NIST SP 1800-28 guidelines on asset identification, protection controls, and
    key management for symmetric encryption; the partner acts as a skeptical executive questioning feasibility—switch roles
    and provide teach-back feedback.
  problem_solving: 'Design a key management system for a hospital using symmetric keys (e.g., AES-256) to protect patient
    data confidentiality. Address NIST SP 1800-28 breach scenarios: identify assets, implement protection/detection/recovery,
    and simulate a breach response.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in optimized active recall
  flashcards using university pedagogy (Bloom''s Taxonomy, scaffolding), voter consensus, and web-grounded research on ''Data
  Confidentiality'' (Category: Cybersecurity, Domain: 001_Cryptography, Subdomain: 006_Key Management, Entry Domain: 001_Cryptographic
  Algorithms and Techniques, Entry Subdomain: Symmetric Key Algorithms).


  **Content Foundation (Completed Research Context):** Data confidentiality ensures sensitive data is protected from unauthorized
  access (CIA triad pillar). Symmetric encryption (e.g., AES block ciphers in CBC/GCM modes) provides this by transforming
  plaintext to ciphertext; key management (gen, dist, store, rotate, revoke per NIST SP 800-57) is critical. NIST SP 1800-28:
  Data Confidentiality practice guide (asset ID, protection controls like encryption, detection/response/recovery); SP 1800-29:
  Mobile Device Security (extends to key mgmt). Breaches: unauthorized disclosure. Sources: NIST.gov (SP 1800-28B/C, SP 800-53
  Rev5 A.8 Confidentiality), OWASP Data Confidentiality.


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s):** [Insert full list from above].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full scaffolding from above].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Flashcards prompt reflection on activities (e.g., ''How does this relate to hospital key
  mgmt problem-solving?'').


  **Concept Map:** Text-based: Data Confidentiality (center) → CIA:Confidentiality; → Symmetric Keys:AES→Key Mgmt (dist/rotate);
  → NIST 1800-28 (assets/protect); → Breaches (threats).


  **Generation Instructions:** Create 50 diverse flashcards (10-15 per Bloom''s level, balanced across scaffolding layers).
  Prioritize prior knowledge link (Symmetric Algorithms → Confidentiality via AES). Use exact hierarchy tags. Output ONLY
  a JSON array of flashcards, each strictly following the schema: [Insert full flashcard_schema structure]. Ensure high-quality:
  active recall questions (not definitions), plausible distractors, explanations tying to objectives/layers/NIST/symmetric
  crypto. No extra text.'
