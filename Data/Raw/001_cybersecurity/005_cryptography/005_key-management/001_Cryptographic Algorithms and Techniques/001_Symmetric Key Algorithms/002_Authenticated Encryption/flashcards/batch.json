        "core_logic": "The security of AEAD algorithms like GCM heavily relies on the uniqueness of the nonce for each encryption operation under the same key. Reusing a nonce can lead to catastrophic security failures, including key compromise. Therefore, proper nonce management is paramount.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The first distractor suggests a trade-off that compromises security. The second distractor proposes an incorrect handling of the nonce, which is typically transmitted in plaintext. The third distractor misunderstands the scope of nonce uniqueness; it must be unique per key, not just across different keys.",
        "analogy": "Think of a nonce as a unique serial number for each transaction. If you reuse the same serial number for multiple transactions, it becomes impossible to track them individually, and fraudulent activities could be masked. Each transaction needs its own distinct serial number."
