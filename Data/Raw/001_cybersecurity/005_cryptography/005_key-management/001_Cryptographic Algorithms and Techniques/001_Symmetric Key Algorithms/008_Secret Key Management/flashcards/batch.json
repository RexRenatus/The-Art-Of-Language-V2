This prevents attackers from using precomputed 'rainbow tables' to quickly crack common passwords, because the salt makes each hash unique.",

Even if two papers have the same writing (password), the stickers (salts) make them distinct, so you can't easily find all papers with the same writing using a pre-made index."

        "distractor_analysis": "Sharing a single symmetric key insecurely via email is highly risky. Storing a symmetric key on a public server makes it easily accessible. One-time pads are impractical for key management in a multi-party scenario due to the need for pre-shared, unique keys for every communication.",

Box for each partner (public key for sending) and only you have the key to open your box (private key for receiving).
