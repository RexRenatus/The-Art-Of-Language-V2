active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In light of real-world incidents like the 2014 Yahoo SSH key breach (where stolen keys granted attackers
    persistent access) and GitHub compromises (e.g., 2018 bitcoin miner attacks via leaked keys), debate the trade-offs of
    SSH keys versus passwords for secure remote access. How does poor key management contribute to supply-chain attacks like
    SolarWinds?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
