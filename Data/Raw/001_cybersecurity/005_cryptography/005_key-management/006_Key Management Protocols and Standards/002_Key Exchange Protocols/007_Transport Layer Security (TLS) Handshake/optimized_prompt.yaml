  discussion_prompt: 'Compare the TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 handshakes: Debate which vulnerabilities (e.g., renegotiation attacks,
    downgrade attacks) were fixed in 1.3, and evaluate the performance costs (e.g., reduced round trips) in terms of latency
    and security trade-offs.'
  peer_teaching: 'Pair students: One student describes the ClientHello to Server Finished flow in TLS 1.3 (including key purposes
    like cipher negotiation and extensions), while the partner quizzes them on message contents and error conditions; roles
    reverse after 5 minutes.'
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A client receives a ''cipher mismatch'' error during handshake. Provide a flowchart; students
    troubleshoot by identifying steps (e.g., check ClientHello ciphers vs. ServerHello selection), prior knowledge gaps (e.g.,
    TCP/IP compatibility), and propose fixes like updating cipher suites.'

    2) Outdated info (TLS 1.2 elements like ServerHelloDone), 3) Similar term mix-up (e.g., ClientKeyExchange vs. integrated
    DHE).'
  - Avoid random distractors; base on voter priorities (e.g., cipher mismatch) and research (e.g., session keys vs. certs).
  - Ensure one distractor is a 'near-miss' (e.g., correct for TLS 1.2 but wrong for 1.3).
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Transport Layer Security
  (TLS) Handshake (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 006_Key Management > 006_006_Key Management Protocols
  and Standards > 001_Key Exchange Protocols > Transport Layer Security (TLS) Handshake). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s
  Taxonomy (REMEMBER to CREATE), active learning, and 4-layer scaffolding.


  **Prior Knowledge:** Symmetric/asymmetric crypto, TCP/IP, PKI.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the exact array from ''learning_objectives'' above].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Weave in elements like discussion comparisons (TLS 1.2 vs 1.3), peer quizzes on flows,
  problem-solving cipher errors.


  **Scaffolding:** Strictly layer content: [Insert full scaffolding array above]. Detail TLS 1.3 steps accurately (ClientHello
  → ServerHello → EncryptedExtensions → Cert* → CertVerify* → Finished).


  **Research Context:** TLS secures channels via handshake for auth/key exchange/session keys; HTTPS uses it; fixes prior
  SSL/TLS vulns (per web sources).


  **Output Format:** JSON array of 75 flashcards. Each: {"id":1, "layer":1-4, "blooms_level":"REMEMBER", "type":"MCQ|Recall|Apply",
  "front":"Question text", "back":{"answer":"...","explanation":"... (link objective/layer)","hints":"...","source":"Hierarchy/Web"}}.
  Follow flashcard_schema exactly: MCQs have 4 options (1 correct, 3 distractors per protocol). Balance: 20% per layer, full
  Bloom''s coverage. Voter consensus: 70% approval, emphasize steps/completeness/higher-order thinking.'
