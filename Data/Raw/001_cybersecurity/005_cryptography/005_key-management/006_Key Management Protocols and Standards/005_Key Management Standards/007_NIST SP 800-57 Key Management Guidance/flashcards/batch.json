      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Risk-based key rotation is essential because it limits the amount of data that can be decrypted if a key is compromised over time. This functions by establishing a policy that balances security needs with operational feasibility, ensuring keys are refreshed before potential weaknesses are exploited.",
        "distractor_analysis": "A fixed annual schedule may be too frequent or infrequent depending on context. Waiting for suspected compromise is reactive and insecure. Rotation is a critical security practice, not a matter of preference.",
        "analogy": "Rotating keys is like changing the oil in your car. You don't wait until the engine seizes (compromise detected); you follow a schedule based on mileage (usage) and engine type (data sensitivity) to prevent catastrophic failure."
