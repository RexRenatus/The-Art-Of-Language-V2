        "distractor_analysis": "The first distractor is incorrect; block size does not dictate whether an algorithm is symmetric or asymmetric. The second is wrong as DES was used for various purposes, and wide-block is primarily for storage. The third is incorrect; both DES and wide-block encryption typically use a single key per encryption instance.",
