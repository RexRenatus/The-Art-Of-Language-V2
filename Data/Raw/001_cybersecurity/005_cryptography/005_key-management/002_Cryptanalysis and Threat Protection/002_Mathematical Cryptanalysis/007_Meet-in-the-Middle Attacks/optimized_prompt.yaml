active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare the security of Double DES versus Triple DES (3-key variant) against MITM attacks. Why does naive
    multi-encryption fail, and what real-world policy changes resulted (e.g., NIST standards deprecating 2-key 3DES)? Debate
    if any multi-key scheme is truly secure today in light of modern threats like quantum computing.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    vs. independent); 2) Brute-force equivalent (e.g., 2^112 instead of 2^56); 3) Off-by-one error (e.g., single DES complexity);
    Ensure distractors test subtle understanding (e.g., space vs. time).'

  content on this optimized structure:


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list above]


  **Active Learning:** [Insert full active_learning object]


  **Scaffolding:** [Insert full scaffolding object, including Prior Knowledge]


  **Research Context:** MITM is a known-plaintext attack using space-time tradeoff on multi-encryption (e.g., Double DES).
  Steps: 1. Forward: Encrypt P with K1 halves, store. 2. Backward: Decrypt C with K2 halves. 3. Match intermediates for keys.
  Double DES: Brute 2^112 vs MITM 2^56 time/space. Applications: Hash preimage, 3DES security (3 keys mitigate). Big picture:
  Influences NIST standards, AES adoption, key management (avoid double enc.). Comparisons: Vs. brute-force, differential
  analysis.


  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly follow [insert full flashcard_schema]. Mix types: 20 Basic Q&A, 20 MCQ, 10 Application. Distribute
  across Bloom''s levels and scaffolding layers (10% Layer1, 20% Layer2, 30% Layer3, 40% Layer4). Tag each: #BloomLevel #LayerX
  #ObjectiveY.


  Output as JSON array of objects: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''tags'': [''REMEMBER'', ''Layer1'']},
  ...]. Ensure quantitative examples (e.g., 2^56), toy problems, and misconceptions addressed. No fluff; precise, educational.'
