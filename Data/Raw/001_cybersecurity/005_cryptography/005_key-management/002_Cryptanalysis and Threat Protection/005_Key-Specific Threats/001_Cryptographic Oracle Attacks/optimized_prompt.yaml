  discussion_prompt: 'In groups, debate: ''Are compression oracle attacks (e.g., BREACH) more preventable than padding oracle
    attacks in modern TLS? Provide evidence from real-world mitigations like HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) and TLS
    1.3 changes.'' This encourages compare/contrast and critical thinking.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Cryptography (Domain: 001_Cryptography,
  Subdomain: 006_Key Management; Entry: 010_Cryptanalysis and Threat Protection, Key-Specific Threats). Topic: Cryptographic
  Oracle Attacks (Level 6 in hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 006_Key Management > 010_Cryptanalysis... > Key-Specific
  Threats > Cryptographic Oracle Attacks).


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards (10 Basic Q&A, 10 MCQ, 10 Cloze) optimized for spaced repetition and Bloom''s Taxonomy.
  Cover all learning objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]. Incorporate prerequisites (AES, CBC, PKCS#7) and
  distinguish crypto oracles from blockchain oracles (e.g., stock/weather data feeds).


  Structure content via 4 scaffolding layers: [INSERT scaffolding JSON HERE]. Include active learning hooks in explanations:
