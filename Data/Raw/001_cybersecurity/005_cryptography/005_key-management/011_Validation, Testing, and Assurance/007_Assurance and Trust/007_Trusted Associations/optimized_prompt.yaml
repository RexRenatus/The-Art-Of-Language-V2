active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the risks of weak trusted associations in a public-key infrastructure (PKI)
    system (e.g., certificate chain compromise). Propose mitigations using NIST SP 800-57 key lifecycle stages and justify
    with real-world examples like the SolarWinds breach.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Topic Definition**: Trusted Associations are cryptographic mechanisms establishing verifiable trust between entities via
  keys, signatures, hashes, trust anchors, and certificate chains, per NIST SP 800-57 (Key Management) and SP 800-63-4 (Digital
  Identity).


  **Topic Hierarchy**: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 006_Key Management > 011_Validation, Testing, and Assurance > Assurance
  and Trust > Trusted Associations.


  **Expanded Research Context** (complete from NIST):

  - Cryptography: Secure comms via math (nist.gov).

  - Components: Block ciphers (AES), Hashes (SHA-3), Signatures (ECDSA), Key Mgmt (SP 800-57: lifecycle phases).

  - Standards: SP 800-57 Pt1r5 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r5.pdf) - Key lifecycle;
  SP 800-63-4 (https://pages.nist.gov/800-63/) - Authenticators/assurance; NIST CSF (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework);
  FIPS 140-3 (modules).

  - Trust: PKI chains, revocation (CRLs/OCSP).

  **Scaffolding Layers** (distribute cards): [insert full scaffolding from above].


  **Active Learning Ties** (include on each card back): [insert summaries from above].


  **Flashcard Generation**:

  - Generate 80 high-quality flashcards per schema.

  - Schema: [insert full flashcard_schema from above].

  - Ensure progression: Start with foundation, build to integration.

  - Connect to prior: Reference basic crypto/PKI.

  - Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''references'':
  ''...'', ''active_learning_tie'': ''...'', ''blooms_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''...''}}].


  Prioritize completeness, clarity, measurable verbs. No fabrication—ground in NIST.'
