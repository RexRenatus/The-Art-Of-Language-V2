active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the implications of a failed certificate signature verification during
    a TLS handshake. What real-world attacks (e.g., rogue CA scenarios) could exploit this, and how do standards like RFC
    5280 mitigate them? Reference voter-noted misconceptions like confusing signature verification with encryption.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Verification uses recipient's private key' instead
      of issuer's public; 'Signatures encrypt the TBS' vs. hash+sign; outdated algs like MD5).
    - 'Draw from voter notes: Confuse sig verification with encryption; assume all CAs trusted equally.'
    - 'Vary: 1 factual inversion, 1 overgeneralization, 1 unrelated standard (e.g., mix FIPS 186 with TLS 1.3).'
    - 'Ensure distractors teach: Explanation debunks them explicitly.'
