active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the risks of storing encryption keys in mobile app databases or SharedPreferences versus hardware-backed
    keystores. Reference real-world breaches like Uber 2016 and debate whether convenience APIs should ever be used for keys,
    considering trade-offs in usability and security.
  peer_teaching: 'Jigsaw activity: Divide learners into expert groups on NIST SP 800-57 parts (Part 1: General, Part 2: Organizational,
    Part 3: Application-Specific). Each group teaches peers how to apply concepts to mobile key storage (e.g., key derivation
    for biometrics), followed by teach-back Q&A.'
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: Your team is developing a VPN app for mobile devices. Design key storage handling device theft,
    rooting/jailbreaking, and key rotation. Create a threat model (using draw.io or similar), prototype mitigations with Android
    Keystore/StrongBox or iOS Secure Enclave, and present solutions.'

    APIs, wrong NIST parts); 4) Real-world errors (e.g., Uber breach pitfalls like plaintext in databases). Ensure distractors
    teach by correction in explanation. Balance coverage: 40% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate/Create.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom''s Taxonomy, active
  learning, and scaffolded pedagogy. Topic: Mobile Device Key Storage (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 006_Key
  Management > Application-Specific 006_Key Management > Mobile and IoT 006_Key Management > Mobile Device Key Storage). Consensus-approved
