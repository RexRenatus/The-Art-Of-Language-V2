active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare Android KeyStore with iOS Secure Enclave in terms of key protection mechanisms (e.g., TEE/SE
    vs. Secure Enclave), hardware binding, and extraction resistance. Discuss scenarios where one platform might be preferable
    for an IoT banking app, considering factors like device fragmentation and performance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    via KeyStore.exportKey()'' - false, non-exportable); 2) Partial truths (e.g., ''Always uses TEE'' - optional hardware-backed);
    3) Unrelated/confusable terms (e.g., SharedPreferences vs. KeyStore); 4) Edge cases (e.g., software vs. hardware keys).
    Ensure plausible for mid-level learners.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Android KeyStore (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 006_Key Management > Application-Specific 006_Key Management > Mobile and
  IoT 006_Key Management > Android KeyStore). Use the provided research context: Android KeyStore protects non-exportable
  cryptographic keys via isolation (keys never enter app process), hardware-backed TEE/SE, extraction prevention. Complete
  Key Attestation: Generate attested keys, verify via Google-rooted cert chains.


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL DETAILS ABOVE] - Tie cards to these (e.g., ''Relates to discussion on iOS comparison'')

  - Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL LAYERS ABOVE] - Distribute cards across layers

  - Prior knowledge: Symmetric/asymmetric keys from 001_Cryptography.

  - Best practices: User auth, non-exportable, attestation.

  - Misconceptions: Keys exportable, always TEE.


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards in JSON array format. Balance types: 30% basic, 30% cloze, 40% MCQ. Follow exact schema:

  [{"type": "basic|cloze|mcq", "front": "...", "back": "...", "blooms_level": "REMEMBER", "scaffolding_layer": "1", "explanation":
  "Detailed rationale + misconception debunk + active learning link", "tags": ["android-keystore", "key-attestation"] }]


  Ensure active recall, spaced repetition optimization (concise fronts, explanatory backs), university pedagogy (progressive
  Bloom''s), and web-grounded accuracy. Output ONLY the JSON array.'
