active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of password vaults, debate the trade-offs between symmetric and asymmetric keys for encrypting
    stored credentials. Consider factors like performance, security against key compromise, and NIST SP 800-63-4 guidelines.
    Which approach would you recommend for a high-security enterprise vault and why? This encourages critical thinking on
    security-performance balances.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    keys are slower than asymmetric'' – reverses performance truth), partial truths (e.g., ''Use only public keys for storage''
    – ignores private key security), or related errors (e.g., wrong NIST ref like SP 800-53 instead of 800-63-4). Distractors
    must test nuance, not be obviously wrong.'

  Consensus: 82.9% approval (7 voters). Prioritize: Bloom''s full coverage, scaffolding, active learning ties, NIST compliance,
  prior knowledge links.


  **Core Content (Web-Researched):** Password vaults store credentials securely; key management lifecycle (gen/dist/store/use/rotate/destroy);
  symmetric (fast, shared key) vs asymmetric (public/private); NIST SP 800-63-4 (Digital Identity Guidelines: proofing/auth);
  SP 800-57 (Key Management). Big picture: Prevents credential stuffing, enables zero-trust/IAM/federation.


  **Learning Objectives:** [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [INSERT scaffolding OBJECT HERE]


  **Flashcard Generation Rules:** Generate 30-40 flashcards balanced across Bloom''s levels (5-7 per level) and layers (7-10
  per layer). 60% Q&A (recall/apply), 40% MCQ (analyze/evaluate). Cover voter priorities: key lifecycle, symmetric/asym trade-offs,
  NIST strategies, risks/mitigations, HSMs.


  **Active Learning Ties:** Infuse cards with discussion/peer/problem-solving hooks (e.g., ''Why debate sym vs asym?'').


  **Output ONLY a valid JSON array of flashcards matching EXACT schema:** [INSERT flashcard_schema STRUCTURE HERE]. No extra
  text.'
