  \ optimized for Anki/Quizlet using university pedagogy: Bloom's Taxonomy (mix remember/understand 30%, apply/analyze 40%,\
  \ evaluate/create 30%), active recall, spaced repetition.\n\nIncorporate:\n- Learning objectives: [INSERT LEARNING OBJECTIVES\
  \ ARRAY HERE]\n- Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers – Layer 1 Foundation (basics, prior knowledge: AES/symmetric\
  \ crypto), Layer 2 Components (KW/KWP/TKW, NIST SP 800-38F), Layer 3 Implementation (steps, pseudocode), Layer 4 Integration\
  \ (EPC/NIST compliance, financial apps).\n- Active learning ties: Reference discussion (AES-KW vs KWP trade-offs), peer\
  \ teaching (steps), problem-solving (designs/mitigations).\n- Research context: Key wrapping for confidentiality/integrity;\
  \ standards NIST SP 800-38F (AES-KW/KWP), SP 800-227, EPC342-08; big picture key lifecycle.\n\nOutput strictly in JSON array\
