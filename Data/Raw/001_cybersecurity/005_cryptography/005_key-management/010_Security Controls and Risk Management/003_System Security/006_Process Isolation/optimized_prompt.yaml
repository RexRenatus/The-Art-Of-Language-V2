active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: Pair students to explain SC-39 enhancements (e.g., Linux seccomp + namespaces) to each other; switch roles
    and administer teach-back quizzes with peer feedback on accuracy and clarity.
  problem_solving: In teams, design a key management system incorporating process isolation to prevent privilege escalation
    during a simulated breach scenario (e.g., attacker exploits IPC); prototype with pseudocode and evaluate against NIST
    controls.

    2. Related but incorrect concept (e.g., confuse with thread isolation or virtualization).

    3. Edge case or partial truth (e.g., ''Effective only in hardware'' when software suffices).

    Ensure distractors challenge advanced learners, drawing from OS differences, standards, or integration pitfalls.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for university-level cybersecurity education, specializing in Process\
  \ Isolation (NIST SC-39). Use Bloom's Taxonomy, active learning, and 4-layer scaffolding for progressive mastery. Corrected\

  \ 3: System and Communications Protection / System Security\n- Level 4: Process Isolation (SC-39)\n\nCore content summary:\n\
  - Concepts: Execution domain, separate address space, IPC (pipes, sockets, shared memory—must be controlled), elevation\
  \ of privilege mitigation.\n- Standards: NIST SP 800-53r5 SC-39 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf),\
