active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one learner teaches the other core concepts such as change detection, system monitoring, and scanning
    methods (signature-based, heuristic, behavioral). The listener summarizes and asks clarifying questions, then switches
    roles. Use think-pair-share to address prerequisites like the CIA triad and basic malware types (virus, worm, trojan).
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: An organization experiences a ransomware infection despite anti-virus deployment. Design a multi-step
    response plan using anti-virus/anti-spyware tools, including scanning, quarantine, removal, and post-incident review.
    Incorporate selection criteria, configuration best practices from NIST SP 800-83, and integration with risk management.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education on ''Anti-Virus/Anti-Spyware'' (corrected
  hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Controls > System Security > Anti-Virus/Anti-Spyware; not under Cryptography/Key Management).
  Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives [insert learning_objectives array], active learning activities [insert
  active_learning object], and 4 scaffolding layers [insert scaffolding_layers object]. Prerequisites: CIA triad, malware
  types, OS basics, risk management.


  Incorporate NIST research: Malware def, AV techniques (signature/heuristic/behavioral scanning, change detection, system
  monitor), SP 800-83 best practices.


  Generate flashcards per schema [insert flashcard_schema]: Varied Q/A formats, distractors from misconceptions, explanations
  with refs/tags. Output JSON array of 75 flashcards, each {''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''tags'': [...]}}. Ensure accuracy, progression from Layer 1 foundation to Layer 4 integration, and engagement
  for active learning.'
