        "core_logic": "NAT is a technique used by firewalls to conserve public IP addresses and provide a layer of obscurity by translating private, internal IP addresses into a single public IP address for external communication. This process facilitates internet access for multiple devices using a limited number of public IPs.",

        "analogy": "NAT is like a receptionist at a large company. All employees (internal devices) use internal phone extensions (private IPs). When they make an external call, the receptionist (firewall with NAT) uses the company's main phone number (public IP) so the outside world only sees that number."
