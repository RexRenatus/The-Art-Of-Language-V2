  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the statement: ''VPNs are sufficient for enterprise security in remote work environments, or
    do they introduce new risks like key compromise and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on public Wi-Fi?'' Encourage critical
    thinking on trade-offs, misconceptions (e.g., VPNs provide perfect anonymity), and links to GDPR/privacy regulations.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    perfectly'' -> distractor: ''Always hides IP from all parties''), (2) Related but incorrect concept (e.g., for Diffie-Hellman:
    ''RSA encryption'' instead of key exchange), (3) Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''PSK is most secure'' ignoring
    PFS). Ensure distractors test nuance in key management.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Virtual Private Networks
  (VPN) within Domain 001_Cryptography > Subdomain 006_Key Management, integrating Entry Domains Security Controls, 002_Risk

  Generate 50 high-quality, spaced-repetition-optimized flashcards covering the full topic. Base content on: Web research
  (VPN tunnels encrypt via IPsec/SSL with IP masking, key benefits like public Wi-Fi security, remote access); Voter consensus
  (emphasize IKE, Diffie-Hellman, PFS, key rotation/revocation, protocols comparison); Prerequisites (encryption basics, networking).


  Incorporate pedagogy:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to discussion (VPN risks), peer teaching (VPN types/key lifecycle), problem-solving (key
  failure troubleshooting).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute evenly across 4 layers [insert full scaffolding above].


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly [insert full schema above]. Mix types: 20% definition/remember, 20% cloze/understand, 30%
  MCQ/apply-analyze, 15% comparison/analyze, 15% process/create. Ensure 68.6% voter-approved focus on key mgmt (e.g., IKE
  phases, PFS vs. non-PFS risks). Big picture: VPNs enable secure remote work via crypto integration.


  Output ONLY a valid JSON array of flashcards, no additional text.'
