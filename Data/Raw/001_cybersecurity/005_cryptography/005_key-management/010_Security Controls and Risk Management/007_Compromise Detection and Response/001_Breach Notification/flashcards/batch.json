Its purpose is to introduce randomness, ensuring that even if the same plaintext block appears multiple times, it will be encrypted differently each time, thus preventing pattern analysis and enhancing confidentiality.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The IV is not the secret key; it's typically sent in the clear alongside the ciphertext. It does not perform compression. It is also distinct from digital signatures, which provide authenticity and integrity.",
        "analogy": "An IV is like a unique starting point for a race. Even if two runners start on the same track (same key and plaintext), the unique starting point ensures their paths and progress are different, making it harder to predict or compare their overall race."

This allows authorized entities (e.g., law enforcement with a warrant) to access the keys under specific legal or policy conditions, enabling decryption of otherwise protected data. It balances privacy with the need for lawful access.",

This dual focus is critical because simply restoring systems without addressing data security risks leaves the organization vulnerable.",
