        "core_logic": "The primary goal of cryptographic key management is to protect keys throughout their lifecycle (generation, storage, use, destruction) to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the cryptographic system and the data it protects. This functions by implementing robust policies and procedures for handling keys securely.",

        "analogy": "Key management is like managing a library's rare book collection. You need to ensure the books (keys) are kept safe (confidentiality), that they aren't altered (integrity), and that authorized people can access them when needed (availability), throughout their entire existence."
