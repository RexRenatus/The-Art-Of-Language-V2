        "core_logic": "NIST SP 800-130 provides a framework for designing Cryptographic Key Management Systems (CKMS) by outlining topics and documentation requirements for designers, because effective key management is critical for overall cryptographic security. This functions by providing a structured approach to CKMS development.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors are other relevant NIST publications, but SP 800-53 is a broader security control catalog, SP 800-57 covers key management best practices and policies, and SP 800-90A deals with random number generation, not CKMS design frameworks.",
        "analogy": "If you want to build a secure vault (CKMS), SP 800-130 is like the architectural blueprint detailing how to design it, while SP 800-57 is like the manual on how to operate and manage the vault's contents (keys)."
