active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Why did DES designers choose exactly 16 rounds? In small groups, debate the trade-offs between security
    (e.g., resistance to differential cryptanalysis), performance on 1970s hardware, and why it was later deemed insufficient
    despite meeting initial Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA) requirements.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Plausible but incorrect: e.g., Common misconceptions (DES has 17 rounds? No, 16 + final swap), outdated facts (48-bit
      key? No, 56 effective), or confusions (AES rounds: 10/12/14).'
    - 'Variety: 1 numerical (wrong count like 15/32), 1 conceptual (e.g., ''RSA rounds'' instead of DES), 1 advanced (e.g.,
      post-DES like 3DES triple rounds).'
    - 'Avoid randomness: Ground in real DES errors (e.g., S-boxes=6 not 8) or voter-noted irrelevancies (PQC rounds).'
    - 'Balance: Ensure 70% target lower Bloom''s (1-2), 30% higher (3-4).'

  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 003_Symmetric Cryptography > 002_Block Cipher Algorithms > Data Encryption
  Standard (DES) > 16 Rounds). Prerequisites: Block Ciphers, Feistel Networks.


  Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema: Multiple Choice (1 correct, 3 distractors), Front (question
  + options), Back (bold correct + explanation + Bloom level + layer).

  - Scaffolding Layers: [PASTE FULL LIST HERE] (10 cards/layer).

  - Distractor Protocol: [PASTE FULL PROTOCOL HERE].

  - Active Learning Ties: Weave in discussion/peer/problem-solving hints in 20% explanations.


  Focus EXCLUSIVELY on DES''s 16 Feistel rounds: structure (E-box, S-boxes, P-box, subkeys), purpose (diffusion/confusion),
  security (why 16, differential cryptanalysis). NO PQC, NIST SP 800-63, or unrelated topics.

  ''A) ...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''REMEMBER'', ''layer'': 1}}, ...]. Ensure university pedagogy: active
  recall, spaced repetition friendly, measurable progress through Bloom''s.'
