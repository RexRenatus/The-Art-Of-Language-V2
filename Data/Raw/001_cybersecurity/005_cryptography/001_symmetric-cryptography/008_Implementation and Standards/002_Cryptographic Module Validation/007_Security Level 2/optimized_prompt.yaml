active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of implementing FIPS 140 Security Level 2 versus higher
    levels for symmetric cryptography modules in commercial products. Consider cost, security benefits, and real-world threats
    like physical tampering. Support arguments with NIST references.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs: Generate 3 distractors that are plausible based on common errors—1 from SL1 (e.g., ''no
    authentication''), 1 from SL3 (e.g., ''tamper-resistant''), 1 general misconception (e.g., ''biometrics required''). Ensure
    distractors teach by contrast.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in FIPS 140-2/3 Cryptographic
  Module Validation at Security Level 2 (SL2). Topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 003_Symmetric Cryptography
  > 008_Implementation and Standards > Cryptographic Module Validation > Security Level 2. IGNORE CMMC 2.0; focus exclusively
  on FIPS 140 SL2 requirements: role-based authentication (Crypto Officer/User), tamper-evident physical security, key zeroization,
  authenticated self-tests (power-on, conditional), per NIST/CMVP/CAVP.


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning objectives: [insert array above].

  - Active learning: Use for scenario cards (e.g., discussion-style Qs).

  - Scaffolding: Tag each card with layer 1-4.


  Follow flashcard schema exactly:

  - Output JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''hints'':
  [...], ''source'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''Remember'', ''layer'': 1, ''type'': ''MCQ/cloze/etc.''}, ''distractors'':
  [''opt1'', ''opt2'', ''opt3''] for MCQs}].

  - 25 cards: Balanced Bloom''s, accurate to FIPS 140-3 (e.g., IG 9.7 for testing). Sources: NIST FIPS 140-3, SP 800-140 series.

  - Distractors: Plausible FIPS misconceptions (SL1/SL3 mix-ups).

  Generate high-quality, exam-ready flashcards promoting active recall.'
