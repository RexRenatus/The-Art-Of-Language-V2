active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the risks of cryptographic non-compliance using real-world case studies
    like the Equifax breach (weak key management) or Heartbleed (poor implementation of approved standards). How does NIST
    SP 800-175B prevent such failures, and what mechanisms (e.g., AES for confidentiality, HMAC for integrity) would you recommend
    retrofitting?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST standards. Generate
  25 high-quality flashcards on ''NIST SP 800-175B (Cryptographic Standards Guideline)'' in Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography
  > 003_Symmetric Cryptography > 008_Implementation and Standards > Cryptographic Standards > NIST SP 800-175B. Ensure completeness:
  Cover symmetric (AES), asymmetric (RSA 2048+, ECC P-256+), hash (SHA-256+), MAC (HMAC-SHA2), digital signatures (ECDSA,
  RSA-PSS), key management; services (confidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation).


  Incorporate pedagogy: Align to Bloom''s objectives [insert learning_objectives array]. Use active learning hooks in explanations
  [insert active_learning summaries]. Scaffold content across 4 layers [insert scaffolding details]. Include textual concept
  map in relevant cards.


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards, each: {''front'': ''Question or MCQ'', ''type'': ''mcq/open'', ''back'': {''answer'':
  ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'', ''opt3'']
  if MCQ}}.


  Follow flashcard_schema strictly: Varied types, distractors per protocol, explanations with citations/case studies (Heartbleed,
  Equifax). Balance coverage: 25% Layer1, 30% Layer2, 25% Layer3, 20% Layer4. Promote retention via active recall, spaced
  repetition best practices.'
