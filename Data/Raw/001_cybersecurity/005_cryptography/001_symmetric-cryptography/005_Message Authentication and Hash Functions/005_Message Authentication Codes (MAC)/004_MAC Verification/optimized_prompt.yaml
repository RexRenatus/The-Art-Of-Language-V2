  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning objectives: [insert full list from above]

  - Active learning: Use discussion/peer/problem-solving to inspire applied cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [insert summaries].

  - Research: NIST-approved MACs (HMAC-FIPS198, CMAC-SP800-38B, GMAC-SP800-38D, KMAC-FIPS202). MAC verifies integrity/authenticity
  via recompute F(K,M)==received_MAC. Sources: NIST SP800-63B-4, FIPS198-1.

  - Prior links: Symmetric keys, hashes.

  - Concept map: MAC Verification → Generation/Integrity/Authenticity/HMAC-CMAC/Deps(Key/Hash]/Links[Signatures/AEAD].


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following the exact schema:
