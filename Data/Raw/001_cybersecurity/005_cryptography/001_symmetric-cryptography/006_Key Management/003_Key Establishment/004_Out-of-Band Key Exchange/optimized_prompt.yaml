active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios would you recommend out-of-band key exchange over in-band methods like Diffie-Hellman?
    Debate the trade-offs in security, usability, and implementation complexity, using examples from NIST SP 800-56A/B or
    apps like Signal.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Advantages/disadvantages swaps (e.g., ''improves usability'' as distractor for disadvantage); 3) Confusions (in-band
    vs OOB, agreement vs transport); 4) Partial truths (e.g., NIST SP 800-56A only for asymmetric). Ensure distractors test
    deeper understanding.'
