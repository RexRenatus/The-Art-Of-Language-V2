  Generate 20 high-quality flashcards on ''Multi-Person Authorization'' that optimize learning via university pedagogy.


  **Context & Big Picture:** Multi-person authorization (four-eyes principle, separation of duties) mitigates insider threats
  in symmetric key distribution challenges, enhancing cryptographic system resilience (e.g., NIST SP 800-57 Part 1, SP 800-63-4).
  Sources: NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 (Key Management), NIST SP 800-63-4 (Digital Identity Guidelines), HSM standards.


  **Topic Hierarchy:** [''Cybersecurity'', ''001_Cryptography'', ''003_Symmetric 001_Cryptography'', ''006_Key Management'',
  ''Key Distribution Challenges'', ''Multi-Person Authorization'']


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s Coverage):** [Insert the learning_objectives array here]. Distribute flashcards evenly across
  levels.


  **Scaffolding:** Build progressively: Layer 1 (Foundation), Layer 2 (Components), Layer 3 (Implementation), Layer 4 (Integration).
  Reference layers in explanations.


  **Active Learning Tie-In:** Questions should inspire discussion (e.g., SolarWinds), application (e.g., cloud key sharing),
  analysis (e.g., HSM vs. NIST).


  **Generation Rules:**

  - 40% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 30% APPLY/ANALYZE, 30% EVALUATE/CREATE.

  - Questions: Varied formats (definition, scenario, comparison, design critique).

  - Answers: Precise, 1-sentence ideal.

  - Distractors: Follow protocol - plausible crypto/key mgmt errors.

  - Explanations: 2-4 sentences, link to objectives/scaffolding/sources/active learning.

  - Incorporate examples: Threshold crypto, MPC, HSM dual-control.


  **Output:** ONLY a valid JSON array of 20 flashcards matching the EXACT schema provided. No intro/outro. Validate before
  output.'
