active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of PCI standards, debate the advantages and limitations of Point-to-Point Encryption (P2PE)
    versus traditional PIN encryption methods in reducing PCI DSS compliance scope for merchants. Consider real-world breach
    examples like the 2013 Target incident and trade-offs in implementation costs, security, and fraud prevention.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    ''HSM is software-based'' vs. hardware; ''P2PE eliminates all PCI compliance'' vs. reduces scope; outdated standards like
    PCI v1). Ensure distractors are 70% plausible from research context or voter notes.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom''s Taxonomy, active

  Cryptography > 009_Applications and Use Cases > Industry-Specific Applications.


  Core Content (from research): PIN (cardholder numeric password), PIN Encryption (symmetric crypto like 3DES/AES), P2PE (encrypts
  from POI to secure env, reduces PCI scope), HSM (tamper-proof hardware for PIN ops/key mgmt), Key Management (gen/dist/store/use/destroy),
  PCI PIN Security Requirements (secure PIN processing; refs v2.0/3.1, ANSI/EMV/ISO/FIPS/NIST), PCI P2PE/PTS/DSS. Big Picture:
  Protects payments, prevents breaches (e.g., Target 2013).


  Learning Objectives: [INSERT ARRAY FROM ABOVE].

  Scaffolding: Prior Knowledge [INSERT], Layer 1 [INSERT], Layer 2 [INSERT], Layer 3 [INSERT], Layer 4 [INSERT].

  Active Learning Integration: Weave in discussion (P2PE vs traditional), peer teaching (HSM diagrams), problem-solving (key
  mgmt design).
