  discussion_prompt: 'Debate in groups: Is symmetric encryption alone sufficient for securing mobile app data at rest versus
    in transit? Reference OWASP MASVS-CRYPTO-1 (strong crypto primitives) and MASVS-CRYPTO-2 (key management). Argue for hybrid
    symmetric-asymmetric approaches and consider mobile-specific risks like physical device access.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Mobile Application Security\
  \ within Symmetric Cryptography. Use university pedagogy: Bloom's Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding. Topic Hierarchy:\
  \ Cybersecurity > Cryptography > Symmetric Cryptography > Applications and Use Cases > Industry-Specific Applications >\
  \ Mobile Application Security. Prior Knowledge: AES basics, key exchange challenges.\n\nIncorporate:\n- Learning Objectives:\
  \ [Paste the 6 objectives above]\n- Scaffolding Layers: [Paste the 4 layers above]\n- Active Learning: Inspire flashcards\
  \ that prep for [discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving above]\n- Research: OWASP MASVS-CRYPTO-1/2 (strong crypto, key\
  \ mgmt), NIST SP 800-57, sym encryption for bulk/fast mobile data, hybrid w/ asym for keys, hashing for integrity (irreversible).\n\
  \nGenerate 25 high-quality flashcards following this exact schema per card:\n{\n  \"front\": \"Question...\",\n  \"back\"\
  : {\n    \"answer\": \"...\",\n    \"explanation\": \"...\",\n    \"bloom_level\": \"...\",\n    \"scaffolding_layer\":\

  : \"OWASP MASVS, NIST SP 800-57\"}\n}\nOutput as a JSON array of 25 cards. Ensure clarity, no malformed terms. Distractors\
  \ from misconceptions (e.g., hashing reversible, sym uses public keys). Include voter-inspired checks: MCQ on sym key use,\
  \ MASVS reqs, T/F hashing reversible, short answer on sym for mobile."
