active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how a data integrity breach (e.g., via ransomware) could cascade into violations
    of GDPR data protection principles or NIST compliance. Provide examples from recent cybersecurity incidents and propose
    symmetric crypto-based mitigations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    1. Common misconception (e.g., confuse integrity with confidentiality).

    2. Related but incorrect term (e.g., ''checksum'' vs. ''hash'').

    3. Partial truth/exaggeration (e.g., ''ensures speed'' instead of ''consistency'').

    Ensure distractors test deeper understanding; reference voter priorities and research (e.g., threats from NIST).'
