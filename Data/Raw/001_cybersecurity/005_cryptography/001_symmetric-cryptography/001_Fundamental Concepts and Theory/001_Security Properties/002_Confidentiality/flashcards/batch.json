        "core_logic": "End-to-end encryption (E2EE) provides superior confidentiality because messages are encrypted at the source and decrypted only at the destination, meaning intermediaries (including the service provider) cannot access the plaintext. TLS only encrypts traffic between client and server.",
        "distractor_analysis": "E2EE doesn't necessarily use stronger algorithms; its strength lies in key management. E2EE applies to data in transit, not at rest. E2EE keys are typically endpoint-controlled, not provider-managed.",
        "analogy": "TLS encryption is like sending a package through a courier service that uses a locked truck. E2EE is like putting the item in a locked box that only the recipient has the key to open, even the courier can't see inside."
