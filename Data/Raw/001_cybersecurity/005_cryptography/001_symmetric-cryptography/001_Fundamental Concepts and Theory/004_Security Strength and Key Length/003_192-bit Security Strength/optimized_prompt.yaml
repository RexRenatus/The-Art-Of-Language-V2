active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given NIST SP 800-57 guidelines and emerging quantum threats (e.g., Grover's algorithm reducing symmetric
    security by half), is 192-bit security strength sufficient for protecting sensitive data until 2030? Argue for or against,
    citing calculations of brute-force efforts (2^192 operations) and supercomputer benchmarks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
