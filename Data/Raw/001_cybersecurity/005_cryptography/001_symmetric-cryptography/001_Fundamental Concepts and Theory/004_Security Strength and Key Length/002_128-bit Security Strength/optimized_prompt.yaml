  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''128-bit security strength is sufficient for all applications
    today, but quantum computing will render it obsolete.'' Use NIST SP 800-57 guidelines, brute-force calculations (2^128
    operations), and Grover''s algorithm (effective halving to 2^64) to support arguments. Identify scenarios where 128-bit
    remains viable post-quantum.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in cryptography. Use the following\
  \ optimized learning framework for the topic '128-bit Security Strength' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography >\
  \ 003_Symmetric Cryptography > 001_Fundamental Concepts and Theory > Security Strength and Key Length > 128-bit Security\
  \ Strength).\n\n**Learning Objectives (Bloom's Taxonomy):** [Insert full list from above].\n\n**Scaffolding Layers:** Generate\
  \ flashcards grouped by these 4 layers: [Insert full scaffolding details].\n\n**Active Learning Integration:** Infuse cards\
  \ with hooks to activities, e.g., 'Discuss: How does this relate to quantum threats?'\n\n**Content Sources:** NIST FIPS\
  \ 197 (AES), SP 800-57 (security strengths: AES-128=128-bit, etc.; methods for providing security strength). Key facts:\
  \ 2^128 ≈ 3.4e38 ops; DES 56-bit weak; quantum Grover halves effective strength.\n\n**Flashcard Output Format (JSON array):**\
