active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In small groups, discuss why the Caesar Cipher was sufficient for Julius Caesar's time but insecure today.
    Consider modern computing power, Kerckhoffs' principle (security depends on key secrecy, not algorithm), and how it paved
    the way for polyalphabetic ciphers like Vigenère. Share one historical or modern analogy.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    mix-ups, 5) Off-by-one shifts, 6) Historical inaccuracies (e.g., Caesar used shift 1, not 3). Ensure plausible for intermediate

  Shift Cipher (Caesar Cipher).


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards (10 Basic Q/A, 10 Cloze, 5 MCQ, 5 Application) optimized for Anki/Spaced Repetition.
  Cover all Bloom''s levels and scaffolding layers:

  - Layer 1 Foundation: Definitions (plaintext, ciphertext, shift key, mod 26).

  - Layer 2 Components: Formulas, wrap-around.

  - Layer 3 Implementation: Encrypt/decrypt steps, examples.

  - Layer 4 Integration: Cryptanalysis (brute-force, frequency ''E''), weaknesses, links to Vigenère/AES.


  Incorporate active learning: Include prompts inspired by peer teaching (e.g., ''Encrypt shift 5''), problem-solving (''Brute-force
  KHOOR''), discussion (security critique).


  Use provided schema exactly:

  - Basic: Front Q | Back A + Expl + Bloom + Layer

  - Cloze: Text with {{c1::gap}}

  - MCQ: Q + A/B/C/D + Expl (distractors: mod errors, freq mix-ups)

  - Application: Scenario | Steps + Ans


  Ensure university pedagogy: Measurable objectives (e.g., ''Apply: Decrypt X''), formative checks, voter consensus (historical
  decode, multi-shift create). Ground in research: Caesar history, formulas, insecurity (25 keys). Output as markdown list:
