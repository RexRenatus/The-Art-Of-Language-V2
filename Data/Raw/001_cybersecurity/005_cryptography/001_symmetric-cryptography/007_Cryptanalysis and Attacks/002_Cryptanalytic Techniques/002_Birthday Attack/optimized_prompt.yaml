  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate why birthday attacks pose a greater practical threat to hash-based digital
    signatures than brute-force preimage attacks. Use the birthday paradox math and real-world examples like MD5 collisions
    in Flame malware to support your arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in cryptography. Generate\
  \ 40-50 high-quality Anki-style flashcards on the topic 'Birthday Attack' (Category: Cybersecurity, Domain: 001_Cryptography,\
  \ Subdomain: Hash Functions/Cryptanalysis, Entry: 007_Cryptanalysis and Attacks > Cryptanalytic Techniques > Birthday Attack).\
  \ Note: Birthday attacks target hash collision resistance, NOT symmetric cryptography—correct any misconceptions.\n\nIncorporate\
  \ these elements:\n- **Learning Objectives** (span Bloom's): [insert full list from above]\n- **Scaffolding Layers** (10\

  \ for m=2^n slots), examples (MD5 Flame malware Wang 2004, SHA-1 SHAttered 2017, ROCA), NIST (SP 800-107: SHA-256+ recommended;\
