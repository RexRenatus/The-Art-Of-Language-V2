active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the strengths and weaknesses of algebraic attacks compared to statistical
    methods like differential cryptanalysis. Provide real-world examples such as Courtois' attack on SERPENT or attacks on
    stream ciphers like Grain and Trivium. How do these inform modern cipher design in NIST standards?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse algebraic with linear algebra/brute
      force; mix up XL with AES; reference similar attacks like differential)
    - 'Distractors must be: 1) Superficially similar (e.g., ''Groebner bases'' vs. ''Gaussian elimination''), 2) From adjacent
      concepts (finite fields vs. integers), 3) Real but incorrect examples (Trivium vulnerable vs. AES resistant)'
    - Ensure one 'attractive trap' (half-right, e.g., 'Statistical analysis' for equation setup)
    count: Aim for 20-30 flashcards total, balanced across Bloom's levels and scaffolding layers
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in cryptography. Generate
  25 high-quality Anki-style flashcards on ''Algebraic Attacks'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 003_Symmetric
  Cryptography > 007_Cryptanalysis and Attacks > Cryptanalytic Techniques > Algebraic Attacks). Base content on provided research:
  algebraic representation of ciphers as polynomial systems over finite fields, solving via Groebner bases/XL, examples (SERPENT,
  HFE, Grain/Trivium), NIST context avoiding algebraic weaknesses.
