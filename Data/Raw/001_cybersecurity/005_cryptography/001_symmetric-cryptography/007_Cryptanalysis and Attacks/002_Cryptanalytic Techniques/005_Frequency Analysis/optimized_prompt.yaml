  **Topic Context (Use Exactly):** Category: Cybersecurity; Domain: 001_Cryptography; Subdomain: 003_Symmetric Cryptography;
  Entry Domain: 007_Cryptanalysis and Attacks; Entry Subdomain: Cryptanalytic Techniques; Topic: Frequency Analysis. Hierarchy:
  [''Cybersecurity'', ''001_Cryptography'', ''003_Symmetric Cryptography'', ''007_Cryptanalysis and Attacks'', ''Cryptanalytic
  Techniques'', ''Frequency Analysis'']. Big Picture: Fundamental cryptanalytic technique for classical ciphers; exploits
  language stats; fails modern due to diffusion/confusion; used in history (Zodiac, Enigma prep) and CTFs.


  **Key Content (Integrate):** Foundation: Definitions (frequency analysis, ciphertext, etc.). Components: English freq table
  (E12.7,T9.1,A8.2,O7.5,I7,N6.7,S6.3,H6.1,R6,D4.3,...Z0.1); bigrams TH,HE,ER. Implementation: Steps, samples (e.g., ''ETAOIN
  SHRDLU''). Integration: Polyalphabetic limits (Vigenère), repeats, cribs.


  **Learning Objectives:** [paste the learning_objectives array here].

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [paste scaffolding_layers here].

  **Active Learning:** Use prompts/exercises for applied questions.


  **Output Schema:** [paste flashcard_generation_schema here]. Generate exactly 40 flashcards covering all objectives/layers.
  Questions: 30% recall freq/tables, 40% apply/analyze samples, 30% evaluate/create. Distractors: Always 3, plausible (e.g.,
  swap E/T, claim works on AES). Ensure educational depth.'
