active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a debate format, argue whether Format-Preserving Encryption (FPE) like FF3 provides sufficient security
    for high-stakes data such as credit card numbers in legacy financial systems, considering trade-offs with traditional
    block cipher modes like CBC or GCM. Support arguments with real-world compliance examples like PCI DSS, NIST SP 800-38G
    security bounds, and potential vulnerabilities (e.g., domain size attacks).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ (4 options: 1 correct, 3 distractors): Distractors must be plausible based on common misconceptions/web
    research/voter priorities. E.g., For ''FF3 rounds?'': Correct:10 (AES-128); Distractors: 8 (FF1-like), 16 (AES block),
    unlimited (standard modes). Ensure 1 superficially similar, 1 opposite, 1 unrelated but crypto-term.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in cryptography. Topic: Format
  Preserving Encryption (FPE) FF3 (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 003_Symmetric Cryptography > 003_Block Cipher
  Modes > Confidentiality Modes > FPE FF3). Use provided research summary: FPE preserves format/length/radix via bijective
  permutation on domain (e.g., 16-digit PANs, radix 10); NIST SP 800-38G defines FF3-1 (AES-128 tweakable Feistel, 10 rounds,
  radix conv, cyclic shift); motivation: legacy DBs, PCI DSS. Voter consensus (82.9%): Emphasize NIST/FF1-FF3 diffs, pseudocode,
  security trade-offs vs CBC/GCM.
