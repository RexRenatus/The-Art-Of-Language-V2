  discussion_prompt: 'Does GDPR require encryption for all personal data processing, or is it risk-based? Debate using Articles
    5(1)(f) and 32, citing ICO guidance and a recent breach like the 2018 British Airways incident where lack of encryption
    contributed to fines. Consider: Is AES-256 always ''appropriate,'' or does it depend on context?'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Full Research Context (Completed):** GDPR (EU Regulation 2016/679) requires ''appropriate'' security for personal data.
  Article 5(1)(f): Integrity/confidentiality via technical measures like encryption. Article 32: Risk-based security considering
  state-of-the-art, costs, risks to rights/freedoms; examples include encryption/pseudonimisation. ICO (ico.org.uk): Encryption
  renders data unreadable without key; recommended for high-risk processing. Symmetric standards: AES-256-GCM (confidentiality
  + integrity/authenticated encryption). FIPS 140-3 (NIST, 2019+; supersedes 140-2): Validates cryptographic modules for federal
  use; best practice for GDPR ''state of the art'' (e.g., modules tested for AES impl.). Key lengths: 256-bit preferred for
  long-term security. Breaches: 2018 British Airways (no encryption, £20M fine).
