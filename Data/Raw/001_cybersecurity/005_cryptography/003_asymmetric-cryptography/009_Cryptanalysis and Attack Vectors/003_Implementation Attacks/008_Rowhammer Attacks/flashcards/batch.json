Victim-focused attacks exploit research showing that certain DRAM rows are inherently more vulnerable due to physical layout or manufacturing variations. By targeting these specific rows, attackers can achieve bit flips more reliably.",

        "analogy": "Imagine trying to break into a building with general security. A victim-focused attack is like finding a specific weak window or door that's easier to force open, bypassing the main security measures."

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Since DRAM chips are physical components that cannot be easily patched or updated after deployment, the inherent vulnerability persists. This necessitates ongoing research into system-level mitigations and defenses that can be implemented in hardware or software configurations.",
        "distractor_analysis": "While defenses improve, the fundamental nature of DRAM suggests continued susceptibility. Software patches can help but don't fix the hardware root cause. Rowhammer affects standard systems, not just niche ones.",
