active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a real-world e-commerce transaction using HTTPS, describe a key substitution attack scenario (e.g.,
    MITM substituting a public key during TLS handshake) and debate the most effective mitigations (e.g., HSTS, certificate
    pinning, key rotation). Address the misconception that all cryptographic keys are equally protected regardless of distribution
    method.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert educational flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity and cryptography. Generate
  20 high-quality flashcards on ''Key Substitution Attacks'' (Category: Cybersecurity, Domain: 001_Cryptography, Subdomain:

  CRITICAL NOTES: ''Key Substitution Attacks'' is NOT a universally standard term; it''s a conceptual category for key manipulation/replacement,
  often in MITM (e.g., substituting public keys in TLS/DH handshakes), exploiting key management flaws. Base content on provided
  research: Core concepts (crypto, keys, management), types (replacement/derivation), standards (NIST SP 800-57). Avoid inaccuracies.

  Ensure: University pedagogy (active recall, spaced repetition), web-grounded accuracy, engaging distractors per protocol.
  No criminal how-tos; focus on education/defenses.'
