This integration is crucial because many masking schemes rely on bitwise operations, and simplifying this reduces the overhead of masked implementations.",

When you're trying to build a secure structure (masked implementation), these easy-fitting blocks (moduli) make the construction process (masking operations) much smoother and less resource-intensive."

Their distinction lies in the number of traces used and the analytical method (single trace vs. statistical analysis).
