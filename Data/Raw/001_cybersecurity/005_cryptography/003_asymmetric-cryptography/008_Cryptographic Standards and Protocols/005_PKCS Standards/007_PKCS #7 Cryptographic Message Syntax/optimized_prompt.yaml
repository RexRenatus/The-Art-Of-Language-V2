  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the evolution from PKCS #7 to CMS (RFC 5652): What security vulnerabilities in the original PKCS
    #7 (e.g., limited support for certificate revocation) prompted changes, and how does CMS address modern PKI needs like
    extended hashing algorithms and timestamping? Reference key RFCs such as RFC 3369 and RFC 3852.'
  peer_teaching: 'Think-Pair-Share activity: (1) Individually, list and sketch the key components of a PKCS #7 message (e.g.,
    SignedData vs. EnvelopedData structures). (2) Pair up to compare notes, resolve misconceptions (e.g., confusing signing
    with encryption). (3) Share one insight or common error with the class to teach peers.'
  problem_solving: 'Real-world scenario: Secure firmware updates via code signing. Using OpenSSL, design a PKCS #7 workflow:
    (1) Hash the firmware with SHA-256, (2) Create a SignedData message with a private key, (3) Verify integrity and authenticity.
    Troubleshoot potential errors like invalid signatures or missing certificates.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in PKCS #7 Cryptographic Message
  Syntax (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 005_Asymmetric Cryptography > 008_Cryptographic Standards and
  Protocols > PKCS Standards > PKCS #7 CMS). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning components, scaffolding
  layers, and flashcard schema to generate high-quality, spaced-repetition-optimized flashcards.


  Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom''s progression, active recall, scaffolding from foundation to integration. Prerequisites:
  Asymmetric crypto, signatures, hashing.


  Research context: PKCS #7 defines syntax for protected messages (signing/encryption) in PKI; evolved to CMS via RFC 3369/3852/5652;
  content types: SignedData, EnvelopedData, etc.; OpenSSL implementation; apps: S/MIME, code signing.


  Generate exactly 25 flashcards following the schema: Output as JSON array of objects [{front: ''...'', back: {answer: ''...'',
  explanation: ''...'', bloom_level: ''...'', layer: ''...'', type: ''...''}}].


  Distribute: 8 REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND (Layers 1-2), 8 APPLY/ANALYZE (Layers 2-3), 9 EVALUATE/CREATE (Layers 3-4). 40% MCQ (with
  distractors), 20% definition, 20% fill-blank, 20% short answer. Ensure explanations tie to objectives/activities (e.g.,
  ''Relates to problem-solving firmware scenario''). No duplicates; promote deep understanding.'
