  discussion_prompt: 'In a multi-vendor environment, how does PKCS #15 promote interoperability for cryptographic tokens?
    Debate the trade-offs between standardization (PKCS #15) and proprietary formats, using real-world examples like banking
    smart cards vs. enterprise USB tokens.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

    related standards (e.g., PKCS #11 as ''data format''), 2) Misstate purpose (e.g., ''hardware API'' vs. ''info syntax''),
    3) Partial truths (e.g., ''only for smart cards'' vs. ''any token''). Ensure 1 correct, 3 wrong; explain why each wrong.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in PKCS #15 Cryptographic
  Token Information (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 005_Asymmetric 001_Cryptography > 008_Cryptographic
  Standards and Protocols > PKCS Standards > PKCS #15). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning components,
  4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema to generate high-quality, pedagogically optimized flashcards.


  **Context from Research:** PKCS #15 is the ''Cryptographic Token Information Syntax Standard'' defining a portable ASN.1
  format for credentials (keys, certs, PINs) on tokens (smart cards/USB). Promotes interoperability; complements PKCS #11
  (API). Solves vendor-specific data issues for PKI.


  **Incorporate:**

  - Learning Objectives: Cover all 6 (Remember to Create).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers (5-10 per layer).

  - Active Learning: Tag 20% cards to activities (e.g., ''Relates to discussion on interoperability'').

  - Bloom''s Progression: Build from recall to creation.


  **Output Format:** JSON array of objects, each: {''front'': str, ''back'': {''answer'': str, ''explanation'': str, ''bloom_level'':
  str, ''scaffolding_layer'': str, ''related_activity'': str|null}, ''type'': ''mcq|qa|cloze|matching'', ''options'': [array
  for MCQ]}. Generate exactly 30 cards. Ensure distractors follow protocol. Make explanations 2-4 sentences with web-grounded
  facts.'
