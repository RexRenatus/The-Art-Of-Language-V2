active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs between application-specific KDFs in SP 800-135 (e.g., for TLS, SSH, IPsec) and
    general-purpose KDFs like those in SP 800-108. In which scenarios do custom KDFs justify their use, and what risks arise
    from non-compliance with NIST recommendations? Debate security, interoperability, and implementation complexity.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - Research Context: NIST SP 800-135 Rev. 1 (2011) recommends security for application-specific KDFs (TLS, SSH, IPsec) using
  PRF/HMAC from shared secrets (e.g., DH). Keys for encryption/auth. Sources: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-135.pdf.

  - Learning Objectives: [insert array above].

  - Scaffolding: Distribute evenly across 4 layers [insert scaffolding array].

  - Active Learning: Draw from discussion/peer/problem-solving for scenario-based cards.

  - Coverage: 20% Layer1/REMEMBER-UNDERSTAND, 30% Layer2/APPLY, 30% Layer3/ANALYZE, 20% Layer4/EVALUATE-CREATE.


  Use Flashcard Schema [insert schema above]. Output ONLY valid JSON array of objects, each matching one structure type. No
  extra text. Ensure pedagogical depth: explanations tie to Bloom''s, prevent rote memorization via application/analysis.

  Big Picture: Essential for protocol security, interoperability, avoiding attacks like weak keys.'
