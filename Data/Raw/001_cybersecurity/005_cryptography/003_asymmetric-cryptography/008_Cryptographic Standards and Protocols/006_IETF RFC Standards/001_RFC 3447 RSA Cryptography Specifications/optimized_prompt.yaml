active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ongoing relevance of RFC 3447's PKCS#1 v1.5 schemes in modern systems
    despite known vulnerabilities (e.g., Bleichenbacher's padding oracle). Support your position with references to RFC 3447
    sections and its obsoletion by RFC 8017. What migration strategies would you recommend?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors from: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''PKCS#1 v1.5 is provably secure'' vs OAEP);
    2) Partial truths (e.g., wrong primitive: RSASP1 instead of RSAEP); 3) Outdated info (e.g., ignore obsoletion by RFC 8017);
    4) Numerical errors (e.g., forget mod n). Ensure 1-2 per card are plausible to trained eye.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education on RFC 3447: PKCS #1 RSA Cryptography Specifications\
  \ v2.1 (Category: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 005_Asymmetric > 008_Cryptographic Standards and Protocols > IETF RFC\
  \ Standards > RFC 3447).\n\nGenerate 50 high-quality flashcards covering all layers of scaffolding, spanning Bloom's levels\
  \ (use provided objectives). Incorporate voter priorities: Complete encoding methods (EME-OAEP, EME-PKCS1-v1_5, EMSA-PSS,\
  \ EMSA-PKCS1-v1_5 with MGF1); numerical examples; pseudocode snippets; misconceptions (e.g., no-padding security, v1.5 safety);\
  \ prior knowledge (modular arith, basic RSA); security comparisons; RFC 8017 obsoletion.\n\nUse this EXACT schema for each\
  \ card:\n{\n  'front': 'Question...',\n  'back': 'Answer...',\n  'explanation': 'Detailed...',\n  'distractors': ['A. Wrong...',\
  \ 'B. Correct (mark *)', ...] or null for non-MCQ,\n  'tags': ['Layer1', 'Bloom_REMEMBER', etc.]\n}\n\nOutput ONLY a JSON\
  \ array of 50 unique cards. Balance: 20% Layer1/REMEMBER-UNDERSTAND, 30% Layer2/APPLY, 30% Layer3/ANALYZE, 20% Layer4/EVALUATE-CREATE.\
  \ Include 10 MCQs with distractors per protocol. Vary formats: 40% cloze, 30% short answer, 30% MCQ. Ensure active learning\
  \ ties (e.g., 'Apply in peer teach'). Reference research: Primitives (RSAEP/RSADP/RSASP1/RSAVP1), I2OSP/OS2IP, schemes.\n\
  \nPrioritize spaced repetition: Core facts first, then procedures, analysis last."
