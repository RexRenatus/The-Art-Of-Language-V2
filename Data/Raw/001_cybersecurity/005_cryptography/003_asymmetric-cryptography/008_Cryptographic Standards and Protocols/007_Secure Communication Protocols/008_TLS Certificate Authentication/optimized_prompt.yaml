active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of using self-signed certificates in internal networks versus CA-issued certificates
    for public-facing services. Consider security risks (e.g., MITM attacks), compliance with CA/Browser Forum BR, and operational
    costs. Support arguments with real-world examples like Heartbleed or Log4Shell impacts on TLS.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use for contextual explanations (e.g., ''Relates to peer teaching on handshake'').

  - Scaffolding: Tag and reference Layers 1-4 explicitly.

  - Prior Knowledge: Link to asymmetric crypto basics.

  - Research Context: TLS auth prevents MITM; key concepts (certs, CAs, PKI); standards (CA/Browser Forum BR 2.1.7, RFC 5280);
  tools (openssl s_client, browser dev tools).

  - Voter Consensus: 100% approval on pedagogy, completeness (full BR details), scaffolding, engagement.
