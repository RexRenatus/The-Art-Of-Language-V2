active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast SSH public key authentication with password-based authentication in terms of security,
    usability, and scalability. What are the key risks if private keys are compromised, and how can they be mitigated in a
    large-scale environment?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - 'RFC inaccuracies: Wrong RFC numbers (e.g., RFC 4251 as Transport Layer).'
  - 'Security pitfalls: Incorrect permissions (e.g., 644 on private key), no passphrase.'
  - 'Plausible alternatives: Similar commands/tools (e.g., scp vs ssh-copy-id).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Topic: SSH Public Key Authentication (Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 005_Asymmetric Cryptography > 008_Cryptographic Standards and Protocols > Secure Communication
  Protocols > SSH Public Key Authentication). Use the provided research context: SSH uses asymmetric keys (private secret,
  public shared); process per RFC 4251 (Architecture), RFC 4252 (Authentication); commands like ssh-keygen, ssh-copy-id.
