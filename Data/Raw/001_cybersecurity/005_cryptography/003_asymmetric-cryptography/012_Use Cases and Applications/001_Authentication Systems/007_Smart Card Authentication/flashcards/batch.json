        "core_logic": "A compromised reader is a risk because malware on the host system could potentially log keystrokes (PIN) or interfere with the communication channel between the card and the host, because the card's secure element is designed to prevent direct key compromise. This functions by targeting the interface and user input, connecting to the importance of securing the entire authentication path.",

Forcing the card to sign arbitrary data usually requires bypassing PIN authorization, which malware typically cannot do directly. Firmware corruption is a more advanced attack vector than typical reader malware.",
