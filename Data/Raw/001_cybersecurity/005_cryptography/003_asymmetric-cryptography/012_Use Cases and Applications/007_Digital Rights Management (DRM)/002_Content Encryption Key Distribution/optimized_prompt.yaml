active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of DRM for streaming services like Netflix, debate the trade-offs between using asymmetric
    cryptography for initial key exchange versus hybrid approaches with CEKs. What are the risks if keys are distributed insecurely,
    and how do NIST SP 800-57 guidelines address these?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''CEK is asymmetric''), 2) Partial
    truth (e.g., ''Key distribution uses only symmetric crypto''), 3) Extreme/unrealistic (e.g., ''Distribute keys in plaintext
    for speed''). Base on voter suggestions and research (e.g., confuse CEK with asymmetric keys). Ensure distractors test
    deeper understanding.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Topic: Content Encryption Key Distribution
  (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 005_Asymmetric > 014_Use Cases and Applications > Digital Rights Management
  (DRM) > Content Encryption Key Distribution). Use this research: CEK (symmetric for content), Key Distribution (secure transfer),
  KMS (lifecycle management), NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 Rev. 5 (key management guidance: types, protection, functions), SP 800-130
  (lifecycle). Integrate pedagogy: Objectives [paste learning_objectives array]. Active learning [paste active_learning].
  Scaffolding [paste scaffolding].


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards per the schema: Mix basic, cloze, MCQ. Use distractor protocol. Cover all Bloom''s levels
  progressively via scaffolding. Ensure web-grounded (NIST refs), voter consensus (hybrid DRM, MITM). Output ONLY valid JSON
  array of flashcards matching schema structure. No extra text.'
