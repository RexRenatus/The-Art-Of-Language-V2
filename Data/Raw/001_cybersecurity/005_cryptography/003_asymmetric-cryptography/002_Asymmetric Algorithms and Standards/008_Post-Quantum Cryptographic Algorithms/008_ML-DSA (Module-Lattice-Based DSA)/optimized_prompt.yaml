  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the urgency of migrating to ML-DSA given the 10-20 year quantum threat
    timeline: What risks remain with classical signatures (e.g., Shor''s algorithm on RSA/ECDSA), and how does ML-DSA''s lattice
    foundation mitigate them? Cite NIST PQC strategy.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on ''ML-DSA (Module-Lattice-Based DSA)'' using the provided schema. Topic Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 005_Asymmetric Cryptography > 002_Asymmetric Algorithms and Standards > Post-Quantum
  Cryptographic Algorithms > ML-DSA. Incorporate: Learning objectives [paste objectives array]; Active learning for context
  [paste active_learning]; Scaffolding layers [paste scaffolding_layers]; Prior knowledge: RSA/ECDSA basics, Shor''s algorithm;
  Big picture: NIST PQC for quantum-resistant sigs (FIPS 204, RFC 9882); Visuals: Lattice diagrams, parameter tables.


  Key content: ML-DSA = lattice-based DSA (ex-Dilithium); Provides authenticity/integrity/non-repudiation; Params: ML-DSA-44
  (sig~2420B), -65(~3309B), -87(~4595B); Hardness: Module-LWE/SIS; Processes: KeyGen/Sign/Verify with rejection sampling.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each matching EXACTLY this schema: {front: str, back: str, type: ''basic|cloze|mcq'',
  bloom_level: str, scaffolding_layer: 1-4, explanation: str}. For MCQ, embed options in front/back (e.g., front: ''Q?

  A)opt1 B)opt2...''; back: ''Correct: B. Distractors: ...''). Follow distractor protocol strictly. Ensure pedagogical balance,
  active recall, no hints in front. Vary difficulty progressively by layer/Bloom.'
