  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using Static DH in modern protocols like TLS: Does its
    efficiency outweigh the lack of forward secrecy? Provide evidence from NIST SP 800-56A and real-world breaches (e.g.,
    compromised long-term keys).'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Plausible based on misconceptions: e.g., confuse static with ephemeral (distractor: ''provides forward secrecy''),
      mix up public/private roles, wrong computation (e.g., g^{a+b} instead of shared secret), outdated standards.'
    - 'Vary difficulty: 1 easy (definition swap), 1 medium (parameter mix-up), 1 hard (trade-off nuance).'
    - Ensure 20-30% flashcards per scaffolding layer; balance Bloom's levels.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Cryptography (Domain: 001_Cryptography,
  Subdomain: 005_Asymmetric, Entry: 002_Asymmetric Algorithms and Standards > Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange > Static Diffie-Hellman).

  Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema: FRONT (question with 4 MCQ options or cloze, note Bloom''s
  level and layer), BACK (bold answer, 50-100 word explanation with NIST SP 800-56A/RFC refs, misconception correction, example),
  REFERENCES (layer/objective).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert full 4 layers above, including numerical ex p=23 g=5, best practices: no forward secrecy,
  hybrid ephemeral, cert-embedded]

  - Active Learning: Draw from discussion/trade-offs, peer examples, problem-solving.

  - Content Completeness: Link to basic DH; big picture NIST SP 800-56A key establishment; best practices: static values in
  X.509 certs, risks (no FS), hybrid recommendations.

  - Distractor Protocol: [insert full protocol above].


  Balance: 10 cards/layer, span Bloom''s (Remember 15%, Understand 20%, Apply 20%, Analyze 20%, Evaluate 15%, Create 10%);
  20% numerical, 20% scenarios, 20% best practices. Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition friendly,
  misconception-proof. Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': {...}, ''back'': {...}, ''references'': {...}}].'
