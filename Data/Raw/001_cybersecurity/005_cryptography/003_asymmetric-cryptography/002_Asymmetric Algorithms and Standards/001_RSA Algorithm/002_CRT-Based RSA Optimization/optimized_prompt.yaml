active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the performance gains of RSA-CRT (e.g., ~4x speedup in decryption/signing) versus naive RSA
    decryption. What security risks, like side-channel attacks (timing, SPA, DPA), arise from this optimization, and how can
    they be mitigated (e.g., blinding, constant-time implementations)? Debate in groups whether the speed benefits outweigh
    the risks in real-world deployments like TLS servers.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (20% of cards): 4 options (1 correct, 3 distractors). Distractors from: 1) Common errors
    (e.g., ''CRT used for encryption too'' - no, only private ops); 2) Partial truths (e.g., ''2x speedup'' - actually ~4x);
    3) Confusions (e.g., ''Requires strong primes only for key gen'' - also resists attacks); 4) Irrelevants (e.g., ''Symmetric
    crypto speedup''). Ensure plausible, derived from misconceptions in RSA/CRT.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for university-level cybersecurity education on ''CRT-Based RSA Optimization''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 005_Asymmetric Cryptography > 002_Asymmetric Algorithms and Standards
  > RSA Algorithm > CRT-Based RSA Optimization). Use Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives: [insert learning_objectives array here].
  Incorporate scaffolding layers: [insert scaffolding_layers array here]. Prerequisites: RSA basics, modular arithmetic. Sources:
  RFC 8017 (PKCS#1 v2.2), IETF drafts on RSA, OpenSSL implementations.


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (10 per Bloom''s level, balanced across layers/types: 20% definition/REMEMBER, 20% explanation/UNDERSTAND,
  20% cloze/procedure/APPLY, 20% MCQ/comparison/ANALYZE, 10% evaluation, 10% create/open-ended). Promote active recall: questions
  test deep understanding, not rote.


  Active learning integration: Cards reference discussion/problem-solving (e.g., ''Relate to timing comparison exercise'').
  Big picture: CRT ~4x speeds private ops for TLS.


  Follow exact schema: [insert flashcard_schema.structure here]. Use distractor protocol for MCQs. Ensure explanations tie
  to objectives/layers. Output ONLY the JSON array of flashcards, no extra text.'
