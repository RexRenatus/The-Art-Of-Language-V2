active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a world where Certificate Transparency (CT) logs are mandatory for public CAs, discuss whether this
    sufficiently mitigates risks from compromised CAs, using examples like the 2011 DigiNotar breach. What additional measures
    (e.g., OCSP stapling, multi-perspective validation) could enhance trust? (Encourages critical thinking on trust models
    and real-world failures.)
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    identity'' (confuses with RA); for NIST, mix TLS 1.0/1.1 as allowed; for prohibited uses, include ''weak hashes like SHA-1''
    as allowed (it''s prohibited). Ensure 70% plausible (real terms), 30% obvious errors. Balance across layers/objectives.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education on ''TLS/SSL Server Certificates'' (Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 005_Asymmetric > 009_PKI > Specialized PKI Apps > TLS/SSL Server Certificates). Use the
  provided learning_objectives, active_learning activities, scaffolding_layers (4 layers), and flashcard_schema to generate
  high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized flashcards.


  Incorporate: University pedagogy (Bloom''s progression), voter consensus (e.g., NIST SP 800-52 full details: TLS 1.2+, ECDHE
  ciphers, cert profiles; prohibited uses per CA/B BR; DigiNotar example), web research (PKI roles, TLS 1.3, RFCs), prior
  links (asymmetric crypto/signatures), big picture (PKI prevents MITM).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcards, each matching flashcard_schema exactly: {front: ''...'', back: {answer: ''...'',
  explanation: ''...'', bloom_level: ''...'', layer: 1-4, distractors: [''opt1'', ''opt2'']}}. Ensure variety, measurability,
  and distractor_protocol. No extra text.'
