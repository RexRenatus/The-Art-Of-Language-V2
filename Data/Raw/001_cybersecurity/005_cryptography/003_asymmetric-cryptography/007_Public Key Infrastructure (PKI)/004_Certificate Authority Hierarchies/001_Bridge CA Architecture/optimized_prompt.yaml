  Research Context: Bridge CA is a trusted intermediary CA enabling cross-certification between independent PKIs (e.g., via
  short-lived cross-certs). Key standards: NIST SP 800-57 Parts 1-3 (Key Management), SP 800-32 (PKI Intro & Federal Bridge).
  Federal Bridge CA (FBCA) example interconnects U.S. gov PKIs. Core concepts: CA issues certs binding keys to identities;
  PKI manages cert lifecycle; Root CA self-signed trust anchor; Cross-cert establishes mutual trust; Cert chain validates
  from end-entity to root. Risks: Compromise affects multiple PKIs; Mitigate with CRL/OCSP, name constraints.
