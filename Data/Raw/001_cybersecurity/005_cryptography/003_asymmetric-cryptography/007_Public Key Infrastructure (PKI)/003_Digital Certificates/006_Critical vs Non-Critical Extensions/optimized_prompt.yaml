  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the trade-offs of marking an extension like CRL Distribution Points as critical versus non-critical
    in a high-security enterprise PKI: When might over-reliance on criticality lead to unnecessary certificate rejections,
    and how does this impact usability? Support with RFC 5280 references.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - 'Distractor 2: Partial truth/reversal (e.g., ''Process only if recognized, else warn'' instead of reject)'
  - 'Distractor 3: Edge case confusion (e.g., ''Always reject regardless of criticality'' or legacy behavior)'
  - Ensure distractors are plausible based on voter-noted pitfalls like incomplete best practices or misclassified extensions
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in PKI and X.509 certificates.
  Topic: ''Critical vs Non-Critical Extensions'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 005_Asymmetric Cryptography
  > 009_Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) > Digital Certificates > Critical vs Non-Critical Extensions). Use this research context:
  [Insert full research context here, completed: Core concepts as provided; RFC 5280 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280):
  Profiles X.509v3; critical extensions must be processed or cert rejected by relying party''s systems (e.g., browsers like
  Chrome reject unknowns); examples: Critical - Key Usage (limits key purposes), Basic Constraints (CA flag); Non-Critical
  - SubjectAltName (extra names), CRL DP (revocation info). Best practices: Set criticality per use (minimize critical to
  avoid rejections); test with OpenSSL; CA/B Forum rules. Sources: RFC 5280, Mozilla NSS docs.]
