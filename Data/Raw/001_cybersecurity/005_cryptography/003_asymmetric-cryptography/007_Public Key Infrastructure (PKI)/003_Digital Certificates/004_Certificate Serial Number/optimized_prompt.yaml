learning_objectives:
  remember:
  - objective: Define a certificate serial number and its basic purpose in an X.509 digital certificate.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  evaluate:
  - objective: Critique best practices for serial number generation, such as minimum 64-bit length per CA/Browser Forum guidelines,
      and assess risks of poor implementation (e.g., collisions leading to revocation issues).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Identify the certificate serial number in a sample X.509 certificate using tools like OpenSSL.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  analyze:
  - objective: Compare the uniqueness requirements for certificate serial numbers as specified in RFC 5280 (unique per issuer/CA)
      versus common misconceptions like global uniqueness.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  understand:
  - objective: Explain the role of the certificate serial number in distinguishing certificates within a Certificate Authority
      (CA)'s namespace and its contribution to the PKI trust model.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  create:
  - objective: Design a policy for generating secure certificate serial numbers, including collision avoidance strategies
      and compliance with RFC 5280.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
