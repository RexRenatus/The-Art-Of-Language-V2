active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a PKI system, is a dedicated Validation Authority (VA) essential, or can its functions be adequately
    handled by CAs or OCSP responders? Debate using ETSI standards vs. NIST SP 800-63 guidelines, considering voter concerns
    about term accuracy and citing sources to support your position.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Base on voter accuracy concerns: Include NIST-only terms or non-PKI ''VA'' (e.g., aviation).'
    - 'Plausible errors: Mix roles (e.g., ''Issues certificates'' for VA), outdated terms.'
    - '3 distractors max: 1 subtle (near-synonym), 1 common confusion, 1 unrelated.'
    - Ensure 70% focus on PKI validation pitfalls.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in PKI. Topic: Validation
  Authority (VA) in PKI Components and Architecture (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 005_Asymmetric Cryptography
  > 009_Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) > PKI Components and Architecture > Validation Authority (VA)).


  Voter consensus: No (0% approval), all priorities on accuracy/completeness—VA not in NIST SP 800-63; use ETSI EN 319 411-2/TS
  119 432, RFC 5280/6960 for definitions (VA provides certificate status/path validation, akin to OCSP). Cite sources; note
  alternatives (OCSP Responder, CRL issuer).
