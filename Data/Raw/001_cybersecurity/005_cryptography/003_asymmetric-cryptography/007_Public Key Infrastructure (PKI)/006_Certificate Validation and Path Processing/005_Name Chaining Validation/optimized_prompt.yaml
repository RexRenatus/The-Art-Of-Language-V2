active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Analyze a scenario where name chaining fails in a corporate PKI deployment (e.g., due to a name mismatch
    from whitespace or encoding errors). Debate mitigation strategies, real-world impacts (similar to DigiNotar breach), and
    whether name chaining should be prioritized over other validation steps like revocation checks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs based on common pitfalls: 1) whitespace/encoding mismatch (e.g., ''CN=CA''
      vs. ''CN= CA''), 2) confusion with SKI/AKI (key-based vs. name-based), 3) unrelated fields (e.g., serial number or validity
      dates), 4) reversal (subject before issuer).'
    - Ensure distractors are realistic from real-world errors (e.g., case sensitivity debates in RFC 5280).

  **Core Content (Web-Grounded, Accurate per RFC 5280):** Name chaining validation verifies that the issuer DN of certificate
  N matches the subject DN of certificate N+1 in a PKI chain (RFC 5280 Section 6.1). Key standards: RFC 5280 (Internet X.509
  PKI Certificate and CRL Profile), NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 (Key Management). Pitfalls: whitespace, encoding, case sensitivity.
  Use OpenSSL examples.


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Align flashcards to these Bloom''s objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE].

  - Scaffold across 4 layers: [INSERT scaffolding ARRAY HERE].

  - Incorporate active learning: [INSERT active_learning OBJECT HERE].


  **Output 60 flashcards in JSON array format:**

  [{ "id": 1, "layer": 1, "bloom_level": "REMEMBER", "type": "MCQ", "front": "Question text", "back": { "answer": "Correct
  answer", "explanation": "Rationale with RFC ref", "hints": "Layer tie-in", "references": ["RFC 5280 §6.1"] } }, ...]


  **Flashcard Rules:** Follow [INSERT flashcard_schema HERE]. Ensure university-level rigor: active recall, spaced repetition
  friendly, distractors from pitfalls. Cover hierarchy fully, no NIST SP 800-63 (IAM-focused, irrelevant).'
