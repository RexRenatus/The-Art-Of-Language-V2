active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how RFC 3161 addresses replay attacks in digital signatures compared to
    simple clock-based timestamps. Provide examples from real-world cybersecurity scenarios like legal evidence or financial
    transactions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    hash only); 2) Related but wrong term (e.g., ''TGT'' vs. TST); 3) Inverse/error (e.g., ''Client signs'' vs. TSA). Base
    on research/voter errors like incomplete steps.'

  Use this optimized content for generation:

  [Insert full scaffolding layers here, including prior knowledge, concept map, big picture, complete workflow from voters/research].


  Learning Objectives: [list all 6].

  Active Learning: Incorporate hints tying to discussion/peer/problem-solving.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following the exact schema:

  - Balance by Bloom''s/scaffolding.

  - MCQs: 40% with distractors per protocol.

  - Cloze/Short Answer: Promote active recall.

  - Explanations: Reference objectives/layers/research (e.g., ''Per Layer 3, TSA generates...'').

  - Ensure university pedagogy: Scaffolding builds progressively; objectives measurable.
