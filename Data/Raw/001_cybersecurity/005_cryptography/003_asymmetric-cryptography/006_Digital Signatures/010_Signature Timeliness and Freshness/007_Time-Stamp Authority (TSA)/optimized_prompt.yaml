active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss the vulnerabilities in TSA systems (e.g., clock accuracy, reliance on certificate chains, or
    hash collisions) and evaluate mitigation strategies like clock synchronization protocols or multi-TSA redundancy. How
    does this impact non-repudiation in legal contexts like contract timestamping?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    full data instead of hash''; ''TSA provides time without cryptographic binding''; ''Verification skips certificate chain'';
    ''Timestamp can be backdated without bounds check''. Ensure distractors are 80% plausible (common errors) to promote active
    recall.'

  Incorporate these elements for optimized, university-level flashcards:


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s Taxonomy):** [Paste the full ''learning_objectives'' array here].


  **Active Learning Components:** [Paste the full ''active_learning'' object here]. Embed prompts or scenarios from these
  into 20% of cards (e.g., ''Using the peer teaching simulation, what is the first verification step?'').


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Paste the full ''scaffolding'' object here]. Distribute cards: Layer 1 (foundation, 20%), Layer
  2 (components, 25%), Layer 3 (implementation, 30% incl. full verification: hash match, sig valid, chain, time bounds, clock
  sync), Layer 4 (integration, 25%).


  **Voter Consensus & Research:** 82.9% approval. Complete verification process. Use RFC 3161 (TSP: hash requests, tokens).
  Key concepts: proof-of-existence, TTP, non-repudiation, PKI integration. Misconceptions: TSA signs data (not hash), no chain
  checks.


  **Flashcard Generation Rules:** Follow exact ''flashcard_schema'' [Paste full schema here]. Generate 25-30 high-quality
  cards. Use active recall (no verbatim copies). MCQs: 1 correct, 3 distractors. Ensure scaffolding progression. Output ONLY
  the JSON array of flashcards, no extra text.'
