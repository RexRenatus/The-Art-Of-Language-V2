        "distractor_analysis": "While CSPRNGs aim for uniqueness, unpredictability is the key security feature. Speed is secondary to security. CSPRNGs generate random numbers, not encrypted data.",
        "analogy": "Using a CSPRNG for a salt is like using a unique, unpredictable secret code word for each password. If the code word is guessable, the password's security is weakened. A CSPRNG ensures the code word is a surprise."
