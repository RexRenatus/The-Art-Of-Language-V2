active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Preimage resistance is the most critical property of
    hash functions for digital signatures.'' Provide evidence from NIST standards (e.g., FIPS 180-4) and real-world examples
    like blockchain or password storage, considering scenarios where other properties (second preimage, collision) might be
    equally vital.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Common misconceptions (e.g., confuse preimage with collision)
    - Superficially similar terms (e.g., 'second preimage' as distractor for preimage)
    - Edge cases or weak hashes (e.g., MD5 broken for collisions)
    - Plausible but incorrect values (e.g., 2^128 instead of 2^256 for SHA-256 security)

  Resistance (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 005_Asymmetric Cryptography > 006_Digital Signatures > Hash Functions
  for Signatures > Preimage Resistance). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities, 4-layer scaffolding,
  and flashcard schema to generate 50 high-quality Anki-style flashcards.


  Incorporate research context: Preimage resistance (NIST): Computationally infeasible to find input for given hash output
  (''one-way''). Hash properties: Deterministic, efficient, preimage/second-preimage/collision resistant. NIST FIPS 180-4
  (SHA family): https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/180/4/final. CSRC Glossary: https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/preimage_resistance.
  Examples: Digital signatures (hash message, sign digest), password storage, blockchain.


  Distribute cards across Bloom''s levels and scaffolding layers. Map to objectives/activities (e.g., APPLY cards simulate
  problem-solving). Strictly follow flashcard schema: Front (question), Back (answer + explanation + bloom_level + scaffolding_layer
  + source). For MCQs, use distractor protocol. Ensure university pedagogy: Active recall, scaffolding progression, no hints
  on front. Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''source'': ''...''}}, ...]. Vary question types for engagement.'
