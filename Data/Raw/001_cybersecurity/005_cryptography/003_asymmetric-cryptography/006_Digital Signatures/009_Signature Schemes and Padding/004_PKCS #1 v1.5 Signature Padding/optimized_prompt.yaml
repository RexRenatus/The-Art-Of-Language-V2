  discussion_prompt: 'Why has PKCS #1 v1.5 signature padding been largely superseded by RSA-PSS in modern standards? Discuss
    specific security flaws, such as vulnerability to Bleichenbacher padding oracle attacks due to its deterministic nature,
    and debate whether legacy systems (e.g., older TLS implementations) should be forced to migrate despite compatibility
    risks.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in cryptography. Topic: PKCS
  #1 v1.5 Signature Padding (Category: Cybersecurity; Domain: 001_Cryptography; Subdomain: 005_Asymmetric Cryptography; Entry
  Domain: 006_Digital Signatures; Entry Subdomain: Signature Schemes and Padding; Full Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography
  > 005_Asymmetric Cryptography > 006_Digital Signatures > Signature Schemes and Padding > PKCS #1 v1.5 Signature Padding).


  Key Facts (accuracy paramount): Signature padding = 0x00 || 0x01 || PS (0xFF* bytes to fill) || 0x00 || DigestInfo (DER:
  alg ID + hash). Deterministic (no random). Differs from encryption (0x00 || 0x02 || non-zero random || 0x00 || M). Vulnerabilities:
  Bleichenbacher oracles, existential forgery. Superseded by RSA-PSS.
