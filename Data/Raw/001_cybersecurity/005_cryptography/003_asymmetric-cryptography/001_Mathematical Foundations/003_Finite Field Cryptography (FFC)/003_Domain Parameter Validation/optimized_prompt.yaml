  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [paste the learning_objectives array here]

  - Active learning: Use for inspiration (e.g., scenario-based Qs).

  - Scaffolding: [paste scaffolding_layers here]. Tag cards by layer.

  - Research: NIST SP 800-56A/57 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/), RFC 3647 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3647),
