active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Why are prime moduli essential in asymmetric cryptography like Diffie-Hellman or DSA? Compare the security
    implications of using a prime versus a composite modulus, citing real-world examples from NIST standards (e.g., subgroup
    confinement attacks in DH with composite moduli) and historical failures like the ROCA vulnerability.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Research Context Summary:** Prime modulus is a large prime p for modular arithmetic in RSA/DH/DSA, ensuring finite field
  GF(p) security. NIST SP 800-57 Pt1 Rev5: Key mgmt, 2048+ bit primes for DH/DSA. FIPS 186-5: DSA primes. SP 800-56A: Safe
  primes (p=2q+1) vs strong primes. SP 800-133: Implementation. Generation: Miller-Rabin. Vulnerabilities: Composites enable
  Pollard''s rho. Sources: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r5.pdf, https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.186-5,
