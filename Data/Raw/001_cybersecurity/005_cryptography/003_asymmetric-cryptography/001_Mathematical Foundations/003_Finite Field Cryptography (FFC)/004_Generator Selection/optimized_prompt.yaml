  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the security implications of using a non-primitive generator in Diffie-Hellman:
    How does it enable small subgroup attacks? Propose mitigations and evaluate their feasibility in resource-constrained
    environments like IoT devices.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., confuse primitive root with RNG seed from NIST SP 800-90).'
    - 'Distractor 2: Partial truth (e.g., valid for small subgroup but not full order q).'
    - 'Distractor 3: Edge case error (e.g., g=1 or -1, fails small subgroup test).'
    - 'Balance: 40% accuracy-focused (voter priority), 30% pedagogy (Bloom''s mislevel), 30% completeness (missing NIST 800-56A).'
    count_per_card: Exactly 3 distractors, plausible to experts but wrong for learners.
