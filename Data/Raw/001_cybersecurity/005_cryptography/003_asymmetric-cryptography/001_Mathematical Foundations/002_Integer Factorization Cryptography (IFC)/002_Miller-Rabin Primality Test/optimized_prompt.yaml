  discussion_prompt: 'In groups, debate the trade-offs of using probabilistic tests like Miller-Rabin in cryptography versus
    deterministic methods: When is the tiny error probability acceptable, and how does it impact RSA key security? Cite the
    error bound <4^{-k}.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., Fermat condition only), 3) edge case reversal (e.g., prime declared composite). Ensure distractors are plausible
    for learners at prior knowledge level.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for university-level cybersecurity education on the Miller-Rabin Primality
  Test (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 005_Asymmetric 001_Cryptography > 001_Mathematical Foundations
  > Integer Factorization 001_Cryptography (IFC) > Miller-Rabin Primality Test). Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using
  the exact schema provided below. Incorporate these pedagogical elements:


  **Learning Objectives:** [REMEMBER: Define key terms... CREATE: Design pseudocode...] Ensure cards target these levels.


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Layer 1: Foundation... Layer 4: Integration...] Tag each card to a layer.


  **Active Learning Integration:** Draw from discussion (error trade-offs), peer teaching (squaring steps), problem-solving
  (n=561, RSA).


  **Voter Consensus (100% approval):** Include worked examples n=13 (prime, a=2), n=91 (composite, a=2); full algorithm with
  failure cases (no -1 after squarings → composite); error <4^{-k}; pseudocode; prerequisites (mod arith, Fermat).


  **Research Context:** Probabilistic test; if conditions fail for base a, composite; strong probable prime passes; based
  on n-1=2^s d conditions.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"front": "...", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "distractors":
  ["...","...","..."]}, "metadata": {"bloom_level": "...", "scaffolding_layer": #, "type": "..."}}. Follow distractor protocol
  strictly. Ensure explanations reference examples, math, and crypto relevance. Balance card types and Bloom''s levels as
  in schema.'
