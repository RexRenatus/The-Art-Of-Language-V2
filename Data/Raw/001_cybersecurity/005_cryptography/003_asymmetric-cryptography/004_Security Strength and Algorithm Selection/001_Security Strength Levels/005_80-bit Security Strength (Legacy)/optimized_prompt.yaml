active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Based on NIST SP 800-131A Rev. 2, argue for or against allowing 80-bit security in non-sensitive legacy
    applications today. Consider computational advances (e.g., GPU clusters at 10^15 ops/sec), migration costs, and real-world
    breaches like those involving RSA-1024 in older TLS implementations. What misconceptions about 'eternal security' does
    this reveal? Counterarguments from peers should reference NIST SP 800-57 security strength tables.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Core Content (Research Context - Completed/Expanded per NIST SP 800-57/131A Rev. 2):** Security strength = bits of computational
  effort (2^n operations) for brute-force. 80-bit legacy: Adequate historically but deprecated due to computing advances.
  Examples: RSA-1024 (~80-bit), DSA-1024, Triple DES (80-bit effective). NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 defines strengths; Part 2 outlines
  security strengths for algorithms/key sizes. SP 800-131A Rev. 2: Deprecate <112-bit; RSA-1024 post-2010 new systems ban,
  2030 full. Current: 128/192/256-bit min. Quantum: Grover reduces to 40-bit effective.
