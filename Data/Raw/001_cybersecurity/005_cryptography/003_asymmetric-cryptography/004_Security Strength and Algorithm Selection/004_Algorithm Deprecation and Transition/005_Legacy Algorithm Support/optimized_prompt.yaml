  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs: 1 correct, 3 distractors. Distractors must be plausible (e.g., common misconceptions like
    ''1024-bit RSA is secure until 2033'' vs. actual NIST disallowance after 2030; outdated dates; confusing symmetric/asymmetric;
    mixing key lengths like 2048 vs. 3072). Base on voter-noted misconceptions and real NIST edge cases. Ensure 1-2 distractors
    are ''close but wrong'' (e.g., approved alternative misidentified as legacy).'

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste full array from ''learning_objectives'']

  - Active Learning: Use as context for scenario cards (e.g., debate prompts as evaluative questions). [Paste full from ''active_learning_components'']

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [Paste full from ''scaffolding_layers''], tagging each.

  - Examples: Legacy (DES, SHA-1, RSA<2048, 1024-bit RSA); Modern (AES-256, SHA-3, ECDSA P-384, post-quantum). Sources: NIST
  SP 800-131A Rev. 2 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-131Ar2), SP 800-57 Pt1 Rev5 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r5).
  Best Practices: Inventory, risk assess, phased migration, testing, monitoring.


  Generate flashcards strictly per this schema: [Paste full ''flashcard_schema'']. Output ONLY a JSON array of objects, e.g.,
  [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}}, ...]. Ensure high-quality, active recall, spaced repetition friendly (Anki-compatible).
  Voter consensus: 82.9% approval emphasizes completeness, pedagogy, NIST citations.'
