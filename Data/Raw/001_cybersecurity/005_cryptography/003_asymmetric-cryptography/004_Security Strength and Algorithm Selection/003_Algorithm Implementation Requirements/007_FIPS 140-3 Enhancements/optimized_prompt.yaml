active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of FIPS 140-3's stricter security levels (e.g., SL4 requirements)
    on implementation costs versus enhanced protection for CUI in government vendors. Support arguments with specific enhancements
    like side-channel protections.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - '1 distractor: Over/under-statement of enhancement (e.g., ''No post-quantum support'' vs. ''Full PQ algorithms required'').'

  **Completed Research Context (Voter-Completed for Completeness):**

  FIPS 140-3 supersedes FIPS 140-2 (sunset by 2026), aligns with ISO/IEC 19790:2012 (mechanisms) and 24759:2017 (testing).
  Protects CUI/SBU via cryptographic modules (hw/sw/fw).

  **Key Enhancements/Differences from FIPS 140-2:**

  - **Security Levels:** Qualitative SL1-SL4 (SL1: basic; SL2: roles/non-volatile; SL3: identity/tamper-evident; SL4: env
  failure protection). No more quantitative bits.

  - **Clearer Rules:** Explicit on module partitioning, ports/interfaces (logical/physical), key zeroization (immediate/full),
  operational env.

  - **Self-Tests:** Enhanced power-up/conditional; mandatory pair-wise consistency for asymmetric key gen (e.g., RSA/ECDSA).

  - **Side-Channel Protections:** Stronger mitigations (timing/power analysis) across levels.

  - **Post-Quantum Readiness:** References NIST PQ algorithms; future-proofing for migration.

  - **Other:** Updated module types (e.g., hybrid), CMVP process (NIST/Canadian labs), approved algos list dynamic via NIST.
