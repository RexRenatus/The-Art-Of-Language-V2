active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios would using a signature key pair for encryption compromise security, and vice versa?
    Debate the risks using real-world examples like code signing certificates (where private signature keys must remain secret)
    versus HTTPS traffic (where public encryption keys protect confidentiality). Consider common misconceptions about interchangeable
    key uses.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ targeting Bloom''s levels: 1 based on role reversal (e.g.,
    ''private key encrypts''), 1 on type swap (e.g., ''signature key for confidentiality''), 1 on symmetric confusion (e.g.,
    ''single key for both''). Ensure distractors are realistic errors from real-world breaches or NIST warnings.'

  Topic: Signature vs Encryption Keys (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 005_Asymmetric Cryptography > 005_Key
  Establishment and Management > Key Pair Types and Properties > Signature vs Encryption Keys). Use this research context:
  Asymmetric keys have public (shareable: encrypt or verify) and private (secret: decrypt or sign) roles. Encryption keys
  ensure confidentiality (public encrypts, private decrypts); signature keys ensure authenticity/integrity (private signs,
  public verifies). NIST SP 800-57 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-57sp800-57part1rev3.pdf)
  guides key management. Big picture: Prevents errors in HTTPS, PGP, code signing.
