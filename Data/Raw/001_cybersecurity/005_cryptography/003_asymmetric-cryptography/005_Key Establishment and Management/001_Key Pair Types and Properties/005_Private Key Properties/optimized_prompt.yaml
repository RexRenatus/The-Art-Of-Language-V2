active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: If a private key is compromised, what are the implications for digital signatures and encryption? Debate
    using real-world examples like the 2010 RSA SecurID breach or cryptocurrency wallet hacks, considering compare/contrast
    with public key exposure.
  peer_teaching: Students pair up; one explains private key use in decryption with examples (e.g., PGP email), the partner
    teaches its use in signing with non-examples; switch roles and use teach-back to verify understanding.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario where a company's private key for SSL certificates is stored insecurely on a developer's
    laptop, design a key management solution using HSMs or cloud KMS. Evaluate risks, propose mitigations, and simulate key
    generation/compromise using tools like Crypto101.

    (2) Related but incorrect property (e.g., ''1024-bit length is sufficient''); (3) Extreme/overstated (e.g., ''Infinite
    entropy required''). Ensure distractors test subtle misunderstandings from properties like entropy vs. length.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Private Key Properties''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 005_Asymmetric Cryptography > 005_Key Establishment and Management
  > Key Pair Types and Properties > Private Key Properties). Use the following to generate 25-30 high-quality flashcards:


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s Taxonomy):** [Insert full list from above]. Ensure cards cover all levels proportionally
  (30% Remember/Understand, 40% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate/Create).


  **Active Learning Integration:** Tie explanations to activities: e.g., ''This tests analysis for the compromise discussion
  prompt.''


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full scaffolding from above]. Distribute cards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25%
  Layer 4.


  **Content Sources:** Asymmetric crypto basics (public/private roles in encryption/signing); Properties (secrecy, ≥2048-bit
  RSA/256-bit ECC length, full-entropy RNG, HSM storage, non-exportable); NIST SP 800-57 (key lifecycle), SP 800-130 (management
  frameworks); Examples: OpenSSL generation, RSA breach.


  **Flashcard Schema:** [Insert full schema from above]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects. No additional text.
  Ensure variety, pedagogical depth, and web-grounded accuracy (e.g., cite NIST). Make cards concise, active-recall focused,
  with distractors challenging common errors.'
