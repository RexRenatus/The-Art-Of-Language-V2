Because keys are highly sensitive, misconfigurations in cloud access policies, weak authentication, or vulnerabilities in the cloud environment can lead to compromise. Therefore, robust access controls are critical for securing key backups in the cloud.",

The second focuses on the encryption *of* the storage, which is usually strong, rather than the access *to* the storage. The third focuses on physical security, which is managed by the provider, but the primary user-controlled risk is logical access.",
        "analogy": "Storing key backups in the cloud is like storing valuables in a bank's safety deposit box. The main risk isn't the bank stealing your items (malicious provider), but someone gaining unauthorized access to your specific box through a security lapse or lost key (misconfiguration, weak access controls)."
