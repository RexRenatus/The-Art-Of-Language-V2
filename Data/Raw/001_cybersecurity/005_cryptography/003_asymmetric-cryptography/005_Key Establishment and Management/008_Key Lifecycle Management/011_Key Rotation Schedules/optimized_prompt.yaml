  Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 005_Asymmetric Cryptography > 005_Key Establishment and Management > 003_Key Lifecycle
  Management > Key Rotation Schedules). Use the provided research_context, learning_objectives, active_learning_components,
  scaffolding_layers, and formative_assessments to create 25 high-quality flashcards.


  Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom''s levels (remember/understand/apply/analyze/evaluate/create), active learning ties,
  scaffolding progression. Ensure completeness with full standards (NIST SP 800-57, PCI DSS, etc.) and concept map links.


  Follow flashcard_generation_schema exactly: JSON array of objects with ''front'', ''back'' (answer, explanation, bloom_level,
  source, active_link), ''type'' (Cloze/MCQ/QA). Distractors per protocol for MCQs. Cover all Bloom''s levels, layers, and
  objectives. Include formative MCQs with feedback. Make explanations actionable, referencing misconceptions and standards.
  Output only the JSON array.'
