      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Magnetic media like tapes have data remanence, meaning data can persist after logical deletion or overwriting, necessitating physical destruction. RAM is volatile; losing power typically erases it, and zeroization provides a more secure erasure method. Therefore, the destruction methods differ based on the media's properties.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Encryption and deletion are not primary destruction methods for these media. While overwriting can work for RAM, zeroization is preferred for security. Not all media require physical destruction.",
        "analogy": "Destroying data on a magnetic tape is like trying to erase writing from a stone tablet – it's hard to get rid of completely. Destroying data in RAM is like erasing a message on a whiteboard – a quick wipe usually suffices."
