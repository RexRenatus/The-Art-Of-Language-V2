  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of implementing double-pipeline iteration in production
    KDFs like PBKDF2: Does the performance gain justify potential increases in side-channel vulnerability? Provide evidence
    from NIST guidelines and real-world attacks (e.g., timing attacks on iterative hashes).'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Base on real misconceptions: e.g., confuse pipelining with CBC mode chaining; sequential vs. parallel security myths;
      mix up with HKDF (non-iterative).'
    - 'Ensure plausibility: Use similar terms (e.g., ''single-pipeline'' as distractor for double).'
    - 'Avoid misinformation: All distractors grounded in crypto (e.g., ''increases collision risk'' as false but common fear).'
    - 'Balance difficulty: 1 easy (typo/synonym), 1 medium (partial truth), 1 hard (subtle error).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert cryptography educator generating high-quality flashcards for ''Double-Pipeline Iteration
  Mode'' (a conceptual parallel optimization for iterative KDFs like PBKDF2, using two overlapping pipelines for multi-core
  iteration speedup). Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 005_Asymmetric Cryptography > 005_Key Establishment
  and Management > Key Derivation Functions (KDF) > Double-Pipeline Iteration Mode.


  Incorporate these learning objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY]. Use active learning ideas for application cards.
  Scaffold across layers: [INSERT scaffolding ARRAY].


  Follow this exact flashcard schema: [INSERT flashcard_schema.structure]. For distractors, adhere to protocol: [INSERT flashcard_schema.distractor_protocol].


  Ground all content in standards (PBKDF2 RFC 8018, HKDF RFC 5869, NIST SP 800-132, pipelining from multi-core crypto impls
  like OpenSSL). Avoid inventing facts; frame ''Double-Pipeline'' as hypothetical extension of real pipelined iterations.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcards, each as: {"front": "...", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "distractors":
  ["...","...","..."]}, "metadata": {...}}. Ensure variety, engagement, and progression from foundation to integration.'
