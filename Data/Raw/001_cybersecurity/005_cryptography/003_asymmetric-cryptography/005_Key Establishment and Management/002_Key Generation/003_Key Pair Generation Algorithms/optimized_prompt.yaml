active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: 'In pairs, simulate RSA key generation using small primes (e.g., p=61, q=53): compute modulus n, public exponent
    e=65537, private exponent d; explain steps to your partner and verify with modular arithmetic.'
  problem_solving: Design a secure key pair generation process for a blockchain wallet application. Address entropy sources
    (/dev/random or hardware RNG), algorithm selection (ECC for efficiency), parameters per NIST SP 800-56A, and integration
    into the key lifecycle (generation to destruction per NIST SP 800-57).
