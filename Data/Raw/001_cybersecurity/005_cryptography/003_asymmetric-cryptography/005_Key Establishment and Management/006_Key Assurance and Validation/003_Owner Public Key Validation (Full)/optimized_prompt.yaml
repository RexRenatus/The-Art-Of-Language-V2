active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between full owner public key validation (including CRL/OCSP checks and path validation)
    and performance in high-traffic systems like TLS handshakes. What risks are acceptable, and why? Support arguments with
    references to NIST SP 800-57 or RFC 5280.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''CRL checks expiration
    dates'' instead of revocation); 2) Partial truths (e.g., ''Verify only root CA signature''); 3) Confusions with related
    concepts (e.g., mix OCSP with CRL); 4) Edge cases from standards (e.g., ignore pathLenConstraint). Ensure distractors
    teach by debunking.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Cryptography (Domain: 001_Cryptography,
  Subdomain: 005_Asymmetric Cryptography). Topic: Owner Public Key Validation (Full) in Key Assurance and Validation (Entry:

  Prior Knowledge: Builds on asymmetric cryptography (key pairs, digital signatures).


  Incorporate these exactly:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste array above]

  - Active Learning: [discussion_prompt, peer_teaching_activity, problem_solving_exercise from above]

  - Scaffolding: [layer1_foundation to layer4_integration from above]

  - Research Context: Owner Public Key Validation verifies authenticity/integrity of public keys via PKI; core: public/private
  keys, signatures, CA, certs, CRLs; standards: RFC 5280 (full cert path validation incl. signature/period/revocation/path
  checks), NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 Rev4 (key mgmt lifecycle), NIST SP 800-89 (validation methods).


  Generate 40 high-quality flashcards per the Flashcard Schema [paste schema above]. Optimize for Anki import: Output as JSON
  array of objects, each with ''type'', ''front'', ''back'' (nested object). Ensure progression: 10 cards Layer1 (Remember),
  10 Layer2 (Understand), 10 Layer3 (Apply/Analyze), 10 Layer4 (Evaluate/Create). Vary difficulty; include active learning
  hooks (e.g., ''Relate to TLS debate''). Use precise terminology; no fluff.'
