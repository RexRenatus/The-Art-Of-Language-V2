active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the advantages and limitations of TPM 2.0 hierarchies (Platform, Storage, Endorsement, Null) in
    preventing supply chain attacks. Provide examples where compromising one hierarchy (e.g., firmware tampering in Platform
    Hierarchy) impacts others, and discuss mitigations like measured boot.
  peer_teaching: 'Pair students: One student explains PCRs, sealing, and attestation keys (EK/AK) to their partner using hand-drawn
    diagrams; the partner teaches back using a non-example (e.g., software-only cryptography without hardware root of trust).
    Switch roles to cover key hierarchies and their isolation.'
  problem_solving: In a scenario where a remote verifier must attest a cloud server's boot integrity, design a PCR measurement
    strategy (e.g., extend hashes for firmware, bootloader, OS), select appropriate keys (EK for identity, AK for attestation),
    simulate sealing data for secure boot, and include mitigations for rollback attacks. Present as a step-by-step flowchart.

    vs. ''store hashes''; for hierarchies: confuse PP with SP roles; for keys: ''EK is user-generated'' vs. ''factory-burned'').
    Ensure 1-2 per card are ''near-miss'' (e.g., valid TPM 1.2 concept), others superficially wrong. No hints in distractors.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in TPM 2.0 Architecture (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 005_Asymmetric Cryptography > 010_Cryptographic Hardware and Module Security
  > Trusted Platform Module (TPM) > TPM 2.0 Architecture). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives, active learning,
  and 4-layer scaffolding provided below. Prioritize voter consensus (67.1% approval) on completeness (TPM Library standards),
  clarity (fixed hierarchy), and pedagogy (link to asymmetric crypto/hashing priors).


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the ''learning_objectives'' array here verbatim].


  **Active Learning Context:** Use these for higher Bloom''s cards (e.g., inspire Evaluate/Create Qs from discussion/peer/problem-solving).
  [Insert ''active_learning'' object here as descriptive text].


  **Scaffolding Content:** Generate cards exclusively from these layers, proportionally (Layer1:20%, Layer2:25%, Layer3:30%,
  Layer4:25%). [Insert full ''scaffolding'' object here verbatim].


  **Flashcard Generation Rules:** Follow exact ''flashcard_schema'' (40-60 cards, types, distractors, explanations, JSON output
  grouped by layer). Ensure web-grounded accuracy (TCG specs, core concepts like PCR chaining, EK/AK). Cards must scaffold
  progressively: simple recall in Layer1 to integrative scenarios in Layer4. Vary phrasing for active recall. No external
  content.


  Output ONLY the JSON array as specified in schema.'
