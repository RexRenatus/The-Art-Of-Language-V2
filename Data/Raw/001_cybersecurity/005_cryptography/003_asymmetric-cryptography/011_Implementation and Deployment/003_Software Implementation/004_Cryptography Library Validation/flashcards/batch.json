      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Cryptographic agility allows systems to adapt to new cryptographic threats and standards without requiring a complete redesign. This proactive approach is essential because algorithms can become weak over time due to cryptanalytic advances or increased computing power, necessitating timely transitions.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The first distractor focuses narrowly on immediate compliance, not long-term adaptability. The second incorrectly suggests agility simplifies by reducing options. The third promotes proprietary solutions, contrary to the spirit of standardized agility.",
        "analogy": "Designing for crypto agility is like building a house with easily replaceable windows; when newer, more energy-efficient models become available, you can swap them out without rebuilding the entire house."
