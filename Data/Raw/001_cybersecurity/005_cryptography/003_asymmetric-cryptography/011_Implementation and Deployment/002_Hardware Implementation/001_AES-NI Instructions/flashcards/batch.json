However, the question asks what is NOT *directly* accelerated by the *core* instructions for *rounds*. Modes requiring significant additional logic beyond the basic AES round function (like CTR's counter increment or CBC's XORing) are less directly accelerated by the *core* AES-NI instructions themselves, though the underlying AES operations are. The provided answer is a generalization for modes that add significant complexity beyond the basic AES round.",
