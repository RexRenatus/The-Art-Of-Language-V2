active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare the tamper detection requirements across FIPS 140-3 security levels (e.g., Level 2 vs. Level
    4). In a debate, argue for or against implementing Level 4 for a national ID system smart card, considering cost, effectiveness,
    and real-world attack vectors like drilling, laser probing, or side-channel attacks. Address misconceptions that higher
    levels are always better.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Plausible but incorrect: Based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse Level 2 detection with Level 4; tamper-proof
      vs. detect).'
    - 'From research: Use real techniques/levels but mismatch (e.g., ''epoxy potting'' as response instead of detection).'
    - 'Variety: 1 near-miss (similar level), 1 opposite/extreme, 1 irrelevant.'
    - 'Balance: Cover all scaffolding layers/Bloom''s levels across deck.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Hardware Tamper Detection
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 009_PKI > 007_PKI Security Controls > 004_Physical Security Controls
  > Hardware Tamper Detection). Use the provided research context (FIPS 140-3 Levels 1-4, ISO/IEC 19790:2012 security levels
  A-D, techniques: active/passive sensors, seals, epoxy, zeroization; attacks: drilling/laser/cold boot/side-channel; examples:
  HSMs/TPMs), voter suggestions, and this exact schema to generate flashcards.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM JSON]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM JSON] (reference in explanations).

  - Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL LAYERS FROM JSON] (tag each card).


  Generate 40-50 MCQ flashcards following the Flashcard Schema exactly. Ensure progression: 10 cards per scaffolding layer,
  balanced Bloom''s. Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''options'': {''A'': ''...'', ''B'': ''...'',
  ...}, ''back'': {''correct_answer'': ''...'', ''distractors'': {''A'': ''...'', ...}, ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'':
  ''...'', ''source_reference'': ''...''}}, ...].


  Make questions active/recall-focused, distractors misconception-based. Ensure university-level rigor, FIPS/ISO accuracy,
  PKI integration.'
