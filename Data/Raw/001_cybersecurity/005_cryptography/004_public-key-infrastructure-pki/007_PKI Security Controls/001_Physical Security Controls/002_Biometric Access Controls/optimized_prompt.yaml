active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the privacy risks of storing biometric templates for PKI hardware access
    (e.g., CA rooms) versus traditional keys, and propose NIST-aligned mitigation strategies like tokenization or zero-knowledge
    proofs. Support arguments with references to SP 800-63B.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in PKI and physical security
  controls. Topic: Biometric Access Controls (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 009_Public Key Infrastructure
  (PKI) > 007_PKI Security Controls > 004_Physical Security Controls > Biometric Access Controls). Use the provided learning
  objectives, active learning ideas, scaffolding layers, and flashcard schema to generate 50-75 high-quality flashcards.


  Incorporate: NIST SP 800-63B details (AAL1: low assurance, no biometrics needed; AAL2: MFA including biometrics as ''something
  you are''; AAL3: phishing-resistant with hardware); vulnerabilities (spoofing, FAR/FRR); best practices (liveness detection,
  template protection); big picture (defense-in-depth for PKI CAs/HSMs, CIA triad); prior links (RBAC/ABAC).
