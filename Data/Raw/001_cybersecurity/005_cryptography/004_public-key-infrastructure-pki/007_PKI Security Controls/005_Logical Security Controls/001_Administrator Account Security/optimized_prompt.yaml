active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a PKI environment, how does the principle of least privilege conflict with the need for rapid administrative
    response during a cyber incident? Debate using NIST SP 800-63-4 guidelines (reflecting updated best practices in digital
    identity) and real-world examples like the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack where admin credentials were key. Consider
    trade-offs with 'just-in-time' access and PKI-specific controls like certificate revocation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    for admins''), 2) Related but incorrect concept (e.g., ''Symmetric keys for admin auth'' instead of PKI certs), 3) Extreme/overkill
    option (e.g., ''Revoke all certs immediately without auditing''). Ensure distractors test subtle PKI/IAM distinctions.'
