  discussion_prompt: In a world racing towards quantum supremacy, debate the top three risks of skipping post-migration validation
    in PKI transitions to PQC (e.g., latent vulnerabilities, interoperability failures) and propose countermeasures—team up
    to defend opposing views on whether 'algorithm swap = done' suffices.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, take turns explaining NIST CSF validation steps (e.g., key validation, CRL checks per RFC 5280,
    TLS 1.3 protocol testing per RFC 8446); the listener quizzes the teacher with follow-up questions and provides feedback
    on accuracy and completeness.
  problem_solving: Given a real-world scenario (e.g., an enterprise migrating PKI to NIST PQC algorithms like CRYSTALS-Kyber),
    design and peer-review a validation checklist including functional tests (interoperability), security tests (fuzzing,
    side-channel analysis), and performance benchmarks; iterate based on group feedback.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in PKI and Post-Quantum Cryptography
  (PQC). Generate 20-30 high-quality flashcards on ''Post-Migration Validation'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography
  > 009_Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) > 010_PKI Implementation and Migration > PKI Migration Strategies > Post-Migration
  Validation).


  Incorporate this research context: Post-migration validation verifies PKI security after transitioning to PQC (quantum-resistant
  algos like CRYSTALS-Kyber). Key RFCs: RFC 5280 (X.509 PKI Cert/CRL Profile for validation), RFC 8446 (TLS 1.3 crypto updates).
  Frameworks: NIST CSF (Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover), ISO 27001 (crypto controls). Methods: Inventory, key validation,
  protocol testing, fuzzing. Sources: NIST PQC Migration (https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography), Cybersecurity
  Dive articles on PQC transitions.
