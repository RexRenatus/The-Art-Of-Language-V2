active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a PKI deployment for a large enterprise, discuss the potential cybersecurity risks of failing performance
    testing on OCSP responders during peak revocation checks. What metrics would you prioritize and why?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1 generic software testing misconception (e.g., confuses load with functional
      testing), 1 PKI-specific error (e.g., ignores HSM bottlenecks), 1 overgeneralization (e.g., assumes all PKI scales linearly).'
    - Ensure distractors are 70-80% similar to correct answer to challenge understanding.
    - 'Base on voter priorities: accuracy (PKI context), common pitfalls like overlooking OCSP under load.'

  - Active Learning: [insert active_learning object here]

  - Scaffolding: [insert scaffolding array here]

  - Concept Map: Central ''PKI Performance Testing'' branches to CA throughput, OCSP/CRL load, HSM scaling; links to migration
  (010).


  Tailor ALL content to PKI: e.g., load testing CA cert issuance (1000s concurrent), OCSP responders under revocation spikes,
  CRL distribution scalability, HSM key gen stress. Use tools like JMeter/LoadRunner. Sources: Browserstack, Apriorit, Aptori
  (adapt to PKI).
