  CRITICAL: Address accuracy concerns—define as strategies for deploying CAs/PKI components across geographies to optimize
  latency, high availability, comply with regulations (GDPR, data sovereignty), and ensure redundancy. Distinguish from general
  business strategies; base on PKI standards (e.g., RFC 5280, CA/B Forum).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use for scenario-based cards (e.g., discussion trade-offs, bank design exercise).

  - Scaffolding Layers: Distribute cards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4.

  - Generate 50 flashcards total, balanced by Bloom''s (REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND:20%, APPLY/ANALYZE:40%, EVALUATE/CREATE:40%).


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly:

  - Output as JSON array of objects: [{''type'': ''MCQ/TF/Short Answer'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffold_layer'': 1-4,
  ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''hints'': [''...'', ''...'']}, ''distractors'':
  [''opt1'', ''opt2'', ''opt3''] (for MCQ)}]

  - Distractors: 3 plausible per MCQ, per protocol.

  - Explanations: Tie to objectives, accuracy, real-world (e.g., global banks).


  Ensure active recall: Questions test application over rote. No spoilers in fronts.'
