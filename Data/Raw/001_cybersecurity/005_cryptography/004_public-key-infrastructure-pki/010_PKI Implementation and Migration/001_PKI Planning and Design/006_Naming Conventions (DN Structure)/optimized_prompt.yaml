  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives** (span Bloom''s): [insert full list above].

  - **Big Picture**: DN conventions ensure uniqueness, scalability, interoperability in PKI, preventing mis-issuance and aiding
  migration. Link to X.509 cert Subjects.

  - **Research Context**: DN = unique hierarchical identifier (RDN sequence) in DIT/X.500/LDAP. Attributes: CN, OU, O, C,
  ST, L, UID. NIST SP 800-57 (Key Mgmt): Use stable, unique names; prioritize scalability. Best practices: Uniqueness per
  parent, short/human-readable balance, no special chars.

  - **Scaffolding Layers**: [insert full descriptions above]. Build cards progressively.

  - **Active Learning Integration**: Include 5-10 cards prompting discussion/peer teach/problem-solving (e.g., ''Debate trade-offs...''
  or ''Construct DN for scenario...'').


  **Output 50 flashcards strictly following this schema**:

  For each:

  **Card #X (Layer Y | Bloom''s: LEVEL)**

  **Front:** [Question]

  **Back:**

  - **Answer:** [ ]

  - **Explanation:** [with NIST ref, misconception fix]
