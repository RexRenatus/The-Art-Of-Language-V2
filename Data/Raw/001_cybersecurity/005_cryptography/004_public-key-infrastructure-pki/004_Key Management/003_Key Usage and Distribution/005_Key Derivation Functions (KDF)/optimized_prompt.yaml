active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs between single-step expansion KDFs (e.g., simple hash-based) and multi-step methods
    like extraction-then-expansion in NIST SP 800-56C. In what scenarios might one fail where the other succeeds, considering
    attacker models such as known shared secret length or low-entropy inputs? Debate in groups and cite standards like NIST
    SP 800-108 or HKDF.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    distractors are realistic from NIST pitfalls or voter-noted misconceptions.'

  - TLS/SSH KDFs. Examples: HKDF (RFC 5869, https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5869), PBKDF2. Keywords: shared secret,
  domain separation, keying material.
