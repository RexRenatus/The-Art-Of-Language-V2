active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a Root CA Key Generation Ceremony, debate the trade-offs between using an HSM versus software-based
    key generation, referencing NIST SP 800-57 and real-world incidents like the DigiNotar compromise. Which security controls
    (e.g., air-gapping, multi-party approval, tamper-evident logs) are non-negotiable, and why? Address common misconceptions
    about software security sufficiency.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Use this optimized learning content to generate 25 high-quality flashcards:


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives above]


  **Active Learning Integration:** Draw from discussion (HSM trade-offs), peer teaching (roles), problem-solving (flawed scenarios)
  for scenario-based cards.


  **Scaffolding Layers:** Generate 6-7 cards per layer using exact content: [Insert full scaffolding array above].


  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly follow: Basic (Q/A + Expl + Bloom + Src), Cloze (gapped text), MCQ (1 correct + 3 distractors
  per protocol). Balance types. Tag each: #LayerX #BloomsLevel #Source.


  **Best Practices:** Spaced repetition friendly (active recall, no hints). Ground in sources (NIST SP 800-57/133, WebTrust).
  Avoid fluff; precise, testable. Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''tags'':
  ''...''}].


  Big Picture: Emphasize trust foundation, risks (e.g., DigiNotar). Ensure cards scaffold from remember to create.'
