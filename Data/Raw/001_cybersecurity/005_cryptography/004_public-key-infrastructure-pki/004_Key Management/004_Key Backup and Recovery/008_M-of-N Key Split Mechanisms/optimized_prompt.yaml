active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the optimal M-of-N configuration (e.g., 2-of-3 vs. 3-of-5) for a financial
    institution's PKI key recovery process. Consider trade-offs in security, accessibility, and compliance with NIST SP 800-57.
    Support arguments with real-world examples like HSM-based recoveries and address common misconceptions, such as partial
    shares revealing key information.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Cryptography and PKI. Generate
  30 high-quality MCQ flashcards on ''M-of-N Key Split Mechanisms'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 009_Public
  Key Infrastructure (PKI) > 006_Key Management > Key 010_Backup and 005_Recovery > M-of-N Key Split Mechanisms). Use this
  research context: M-of-N divides secret into N shares, any M reconstructs (e.g., Shamir''s SSS via polynomial interpolation);
  enhances PKI resilience per NIST SP 800-57 (key mgmt) and NISTIR 8214A (threshold criteria). Examples: 2-of-3 HSMs. Misconceptions:
  <M shares leak info.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full list above]

  - Scaffolding: Distribute 7-8 cards per layer [paste scaffolding summaries].

  - Active Learning: Hook each card back to one activity.

  - Prior/Big Picture: Resilient key backup; links to secret sharing basics.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: Output ONLY a JSON array of 30 objects, each with ''front'' (question + 4 options A-D,
  A correct), ''back'' (correct_answer, explanation w/ source/Bloom/layer, active_learning_hook, scaffolding_layer). Ensure
  distractors per protocol. Cards must be university-level, active recall-focused, no hints in questions.'
