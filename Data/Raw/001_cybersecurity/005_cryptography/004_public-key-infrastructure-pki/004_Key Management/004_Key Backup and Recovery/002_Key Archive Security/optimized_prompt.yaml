active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the balance between confidentiality, integrity, and availability in key archiving—how do NIST
    SP 800-57 recommendations address trade-offs in real-world scenarios like disaster recovery? Consider misconceptions such
    as treating key archives as regular file backups.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Store keys in plaintext backups' as
      distractor for archiving procedure).
    - 'Distractors must be: 1) Partial truths (e.g., confuses confidentiality with availability), 2) Over-generalizations
      (e.g., ''Use any HSM without access controls''), 3) Real-world pitfalls (e.g., ''Skip encryption for speed'').'
    - Ensure distractors align with research context and voter-noted misconceptions like treating archives as regular backups.
    - 'Balance difficulty: 1 easy (obvious wrong), 1 medium (confusing term swap), 1 hard (subtle trade-off error).'
    count_per_deck: '20-30 flashcards total: 50% MCQ, 30% cloze, 20% short answer. Cover all Bloom''s levels and scaffolding

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list from above]

  - Active Learning: Use as inspiration for explanatory notes (e.g., tie to discussion prompts).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers (tag each with Layer:X).

  - Prior Knowledge: Assume basics from Cryptography/Key Management; flashcards build on this.

  - Big Picture/Context: Key archiving fits key lifecycle for PKI resilience; reference NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 Rev. 5 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r5.pdf)
  and Part 2 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-57pt2r2).

  - Concept Map: Central ''Key Archive Security'' → CIA → NIST → PKI/Key Mgmt.
