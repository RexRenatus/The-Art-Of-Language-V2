      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Archiving legacy keys implies they are still needed for specific, authorized purposes (e.g., decrypting historical data) and are stored securely. Secure destruction, conversely, is the irreversible process of eliminating keys when they are no longer needed, to prevent future compromise.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors confuse the purpose (active vs. expired), methods (encryption vs. shredding), or duration (temporary vs. permanent) of archiving and destruction. The core difference lies in recoverability and ongoing need.",
        "analogy": "Archiving is like putting important documents in a safe deposit box for safekeeping. Secure destruction is like shredding sensitive documents you no longer need, ensuring they can never be pieced back together."
