active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between RSA (e.g., 2048-bit) and ECC (e.g., P-256 curve)
    for key pair generation in resource-constrained IoT devices. Reference NIST guidelines and justify your preferred algorithm
    based on security, speed, and future-proofing against quantum threats.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Cryptography and PKI. Generate\
  \ 30 high-quality flashcards on 'Key Pair Generation Algorithms' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 009_Public\
  \ Key Infrastructure (PKI) > 006_Key Management > Key Generation > Key Pair Generation Algorithms).\n\nIncorporate these\
  \ pedagogical elements:\n- Bloom's Taxonomy: Balance 20% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 30% APPLY/ANALYZE, 50% EVALUATE/CREATE.\n\
  - Scaffolding: Distribute across 4 layers – Foundation (Layer 1), Components (Layer 2), Implementation (Layer 3), Integration\
  \ (Layer 4).\n- Active Learning Tie-ins: Reference discussion (e.g., RSA vs ECC), peer teaching (algorithm steps), problem-solving\
  \ (scenarios).\n- Content Completeness: Cover RSA, DSA, ECDSA, Ed25519; NIST SP 800-133/90A/56B; entropy, Miller-Rabin,\
  \ curves (P-256), pitfalls, quantum threats, PKI links (HTTPS/VPNs).\n\nUse this exact schema for each flashcard in a JSON\
  \ array:\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"front\": \"Question here\",\n    \"back\": {\n      \"answer\": \"Correct answer\"\
