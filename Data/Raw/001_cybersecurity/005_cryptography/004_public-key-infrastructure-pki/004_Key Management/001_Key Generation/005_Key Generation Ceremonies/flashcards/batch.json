This works by minimizing exposure points and increasing oversight, directly addressing the threat of malicious actors gaining access to the keys during their creation.",

Generating keys on standard systems is like trying to print money at home with a regular printer – much higher risk of flaws and theft."

This contrasts with the essential elements like physical security, trusted participants, and a robust RNG, which are foundational to establishing the key's integrity from the outset.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Physical security, multiple trusted participants, and a CSPRNG are all critical elements of a key generation ceremony. Automated key recovery is a separate key management function that occurs after generation.",
