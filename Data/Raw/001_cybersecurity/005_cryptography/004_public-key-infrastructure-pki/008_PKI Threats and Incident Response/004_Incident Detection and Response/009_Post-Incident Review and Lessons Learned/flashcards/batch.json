        "core_logic": "HSM audit logs are critical because they provide an immutable record of sensitive operations, including private key usage, which is essential for detecting compromise. This works by logging every cryptographic operation performed by the HSM, allowing security teams to identify suspicious or unauthorized key access.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors suggest reviewing logs for information unrelated to security events, such as supported algorithms, certificate counts, or network bandwidth, rather than the primary purpose of monitoring key access and usage.",
        "analogy": "HSM audit logs are like security camera footage of a vault. You review it to see who accessed the vault and when, not to check the vault's temperature or the color of the walls."
