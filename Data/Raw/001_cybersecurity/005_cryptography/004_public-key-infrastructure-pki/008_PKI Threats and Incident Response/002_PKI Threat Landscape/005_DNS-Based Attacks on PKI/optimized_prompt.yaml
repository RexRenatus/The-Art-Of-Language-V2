active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate how DNS cache poisoning can bypass PKI certificate validation in HTTPS connections. Debate whether
    DNSSEC alone is sufficient mitigation or if additional layers like Certificate Transparency (CT), CAA records, or DANE
    are necessary. Support arguments with real-world examples like NXNSAttack.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    prevents cache poisoning'' vs. reality), (b) similar but incorrect concepts (e.g., ''IP spoofing'' instead of ''DNS spoofing''),
    (c) partial truths (e.g., ''Mitigated only by firewalls''), (d) unrelated distractors (e.g., ''SQL injection''). Ensure
    distractors are plausible and derived from research context or voter suggestions.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in PKI threats. Generate high-quality,
  spaced-repetition optimized flashcards for the topic ''DNS-Based Attacks on PKI'' (Category: Cybersecurity; Domain: 001_Cryptography;
  Subdomain: 009_Public Key Infrastructure (PKI); Entry: 008_PKI Threats & 002_Incident Response; Entry Subdomain: PKI Threat
  Landscape; Full Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 009_PKI > 008_PKI Threats & 002_Incident Response > PKI Threat
  Landscape > DNS-Based Attacks on PKI).


  Incorporate this completed research context (synthesized from web sources like Palo Alto Networks, StartupDefense):

  - DNS: Translates domains to IPs; vulnerable due to lack of initial security.

  - PKI: Manages certs/public keys via CAs for secure comms.

  - Vulnerabilities/Attacks: DNS spoofing (forges responses to redirect to rogue CAs/OCSP); cache poisoning (Kaminsky: injects
  false cache entries); NXNSAttack (DNSSEC NSEC exploit for false proofs, impacting PKI validation); PKI impacts: Bypass AIA
  chasing, DV issuance hijacks, cert pinning evasion.

  - Mitigations: DNSSEC, DANE, CAA, CT, HPKP.
