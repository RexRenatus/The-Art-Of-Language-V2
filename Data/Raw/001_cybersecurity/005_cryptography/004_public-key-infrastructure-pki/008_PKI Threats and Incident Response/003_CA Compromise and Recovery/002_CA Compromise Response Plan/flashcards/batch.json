        "core_logic": "The distinction is critical because the *impact* differs significantly. A lost private key primarily affects the CA's ability to operate normally (no new valid certs). A misused key means the attacker is actively impersonating the CA, issuing malicious certificates that appear valid, posing an immediate threat to trust.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Revocation is needed in both cases, but the *reason* and *scope* differ. Misuse directly attacks integrity and impersonation (confidentiality of identity), while loss primarily impacts CA operations. Shutting down the CA is a drastic measure not always required for a lost key.",
