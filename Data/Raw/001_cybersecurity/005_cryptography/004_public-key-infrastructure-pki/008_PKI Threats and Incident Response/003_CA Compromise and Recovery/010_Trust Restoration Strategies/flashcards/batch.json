The second incorrectly assumes the compromise is due to algorithm weakness rather than a breach of the CA's operational security.

        "core_logic": "Applying the principle of least privilege to CA roles is fundamental for trust restoration because it minimizes the attack surface for insider threats or compromised credentials. By ensuring that each CA operator or system only has the permissions strictly required for their function, the potential impact of a security incident is contained, preventing a single compromised account from leading to a full CA compromise.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Granting full administrative access to all personnel is a major security risk. Least privilege applies to all roles, not just the Root CA administrator. External controls are important, but internal controls like least privilege are crucial for mitigating insider threats.",
        "analogy": "Least privilege for CA roles is like giving different employees keys only to the specific rooms they need to access for their job. The janitor gets keys to supply closets, the manager gets keys to offices, but neither gets keys to the vault, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive areas."

It provides a structured, phased approach to manage the incident, ensuring that the CA's operations are secured, compromised elements are removed, trust is re-established through actions like revocation and re-issuance, and lessons are learned to prevent recurrence. This systematic approach is vital because a CA compromise undermines the entire trust infrastructure.",
