active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss how timestamping certificates enhance non-repudiation in digital signatures, even after certificate
    revocation. Share real-world examples like Adobe PDF timestamping for document integrity or software release proofs. Address
    common misconceptions, such as confusing time-stamp tokens with standard PKI certificates.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Use common misconceptions (e.g., 'Timestamp token is a full PKI certificate' vs. 'It binds hash to time via TSA sig').
    - 'Partial truths (e.g., correct standard but wrong detail: RFC 3161 uses MD5 – actually SHA family).'
    - Confuse related concepts (e.g., TSA vs. CA; non-repudiation vs. integrity only).
    - Outdated/wrong standards (e.g., RFC 3628 as primary vs. support).
    - Real-world mix-ups (e.g., blockchain as TSA replacement – distractor for integration).
