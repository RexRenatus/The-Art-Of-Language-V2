  Points (CDP).


  **Core Content (Synthesized from RFC 5280 and Voter Consensus):**

  - **Foundation:** Prerequisites: X.509 v3 certs, PKI (CAs issue/revoke certs), revocation needed for compromised keys pre-expiry.
  CDP (OID 2.5.29.31): Extension with URIs (HTTP/LDAP) to fetch CRLs (signed lists of revoked serials, with thisUpdate/nextUpdate/reasons).

  - **Structure:** Non-critical by default; DistributionPoint: fullName (URIs), reasons (bitstring: unused, keyCompromise,...),
  cRLIssuer.

  - **Revocation Check (Complete Process):** 1. Extract CDP from cert. 2. Select matching DP (by reasons/issuer). 3. Fetch
  CRL. 4. Verify CRL sig/validity period. 5. Check serial not revoked. Supports delta CRLs.

  - **Implementation:** OpenSSL: ''openssl x509 -text -in cert.pem'' shows CDP; fetch/verify CRL.

  - **Integration:** Vs OCSP (pull vs push, CRL scalable but delayed); path validation series of checks.

  - **Big Picture:** Ensures PKI trust by blocking revoked certs in lifecycle.

  - **Sources:** RFC 5280 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280), OpenSSL docs.


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s):** [Insert the learning_objectives array here verbatim].

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the scaffolding_layers array here verbatim].

  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Include cards prompting OpenSSL exercises, comparisons, policy design.


  **Voter Priorities Integrated:** Full revocation process; hands-on OpenSSL; MCQs with distractors on misconceptions (CDP≠CRL,
  ≠OCSP); prior knowledge links.


  **Output Exactly 40 Flashcards in JSON Array:** Each follows [flashcard_generation_schema structure verbatim]. Balance types/levels.
  Use active recall (no hints on front). Explanations reference layers/objectives. Distractors per protocol. Ensure completeness,
  pedagogy, no truncation.'
