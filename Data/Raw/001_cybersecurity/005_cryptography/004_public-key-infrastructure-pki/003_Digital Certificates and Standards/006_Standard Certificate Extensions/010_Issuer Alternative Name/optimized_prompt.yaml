active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student uses 'openssl x509 -text' on a sample certificate to demonstrate IAN, explains its
    structure and role; the partner teaches it back and quizzes on key differences from SAN.
  problem_solving: Given a TLS handshake failure log showing 'issuer name mismatch,' diagnose if IAN is the cause, propose
    a certificate redesign using OpenSSL config, and evaluate fixes against RFC 5280.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate plausible distractors from misconceptions: e.g., confuse OID with SAN (2.5.29.17), claim
    IAN is mandatory/critical, mix with subject fields, wrong RFC section (e.g., 4.2.1.6), attribute to wrong standard (e.g.,
    RFC 9525 instead of 5280), or real-world errors like ''IAN used for subject verification''. Base on voter-noted errors
    and PKI common pitfalls.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in PKI. Generate high-quality,
  spaced-repetition optimized flashcards for ''Issuer Alternative Name'' using the provided schema. Ensure 100% accuracy:
  IAN is optional extension OID 2.5.29.18 (RFC 5280 §4.2.1.7), for alternative issuer names via GeneralNames; correct any
  misconceptions (e.g., it is explicitly defined there).


  Context: Topic hierarchy - Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 009_PKI > 003_Digital Certificates > Standard Extensions >
  Issuer Alternative Name. Voter consensus: 87.1% approval, prioritize accuracy/pedagogy.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: Cover all 6 exactly, with cards tagged to Bloom''s levels.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers (5-8 cards/layer).

  - Active learning: Weave in prompts (e.g., ''How would you debate this in discussion?'', OpenSSL commands for peer teaching/problem-solving).

  - Prior knowledge: Link to SAN, issuer DN, cert basics.


  Output ONLY the JSON array of flashcards per the exact schema. Balance types/objectives/layers. Make fronts active/challenging
  (e.g., ''Inspect this OpenSSL output: What does IAN indicate?''). Explanations pedagogical, with distractors plausible.
  Generate 25 cards total.'
