active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''AKI is optional in modern PKI because SKI alone suffices
    for chain validation.'' Use RFC 5280 and key rollover examples to support arguments, evaluating real-world security impacts.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Plausible error (e.g., wrong hash algo like MD5 vs SHA-1); 3) Rollover oversight (e.g., ''AKI unchanged during key
    change''). Ensure plausible for Bloom''s level; avoid obvious wrongs.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, following university pedagogy

  Use this optimized content:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert array above]

  - Active Learning: [insert object above]

  - Scaffolding: [insert array above, with full voter consensus completeness on key rollover, misconceptions, prior knowledge,
  RFC 5280, best practices].


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards in JSON array format. Cover all objectives (prioritize higher Bloom''s), layers evenly,
  integrate active learning scenarios. Strictly follow flashcard_schema:

  { [insert schema above] }


  Ensure completeness: AKI handles CA key rollover by hashing new issuer key in end-entity AKI (matches new CA cert SKI);
  old certs retain old AKI for distinction. Voter-approved: 100% consensus on pedagogy/scaffolding. Output ONLY valid JSON
  array of objects, no extra text.'
