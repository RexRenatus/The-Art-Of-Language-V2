active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a PKI deployment for secure email (S/MIME), debate the risks of omitting the decipherOnly bit when
    keyAgreement is enabled. Consider attacker scenarios where a certificate could be misused for key wrapping instead of
    only unwrapping.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Related bits: Swap with keyEncipherment (Bit 2) or keyAgreement (Bit 4).'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert PKI flashcard generator specializing in X.509 standards. Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards
  for the topic ''Decipher Only Bit (Bit 8)'' in Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 009_Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) >

  CRITICAL: Ignore any random bit generation (RBG, NIST SP 800-90) content—focus EXCLUSIVELY on the ''decipherOnly'' bit (Bit
  8) in the keyUsage BIT STRING extension (RFC 5280 Section 4.2.1.3; ITU-T X.509 2019 Section 4.2.1.9). It asserts that, with
  keyAgreement (Bit 4), the key is for decryption/unwrapping ONLY (no encryption/wrapping). Related: RFC 3279 (CMS), NIST
  SP 800-57.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to discussion/peer teaching/problems (e.g., ''Apply to S/MIME scenario'').

  - Scaffolding: Distribute evenly across 4 layers [PASTE FULL LIST].

  - Bloom''s Coverage: 20% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate, 20% Create.


  Use Flashcard Schema [PASTE FULL SCHEMA]:

  - Varied types: 40% basic Q&A, 40% MCQ (strict distractor protocol), 20% scenario/create.

  - Ensure accuracy: Bit positions MSB=0 (digitalSignature=0 ... decipherOnly=8).

  - Examples/non-examples: openssl outputs, hex DER (e.g., 0x30 for keyAgreement+decipherOnly).

  - Misconceptions: Differentiate from encipherOnly, symmetric keys, keyEncipherment.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, no extra text: [{''id'':1, ''bloom_level'':''Remember'', ''scaffolding_layer'':1,
  ''type'':''Q&A'', ''front'':''...'', ''back'':{''answer'':''...'', ''explanation'':''...'', ''hints'':[''...''], ''references'':[''RFC
  5280'']}, ''related_activity'':''discussion_prompt''}]. Ensure comprehensive coverage of topic hierarchy and voter priorities
  (accuracy/completeness/pedagogy).'
