This transparency helps ensure that certificates appearing on CRLs are indeed validly revoked, as their issuance is publicly verifiable.",
        "distractor_analysis": "CT logs do not replace CRLs, are not used for direct CRL publication, and do not encrypt certificates; their role is in monitoring certificate issuance.",
        "analogy": "CT logs are like a public registry of all issued ID cards. If a fraudulent ID is issued, it's recorded publicly. This helps later when checking a 'revoked' list (CRL) to see if the ID was ever legitimately issued in the first place."
