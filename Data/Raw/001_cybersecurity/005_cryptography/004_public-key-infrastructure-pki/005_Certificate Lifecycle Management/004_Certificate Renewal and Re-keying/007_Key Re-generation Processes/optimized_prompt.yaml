  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]\n- Active Learning: Use concepts from discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving\
  \ for scenario cards.\n- Scaffolding: Layer content across Foundation (Layer1), Components (Layer2), Implementation (Layer3),\
  \ Integration (Layer4).\n- Prior Knowledge: Link to symmetric/asymmetric keys, PKI basics.\n- Key Steps: Detailed PKI re-gen\
  \ process (new key pair, CSR, issuance, update, revoke).\n- Standards: NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 (https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-57/part-1/rev-5/final)\
  \ - periodic rotation, lifecycle.\n- Big Picture: Reduces PKI risks, prevents breaches (RSA SecurID 2011).\n- Misconceptions:\
