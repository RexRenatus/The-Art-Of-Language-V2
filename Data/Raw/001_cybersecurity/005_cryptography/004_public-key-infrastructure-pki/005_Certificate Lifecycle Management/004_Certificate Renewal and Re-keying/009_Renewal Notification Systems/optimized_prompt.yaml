active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between automated renewal notifications (e.g., via ACME
    in Let's Encrypt) and manual monitoring in enterprise PKI setups. Consider factors like security risks, operational overhead,
    and compliance with NIST SP 800-57. Provide evidence from standards like RFC 8555 and real-world incidents of certificate
    expiry disruptions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol:
    rules: Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions (e.g., confusing renewal notifications
      with revocation lists; mixing ACME auto-renewal with manual alerts; overlooking standards like RFC 5280). Ensure distractors
      are realistic (e.g., 'Email only after expiry' vs. correct 'Proactive 30-day alert'), derived from voter-noted risks
      like service disruptions or incomplete research context.
    quality_check: Distractors must be 70% plausible to learners at foundational levels; avoid obvious errors.
