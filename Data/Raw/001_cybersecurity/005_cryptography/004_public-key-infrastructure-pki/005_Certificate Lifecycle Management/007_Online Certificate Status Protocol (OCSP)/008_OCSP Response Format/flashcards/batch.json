        "core_logic": "A missing or invalid signature on an OCSP response is a critical vulnerability because it allows attackers to forge responses, potentially leading clients to trust revoked certificates or distrust valid ones. This functions by undermining the integrity and authenticity checks that are fundamental to PKI trust.",
