active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare PKCS#10 with modern enrollment protocols like EST or ACME. Debate trade-offs in security (e.g.,
    proof-of-possession), simplicity, and interoperability for enterprise PKI deployments. Which is best for a high-security
    server certificate scenario and why?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Request Format (Category: Cybersecurity, Domain: 001_Cryptography, Subdomain: 009_Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), Entry:
  003_Certificate Lifecycle Management, Enrollment Protocols). Use RFC 2986 ASN.1: CertificationRequest ::= SEQUENCE { certificationRequestInfo

  { version INTEGER {v1(0)}, subject Name, subjectPKInfo SubjectPublicKeyInfo, attributes [0] Attributes OPTIONAL }.


  Incorporate these learning objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY]. Active learning: [INSERT active_learning SUMMARY].
  Scaffolding layers: [INSERT scaffolding ARRAY].


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following this schema exactly: [INSERT flashcard_schema FULLY]. Output as JSON array
  of objects, each with ''type'', ''front'', ''back'' (as object), ''tags'' (e.g., [''Remember'', ''Layer1'', ''PKI'']). Ensure
  university-level pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, explanations tie to Bloom''s levels/layers. Use voter
  consensus: completeness on components, OpenSSL examples, comparisons. No fluff; precise, error-free.'
