active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges of auditing PKI components like CA key ceremonies and CRL
    management in a hybrid cloud environment. How do GAO CPAG and NIST SP 800-53A address these, and what publication risks
    arise from public disclosure requirements?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
