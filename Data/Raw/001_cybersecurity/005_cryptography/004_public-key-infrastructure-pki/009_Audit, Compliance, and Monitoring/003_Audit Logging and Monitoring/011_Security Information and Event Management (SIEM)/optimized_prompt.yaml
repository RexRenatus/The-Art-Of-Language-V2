active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the role of SIEM in modern cybersecurity: ''Is SIEM sufficient as a standalone
    tool for threat detection, or must it always be integrated with tools like UEBA and SOAR? Support your position with real-world
    examples from breaches like SolarWinds or Log4j.'' Encourage critical thinking by requiring participants to reference
    specific SIEM processes (e.g., correlation vs. alerting).'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full array above]

  - Active Learning: [insert full object above]

  - Scaffolding: 4 layers [insert full object above], generating 10-12 flashcards per layer (total 40-50).

  - Voter Consensus: Complete ''How SIEM Works'' (Collection, Normalization, Correlation, Aggregation/Analysis, Alerting,
  Reporting/Visualization); emphasize pedagogy via Bloom''s; fix hierarchy.

  - Research Context: SIEM aggregates/analyzes logs for real-time threats; SIM (storage/reporting), SEM (monitoring/correlation);
  full workflow as in scaffolding.


  Generate flashcards following this exact schema: [insert full flashcard_schema above].

  Output ONLY as JSON: {''flashcards'': [array of objects, each {''front'': str, ''back'': str, ''type'': ''cloze|mcq|sa|scenario'',
  ''bloom_level'': str, ''scaffolding_layer'': int, ''explanation'': str, ''tags'': [str]} ] }. Ensure variety, high pedagogy
  (active recall, spaced repetition friendly), and no criminal/offensive content.'
