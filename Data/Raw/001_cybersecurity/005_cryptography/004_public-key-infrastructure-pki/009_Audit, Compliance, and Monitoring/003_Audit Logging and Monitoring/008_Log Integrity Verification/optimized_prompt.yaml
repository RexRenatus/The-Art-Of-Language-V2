active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs between using simple cryptographic hashes versus digital signatures for log integrity
    in resource-constrained environments like IoT devices. Which would you choose for a banking system and why? Consider ASD
    best practices for event logging and threat detection.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Backups ensure integrity' instead of cryptographic verification).
    - Mix correct primitives wrongly (e.g., 'Use MD5 for chains' vs. SHA-256).
    - Confuse standards (e.g., 'TCG for log storage' vs. integrity).
    - Resource trade-offs (e.g., 'Signatures for IoT' vs. hashes).
    - 'For MCQs: One partially correct, one opposite, one unrelated.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Topic: Log Integrity Verification (Hierarchy:

  Verification).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives: [insert full learning_objectives array here].

  - Active learning for deeper understanding: [insert active_learning object here].

  - Scaffolding: Generate flashcards progressively across 4 layers: [insert full scaffolding_layers here].


  Use this schema for each flashcard:

  Front: {{Question}}

  Back: {{Answer}}

  {{Explanation with research (NIST SP 800-92, ASD Essential Eight), prior links (hashing/PKI), example}}

  Bloom: {{level}}-Layer{{n}}

  Refs: {{sources}}


  For MCQs: Include 3 distractors per flashcard_protocol, plausible via misconceptions (e.g., backups=integrity).


  Output 50 flashcards in Anki import format (tab-separated: Front\tBack\tTags). Cover all layers/objectives evenly. Ensure
  active recall, no hints on front. Base on research: hash chains/Merkle trees/digital sigs/WORM, standards (NIST/ASD/TCG),
  scenarios (IoT/banking).'
