        "core_logic": "Accurate time synchronization via NTP is essential for logging because inconsistent timestamps across distributed systems prevent effective event correlation and timeline reconstruction, which are vital for incident response and security investigations.",

        "analogy": "Using NTP is like ensuring all clocks in a large building are set to the exact same time; this allows everyone to agree on when events happened, which is crucial for coordinating actions or investigating incidents."

        "core_logic": "Log retention policies are critical because regulations (like PCI-DSS, HIPAA) mandate specific retention periods to ensure that historical data is available for audits and investigations, thus balancing security requirements with practical storage and management constraints.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Immediate deletion or indefinite retention are both problematic. Retention is typically policy-driven and not solely dependent on incident occurrence.",
        "analogy": "Log retention is like keeping old bank statements; you need to hold onto them for a certain period (e.g., for tax purposes or audits) but not forever, as they take up space and can become unwieldy."
