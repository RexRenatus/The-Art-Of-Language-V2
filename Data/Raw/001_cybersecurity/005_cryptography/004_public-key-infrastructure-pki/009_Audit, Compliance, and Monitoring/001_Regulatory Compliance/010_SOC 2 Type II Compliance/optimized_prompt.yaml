active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of a cloud service provider managing PKI certificates, debate which Trust Services Criterion
    (Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, or Privacy) is the most challenging to achieve SOC 2 Type
    II compliance for, and why. Support with real-world examples (e.g., certificate revocation failures impacting Availability).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Content Context (Complete Research Summary):**

  SOC 2 Type II is an AICPA framework under SSAE No. 18 (2016 standard replacing SSAE 16; governs attestation via AT-C Sections
  105/205). Focuses on 5 Trust Services Criteria (TSC): Security (protect info/systems; CC1-CC9, e.g., PKI in CC6), Availability
  (operable as committed), Processing Integrity (complete/valid processing), Confidentiality (protect confidential info),
  Privacy (per privacy notice/GAPP). Type II tests operating effectiveness over 3-12 months vs. Type I (design only). Sources:
  AICPA.org (TS 202x updates), SSAE18.pdf, NordLayer.com, Vanta.com, Drata.com.
