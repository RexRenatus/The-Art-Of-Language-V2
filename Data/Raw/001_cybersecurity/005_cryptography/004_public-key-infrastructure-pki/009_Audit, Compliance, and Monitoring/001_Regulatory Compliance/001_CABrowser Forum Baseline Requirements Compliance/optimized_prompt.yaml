active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs between Domain Validation (DV), Organizational Validation (OV), and Extended
    Validation (EV) certificates in terms of security, cost, and user trust. Debate using real-world examples like the DigiNotar
    compromise due to non-compliance with BR identity verification requirements.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

      only), 1 related but incorrect term (e.g., ''OV'' instead of ''EV''), 1 exaggerated/understated fact (e.g., ''398 years''
      vs. ''398 days'' validity). Base on BR nuances, voter priorities, and research context to avoid random errors.'
    count: Ensure balance across Bloom's levels and scaffolding layers.

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste the full ''learning_objectives'' array here].

  - Active Learning: [Paste the full ''active_learning'' object here].

  - Scaffolding: Progressive 4 layers [Paste the full ''scaffolding'' object here].

  - Ensure coverage of research context: Publicly-Trusted Certificates, CA/RA/Subscriber/Relying Party roles, CPS, DV (domain
  control), OV (org validation), EV; BR aspects like certificate profiles (key sizes ≥2048-bit, validity ≤398 days), identity
  verification, lifecycle (issuance/renewal), revocation (OCSP/CRL), auditing/logging/monitoring. Address voter completeness:
  Full identity verification, revocation procedures, key sizes, validity periods.


  Generate 80-100 high-quality flashcards following this exact schema [Paste the full ''flashcard_schema'' object here].


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''id'':1, ''type'':''basic|cloze|mcq'', ''front'':''...'', ''back'':{''answer'':''...'',
  ''explanation'':''...'', ''hints'':''...'', ''active_learning_link'':''...''}, ''bloom_level'':''REMEMBER|UNDERSTAND|APPLY|ANALYZE|EVALUATE|CREATE'',
  ''scaffolding_layer'':''1|2|3|4''}].

  Distribute evenly: Align 1-2 objectives per Bloom''s level, activities in explanations, layers in progression. Use precise
  BR details for accuracy and distractors as specified. Optimize for Anki/Spaced Repetition: Active recall, no hints on front.'
