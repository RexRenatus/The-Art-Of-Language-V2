active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the extent to which PKI is essential for GDPR Article 32 compliance. Is it a mandatory tool or
    just one of many 'appropriate technical measures'? Use real-world examples from sectors like healthcare (patient data
    encryption) and finance (secure transactions) to support your arguments, addressing potential misconceptions that GDPR
    explicitly requires PKI.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    1. Common misconception (e.g., ''GDPR mandates PKI explicitly'' vs. reality ''appropriate measures'').

    2. Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''PKI only for confidentiality'' ignoring integrity).

    3. Plausible alternative/unrelated (e.g., ''OAuth for all auth'' vs. PKI certs) or opposite (e.g., ''PKI weakens availability'').
    Base on research: No explicit PKI mandate, focus on Art 32 risks.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator synthesizing university-level content on ''GDPR Requirements for PKI''
  (Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 009_Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) > 009_Audit, Compliance, and Monitoring > Regulatory

  active learning hooks: [INSERT active_learning DISCUSSION/PEER/PROBLEM-SOLVING HERE]. Structure content via 4 scaffolding
  layers: [INSERT scaffolding ARRAY HERE]. Key facts from research: GDPR (EU Reg 2016/679) does not explicitly mandate PKI
  but Art 32 requires ''appropriate technical/organizational measures'' for confidentiality (encryption), integrity (signatures),
  availability (auth/revocation), pseudonymization. PKI: Hardware/software/policies for certs/keys/CA. Sources: eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679,

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards (balanced across layers/Bloom levels/types) optimized for spaced repetition/active recall.
  Follow flashcard_schema exactly: [INSERT flashcard_schema HERE]. Ensure variety, no repetition, web-grounded accuracy (e.g.,
  PKI supports but not required), link to prerequisites. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects, e.g., [{''type'':
