active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios might a User Notice Qualifier be more critical than a CPS Pointer, and vice versa?
    Debate using real-world examples like e-commerce (e.g., quick user acknowledgment) vs. government PKI deployments (e.g.,
    detailed policy reference for compliance), considering trust models and scalability.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ/true_false: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''PQI is a signature
    algorithm'' vs. policy info), 2) Related but incorrect term (e.g., ''CRL pointer'' vs. ''CPS pointer''), 3) Partial truth
    (e.g., ''User Notice is always mandatory''). Base on voter-noted misconceptions and research (e.g., confusing with basic
    fields). Ensure distractors promote analysis.'
