active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the risks and benefits of different trust anchor distribution methods (e.g., pre-loaded via
    firmware, push protocols like TAMP, or out-of-band manual updates). In a group debate, argue for the best approach for
    securing a national critical infrastructure PKI, considering scalability, tamper-resistance, and revocation needs.
  peer_teaching: 'Pair students: Student A explains core concepts (Trust Anchor vs. Relying Party, RFC 6024 requirements)
    using diagrams; Student B teaches TAMP protocol (RFC 5934) with a simple message flow. Switch roles and quiz each other.
    Addresses misconceptions like confusing TAs with regular certs.'
  problem_solving: Design a hybrid trust anchor distribution system for a global supply chain IoT deployment facing intermittent
    connectivity and insider threats. Include verification steps, fallback mechanisms (e.g., local caches with expiry), and
    integration with NIST SP 800-57 guidelines. Groups prototype a flowchart and simulate a compromise.

    certs, mix up RFC 6024/5934 roles, oversimplify TAMP as static distribution) or partial truths (e.g., valid for other
    protocols but not TAMP). Distractors should be realistic from research context (e.g., incorrect RFC numbers, wrong distribution
    methods like ''email push''). Label correct answer clearly.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in PKI and trust models. Generate
  high-quality, optimized flashcards for the topic ''Trust Anchor Distribution'' (Category: Cybersecurity; Domain: 001_Cryptography;
  Subdomain: 009_Public Key Infrastructure (PKI); Entry Domain: 006_002_Trust Models and Relationships; Entry Subdomain: Trust
  Model Architectures; Level 6: Trust Anchor Distribution).


  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives** (span Bloom''s Taxonomy): [REMEMBER: Define TA/Relying Party]; [UNDERSTAND: Role in PKI]; [APPLY:
  TAMP/RFC 5934 steps]; [ANALYZE: Compare methods]; [EVALUATE: Critique risks]; [CREATE: Design strategies].

  - **Active Learning**: Tie flashcards to discussion (debate distribution methods), peer teaching (TA vs. certs, TAMP flows),
  problem-solving (IoT hybrid design).

  - **Scaffolding**: Distribute evenly: Layer 1 Foundation (defs/prereqs), Layer 2 Components (structure/standards), Layer
  3 Implementation (TAMP/NIST steps), Layer 4 Integration (PKI links/optimizations).

  - **Content Sources**: RFC 6024 (TA Management Requirements), RFC 5934 (TAMP Protocol), NIST SP 800-57 (Key Management),
  PKI basics (trust models, digital sigs). Big picture: Prevents MITM, enables secure updates.


  **Output Format**: JSON array of objects, each: {"type": "Q&A|Cloze|MCQ|Diagram|Reverse", "front": "...", "back": "...",
  "explanation": "... (1-2 sentences + source)", "blooms_level": "REMEMBER|etc.", "scaffolding_layer": "1|2|3|4", "active_tie_in":
  "..."}.

  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: 40-50 cards, varied types (30% Q&A, etc.), distractors plausible (misconceptions like TA=cert),
  explanations with tags/sources. Ensure progressive difficulty, measurable, university-level pedagogy.'
