learning_objectives:
  remember:
  - objective: Define Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and list its core quantum principles (superposition, entanglement, Heisenberg
      Uncertainty Principle, No-Cloning Theorem).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  evaluate:
  - objective: Assess the limitations of QKD implementations (e.g., distance constraints, side-channel attacks) and evaluate
      hybrid QKD-PKI systems for real-world quantum-resistant cryptography.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Describe the step-by-step process of the BB84 protocol, including basis choice, polarization encoding, sifting,
      error correction, and privacy amplification.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  analyze:
  - objective: Compare QKD with classical key distribution methods like Diffie-Hellman, highlighting QKD's information-theoretic
      security against quantum threats (e.g., Shor's algorithm).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  understand:
  - objective: Explain how QKD detects eavesdropping through quantum state disturbances and distinguish QKD from broader quantum
      cryptography (QKD focuses on secure key exchange; quantum cryptography includes post-quantum algorithms).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  create:
  - objective: Design a basic QKD network integrating ITU-T Q.4160 standards for Quantum Key Distribution Networks (QKDNs),
      incorporating post-quantum cryptography synergies.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Quantum Key Distribution
  (QKD). Use the following optimized content, structured by scaffolding layers, learning objectives across Bloom''s Taxonomy,
  and active learning elements to generate high-quality flashcards.


  **Topic Hierarchy:** [''Cybersecurity'', ''001_Cryptography'', ''009_Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)'', ''012_Advanced PKI
  Topics'', ''Quantum-Resistant Cryptography'', ''006_Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)'']


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the full learning_objectives JSON from above]


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the full scaffolding_layers JSON from above]


  **Active Learning Integration:** Draw questions from discussion prompts, peer activities, and problem-solving exercises
  to model student-centered learning.


  **Sources for Accuracy:**

  - BB84: Bennett & Brassard, ''Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing'' (1984).

  - E91: Ekert, ''Quantum cryptography based on Bell’s theorem'' (1991).

  - ITU-T Q.4160: ''Series Q: Quantum Key Distribution Network Framework''.

  - NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization.


  **Generation Instructions:**

  - Generate exactly 25 flashcards in a JSON array.

  - Distribute across Bloom''s levels and layers: ~20% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 30% Layer 4.

  - Strictly follow the flashcard_generation_schema structure for each card.

  - Questions must be active and scaffolded (e.g., ''Apply BB84 sifting to this scenario...'').

  - Explanations: 100-200 words, pedagogical, with why distractors are wrong.

  - Ensure completeness: Cover voter priorities like QKD vs. quantum crypto, protocols, hybrids.


  Output ONLY the JSON array of flashcards. No additional text.'
