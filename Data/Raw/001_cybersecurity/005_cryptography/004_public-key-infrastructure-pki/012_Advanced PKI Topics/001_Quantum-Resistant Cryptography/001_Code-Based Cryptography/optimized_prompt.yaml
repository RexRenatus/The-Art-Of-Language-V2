  Generate high-quality Anki-style flashcards for the topic ''005_Code-Based 001_Cryptography'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > 001_Cryptography > 009_Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) > 012_Advanced PKI Topics > Quantum-Resistant 001_Cryptography
  > 005_Code-Based 001_Cryptography). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning components, 4-layer scaffolding,
  and flashcard schema exactly.


  **Contextual Knowledge:** Code-based cryptography uses error-correcting codes (e.g., Goppa) for quantum-resistant PKI. Security
  from NP-complete syndrome decoding. Key scheme: McEliece. NIST PQC finalist (Classic McEliece). Prerequisites: Linear algebra,
  basic ECC, RSA. Sources: McEliece (1978), NIST SP 800-131A Rev. 2 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/131a/r2/final), NIST
  PQC updates.


  **Instructions:**

  1. Cover all Bloom''s levels via objectives.

  2. Weave in scaffolding progression, active learning tie-ins, hands-on SageMath hints, concept maps, and real-world PKI
  apps.

  3. Strictly follow flashcard schema: Front (question), Back (answer, explanation, references, tie-in). Use distractor protocol
  for MCQs.

  4. Balance: 50-100 cards, tagged by Bloom''s level/layer/hierarchy.

  5. Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''references'':
  ''...'', ''tie_in'': ''...'', ''tags'': [''Bloom:Apply'', ''Layer:3'', ''Hierarchy:L6'']}, ...}].


  Incorporate voter consensus: Hands-on coding, NIST links, comparisons, prototypes.'
