active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue for or against using a Private CA over a Public CA for a mid-sized company launching
    both public e-commerce and internal DevOps tools. Consider factors like cost, trust management, compliance (e.g., GDPR),
    and scalability. Use evidence from NIST guidelines or real-world examples like Let's Encrypt.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol:
    rules: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1 common misconception (e.g., ''Private CAs are always cheaper short-term''),
      1 edge-case reversal (e.g., swap Public/Private pros), 1 partially correct but incomplete (e.g., ignores scalability).
      Ensure distractors are web-research grounded (e.g., from Let''s Encrypt limitations) and pedagogically valuable for
      critical thinking.'
    example:
      question: When is a Public CA preferred over Private?
      correct: Public-facing services requiring universal trust
      distractors:
      - Internal apps for cost savings
      - Custom policy enforcement
      - Avoiding root distribution
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in PKI. Topic: ''Public CA
  vs Private CA Decision Criteria'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 009_PKI > 012_Advanced PKI Topics > Managed
  PKI Services > Public CA vs Private CA Decision Criteria). Voter consensus (100%): Emphasize complete Private CA criteria
  (internal services, cost control, full management, custom policies, scalability internal, no external dependencies, trust
  distribution needs). Use research: Public CA for external trust/public services; Private for internal control/cost. Sources:
  NIST SP 800-57 (PKI best practices), Let''s Encrypt (public CA examples), AWS Private CA docs, CA/Browser Forum guidelines.
