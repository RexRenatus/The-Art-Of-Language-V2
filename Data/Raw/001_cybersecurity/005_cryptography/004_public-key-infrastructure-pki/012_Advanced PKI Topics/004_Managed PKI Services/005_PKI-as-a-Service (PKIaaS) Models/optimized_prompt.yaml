active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the pros and cons of adopting PKIaaS versus maintaining an on-premises PKI for a financial institution
    concerned with data sovereignty and regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS). Which model better balances cost, scalability,
    and security risks? Address common misconceptions, such as PKIaaS being inherently less secure than self-managed PKI.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate this optimized learning content:

  - **Learning Objectives**: [Insert the full ''learning_objectives'' array here].

  - **Active Learning**: [Insert the full ''active_learning'' object here]. Use elements to inspire scenario-based cards.

  - **Scaffolding**: [Insert the full ''scaffolding'' object here]. Generate cards progressing through layers.

  - **Research Context**: PKIaaS is cloud-based PKI management (CA, lifecycle, keys). Models: Hosted CA, Cloud PKI, BYOK.
  Providers: AWS ACM PCA, DigiCert. Benefits: Automation, scalability for Zero Trust. Misconceptions: Less secure; no management
  needed. Sources: accutivesecurity.com, sslinsights.com, ssl2buy.com, encryptionconsulting.com.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following the exact **Flashcard Schema**:

  [Insert the full ''flashcard_schema'' object here].


  Ensure pedagogical alignment: Bloom''s progression, active recall, spaced repetition friendly. Cards must address misconceptions,
  tie to real-world (e.g., cert expiry, compliance), and reference prior knowledge. Output ONLY as a numbered markdown list,
  e.g., ''**Card 1 (Basic Recall)**\n**Front:** ...\n**Back:** ...''. No introductions or extras.'
