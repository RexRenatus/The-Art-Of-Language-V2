active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between symmetric and asymmetric encryption for securing data in transit versus
    at rest. Which would you choose for a cloud storage service and why? Consider speed, key management, and security. This
    sparks critical thinking on real-world applications and misconceptions about key distribution.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions: 1) Confuse symmetric/asymmetric
    key usage (e.g., ''same key for both'' as distractor for asymmetric), 2) Mix up terms (plaintext as ''encrypted data''),
    3) Real-world errors (e.g., ''RSA faster than AES'' for speed comparison), 4) Standard violations (e.g., weak key sizes).
    Ensure distractors are realistic from NIST contexts.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Cryptography and PKI. Topic:
  ''Data Encipherment Operations'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 009_Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) > 001_PKI
  Fundamentals and Architecture > 001_Cryptographic Foundations > Data Encipherment Operations). Use this comprehensive research
  context: Data encipherment (encryption) transforms plaintext to ciphertext using algorithms and keys for confidentiality
  (CIA Triad link). Core concepts: Encryption/Decryption, Plaintext/Ciphertext, Key, Algorithm, Symmetric (AES - same key,
  fast), Asymmetric (RSA - pub/priv keys), KEM (shared secret via public channel, NIST SP 800-227: https://www.nist.gov/publications/nist-special-publication-800-227-recommendations-key-encapsulation-mechanisms).
  Standards: NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 Rev. 5: Recommendation for Key Management (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r5.pdf).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list from above]

  - Active Learning: [insert discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving from above] – Tie flashcards to these (e.g., scenario
  cards from problem-solving).

  - Scaffolding: Generate cards proportionally across 4 layers: [insert full layer descriptions from above].

  - Concept map integration: Cards on relationships (e.g., ''What branches from Data Encipherment?'').

  - Big picture: Emphasize PKI role in secure transmission.
