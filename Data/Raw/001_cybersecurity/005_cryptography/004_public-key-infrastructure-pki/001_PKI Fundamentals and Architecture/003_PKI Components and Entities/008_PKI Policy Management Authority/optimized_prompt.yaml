active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Should the Policy Management Authority (PA) be structurally independent from the Certificate Authority
    (CA) in enterprise PKIs? Debate the pros and cons, using examples from RFC 3647 (e.g., policy approval processes) and
    real-world breaches like DigiNotar (where policy failures led to compromised trust), while addressing misconceptions that
    the PA is merely administrative.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in PKI. Generate high-quality
  Anki-style flashcards for the topic ''PKI Policy Management Authority'' (Category: Cybersecurity, Domain: 001_Cryptography,

  Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (objectives: [insert learning_objectives array here]), active learning
  ([insert active_learning summaries here for context]), 4-layer scaffolding ([insert scaffolding details here]). Use research
  context: PKI framework (ibm.com), CP/CPS/PA definitions (rfc-editor.org, pki.treas.gov), NIST SP 800-57 (csrc.nist.gov)
  for key management/policy (complete Part 2 Rev. 1: key establishment techniques), RFC 3647 for CP/CPS templates/audits.

  Big Picture: PA oversees policies to build PKI trust, preventing breaches via CP/CPS compliance.
