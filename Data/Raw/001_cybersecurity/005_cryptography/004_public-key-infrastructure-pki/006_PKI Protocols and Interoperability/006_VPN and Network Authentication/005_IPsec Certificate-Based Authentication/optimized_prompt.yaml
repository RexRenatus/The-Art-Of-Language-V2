active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast IPsec certificate-based authentication with pre-shared key (PSK) authentication
    for site-to-site VPNs. Under what scenarios would you recommend one over the other, considering scalability, security,
    and management overhead? Debate the implications for zero-trust architectures.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (objectives: [insert learning_objectives array]), active learning ([insert
  active_learning object]), 4-layer scaffolding with prior knowledge/big picture/misconceptions ([insert scaffolding object]).


  Follow flashcard schema exactly ([insert flashcard_schema object]): Mix formats, atomic facts, distractors from misconceptions/partial
  truths.


  Research context: IPsec secures IP packets; cert auth uses PKI (CAs issue certs binding public keys to identities) for scalable
  VPNs vs. PSKs. Standards: RFC 4301 (IPsec), RFC 4945 (PKI profile: cert formats/trust), RFC 7296 (IKEv2 cert auth). Best
  practices: CRL/OCSP, hierarchical PKI, strongSwan/pfSense configs.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''front'': ''Question/Prompt'', ''back'': ''Answer | Explanation | Bloom Level
