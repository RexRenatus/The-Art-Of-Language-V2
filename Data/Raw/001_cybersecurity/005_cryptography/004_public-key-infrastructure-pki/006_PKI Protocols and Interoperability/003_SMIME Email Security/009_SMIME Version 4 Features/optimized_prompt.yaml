active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the security and performance trade-offs of S/MIME v4's new algorithms (e.g.,
    AES-GCM vs. legacy ciphers) and their impact on email interoperability in mixed v3/v4 environments. Support arguments
    with references to RFC 8551.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full array from ''learning_objectives'']

  - Active Learning: Use scenarios from [discussion_prompt, peer_teaching_activity, problem_solving_exercise] to inspire applied
  cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers: [insert full scaffolding descriptions]. Builds on prior knowledge (X.509
  from 009_PKI, S/MIME v3).

  - Key Content: RFC 8551 (message spec: signed/enveloped data, compression, new algos like SHA-2, AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305);
  RFC 8550 (cert handling, RFC 5280 validation); services: authentication, integrity, non-repudiation, confidentiality, compression;
  enhancements over v3.


  Generate 25-30 high-quality flashcards following this exact schema: [insert full ''flashcard_schema'']. Ensure university-level
  rigor (Bloom''s progression), web-grounded accuracy, active recall. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, no extra text.'
