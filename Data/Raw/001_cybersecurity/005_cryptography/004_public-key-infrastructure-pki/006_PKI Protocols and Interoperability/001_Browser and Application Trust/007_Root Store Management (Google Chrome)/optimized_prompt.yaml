active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Should browsers like Chrome maintain independent root store policies, or align fully with CA/Browser
    Forum standards? Debate using historical incidents like the Symantec distrust (2015), considering trade-offs in security,
    agility, and interoperability.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: Distractors must be plausible (e.g., confuse Chrome policy with CA/B Forum; mix up key rotation with
    lifetime; reference real incidents like Symantec but twist facts). Avoid random/guessing options; tie to misconceptions
    (e.g., 'Roots are user-configurable' vs. 'Managed by Chrome'). Ensure one distractor is a 'close but wrong' variant.

  Prior Knowledge: Builds on digital certificates, public-key cryptography, HTTPS.


  Sources: Chrome Root Program Policy (https://chrome-root-store.google/), CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements (https://cabforum.org),
  CCADB (https://ccadb.org/), historical analysis (Symantec 2015 distrust).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full array from ''learning_objectives'']

  - Active Learning: Use for higher Bloom''s cards (e.g., discussion for evaluate/create).

  - Scaffolding: Generate cards tagged by layer [insert full scaffolding descriptions].


  Generate flashcards following this exact schema [insert full flashcard_schema].


  Ensure cards are optimized: University-level (Bloom''s progression), active recall, spaced repetition friendly. Web-grounded
  (use research facts: e.g., key freshness requires periodic rotation). Voter-approved: Cover CA process, key freshness completion
  (''rotated periodically to limit exposure''), Symantec incident.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, e.g., [{''front'': ''...'', ...}, ...]. No extra text.'
