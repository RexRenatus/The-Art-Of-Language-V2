active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the effectiveness of Certificate Transparency in preventing misissued certificates. Provide examples
    of real-world incidents where CT could have helped (e.g., Symantec misissuances) or failed, and propose improvements to
    the CT framework, such as mandatory multi-log submission or enhanced browser enforcement.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: (1) Plausible misconception (e.g., ''CT revokes certificates'' instead
    of detects), (2) Partial truth (e.g., ''Submit to one log'' vs. two), (3) Unrelated/off-target (e.g., confuses with OCSP).
    Ensure distractors are web-grounded from common errors in CT docs.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Public Key Infrastructure
  (PKI). Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on ''Certificate Transparency Requirements'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > 001_Cryptography > 009_Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) > 006_PKI Protocols and Interoperability > Browser and Application
  Trust > Certificate Transparency Requirements). Builds on PKI basics like TLS cert issuance.


  Incorporate:

  - Research: CT mitigates misissued TLS certs via public logs (RFC 9162 v2, TLS ext); CA/B Forum reqs (submit to 2+ logs
  in 24h); terms: CT Logs, SCTs, Monitors.

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Scaffolding: [insert full 4 layers above] – tag each card.

  - Active Learning: Weave in prompts (e.g., cards sparking debate on CT effectiveness).


  Use EXACT Flashcard Schema: Mix basic Q&A and MCQ. Follow distractor protocol strictly. Ensure university pedagogy: Bloom''s
  progression, active recall.


  Output ONLY JSON array of flashcards: [{''type'': ''basic_qa'' or ''mcq'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {schema structure}},
