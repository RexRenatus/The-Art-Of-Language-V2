active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the critical vulnerabilities in ATM/POS authentication if PKI certificates
    are compromised (e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks). Connect to real-world breaches and propose mitigations using PCI PTS
    POI and P2PE.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    only'' vs. full PTS POI). Ensure 25% correct by guessing.'
