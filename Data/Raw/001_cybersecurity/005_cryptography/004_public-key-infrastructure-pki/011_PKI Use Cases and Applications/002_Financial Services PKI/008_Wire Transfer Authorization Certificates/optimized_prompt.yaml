  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving where relevant.

  - Scaffolding: Ensure even coverage: 12 Layer 1, 13 Layer 2, 13 Layer 3, 12 Layer 4.

  - Prior Knowledge: Assume basics of PKI (certs, keys, signatures).

  - Research Context: Use provided scaffolding content, standards (NIST SP 800-57/63, FFIEC, Canadian Centre ITSAP.30.1, Fedwire/CHIPS/SWIFT),
  examples (dual-control PKI), risks (fraud vectors), big picture (fraud reduction).


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly:
