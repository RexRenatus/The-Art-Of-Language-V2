  discussion_prompt: In a post-pandemic world, debate whether mandating PKI for all telemedicine platforms sacrifices accessibility
    for security. Provide real-world examples from HIPAA violations (e.g., ransomware attacks on healthcare like Change Healthcare
    2024) and counterarguments on PKI overhead versus benefits like mutual authentication.
  peer_teaching: 'Students pair up: One explains PKI components (CA, certificates, CRLs) using a telemedicine scenario (e.g.,
    secure patient authentication during video consults via TLS certificates), then switch roles for teach-back with feedback
    on accuracy.'
  problem_solving: In groups, design a PKI architecture to secure PHI transmission in RPM. Include threat modeling (ransomware,
    phishing, cert mismanagement), mitigations (PKI-enabled TLS, revocation via CRLs), and simulate a HIPAA compliance audit.
    Present and peer-review designs.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions: 1) Confuse symmetric/asymmetric
    crypto (e.g., ''uses shared keys only''); 2) Misstate HIPAA/PKI roles (e.g., ''HIPAA provides encryption, PKI only authenticates'');
    3) Real-world errors (e.g., ''CRLs optional in telemedicine''); 4) Overgeneralize threats (e.g., ''PKI prevents all ransomware'').
    Ensure distractors are 70-80% plausible to challenge understanding.'

  **Research Context (Completed):** Telemedicine delivers remote healthcare via telecom, booming post-COVID but vulnerable
  to ransomware (e.g., Change Healthcare 2024), phishing, data leaks, identity theft. PHI: Identifiable health data protected
  by HIPAA Security Rule (technical safeguards: encrypt transmissions, access controls). PKI enables: TLS/SSL (PKI certs for
  key exchange/encryption of video/PHI), mutual auth (clinician-patient/devices), digital signatures (e-prescriptions integrity),
  CRLs (revocation). Threats: Cert mismanagement, CA compromise. Vs. symmetric: PKI scales for public trust. Sources: HIPAA.gov
  (Security Rule §164.312), NIST SP 800-52 (TLS PKI), ResearchGate ''PKI in Healthcare'' (2023), HIMSS Telemedicine Security
  Report.

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full scaffolding_layers array here]. Balance flashcards across layers/objectives.

  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Reference in explanations (e.g., ''Supports debate on PKI mandate'').


  **Generation Rules:**

  - Cover all Bloom''s levels progressively (Layer 1: Remember/Understand; Layer 4: Evaluate/Create).

  - Integrate PKI specifics: TLS certs, signatures, HIPAA compliance.

  - Use flashcard_schema strictly: Mix structures, apply distractor_protocol.

  - Output ONLY JSON array of flashcards: [{''type'': ''Q&A|MCQ|Cloze'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...''}]. No extras.

  - Ensure accuracy, pedagogy, and engagement for university-level learners.'
