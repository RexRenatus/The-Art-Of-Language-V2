active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of implementing AAL3 (hardware cryptographic authenticators
    like smart cards with PKI certificates) versus AAL2 (multi-factor with biometrics) for pharmacist access to controlled
    substances in a pharmacy system. Reference NIST SP 800-63B and real-world examples like Surescripts. Justify your preferred
    level based on security, usability, and regulatory compliance (e.g., HIPAA, DEA rules).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    truth (e.g., correct level but wrong NIST doc), 3) Extreme/implausible (e.g., ignore PKI). Ensure plausible for pharmacy/PKI
    context; base on voter priorities like NIST truncation errors or PKI basics mix-ups.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in PKI and NIST standards.
  Generate 25-35 high-quality flashcards on ''Pharmacy System Authentication'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography
  > 009_Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) > PKI 014_Use Cases and Applications > Healthcare PKI Applications > Pharmacy System
  Authentication). Prioritize voter consensus: completeness (NIST SP 800-63A/B/C details, Surescripts/NCPDP examples), pedagogy
  (Bloom''s progression), scaffolding (4 layers), PKI links.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the ''learning_objectives'' array here verbatim]. Cover all objectives evenly (4-6 cards
  each).


  **Active Learning Integration:** Ensure flashcards support activities (e.g., scenario cards for problem-solving).


  **Scaffolding:** Distribute cards: ~6 Layer1, ~7 Layer2, ~7 Layer3, ~6 Layer4. Use content from [Insert ''scaffolding''
  object here verbatim].


  **Flashcard Rules:**

  - 60% MCQ (4 options, 1 correct), 40% Q/A or diagrams.

  - Tag each with Bloom''s level and layer.

  - Incorporate PKI: X.509 certs, CAs, revocation (CRL/OCSP), digital sigs for eRx.

  - NIST Completeness: 800-63A (IAL/enrollment), 800-63B (AAL/auth lifecycle), 800-63C (federation).

  - Examples: Surescripts, controlled substances MFA, FIDO2+PKI.


  **Output Format:** Strictly JSON array of flashcards matching [Insert ''flashcard_schema.structure'' here]. No extra text.'
