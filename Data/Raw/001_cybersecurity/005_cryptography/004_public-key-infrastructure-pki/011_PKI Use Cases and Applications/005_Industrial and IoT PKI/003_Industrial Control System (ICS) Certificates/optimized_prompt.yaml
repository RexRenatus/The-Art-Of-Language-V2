active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a debate format, argue for or against prioritizing certificate revocation mechanisms (e.g., CRL/OCSP)
    in ICS PKI deployments, given OT's emphasis on availability over confidentiality. Reference ISA/IEC 62443 security levels
    and real-world incidents like Stuxnet to support your position.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs: Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g., confusing PKI certs
    with ISA/IEC 62443 training certs; IT vs. OT priorities; wrong protocols like SSH instead of TLS; outdated standards).
    Ensure distractors are realistic (50% stem from voter-noted accuracy issues) but clearly incorrect per explanations.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in PKI use cases in Industrial
  and IoT environments. Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Industrial Control System (ICS) Certificates'' under
  the hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 009_Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) > PKI 014_Use Cases and Applications
  > Industrial and IoT PKI > Industrial Control System (ICS) Certificates.


  CRITICAL FOCUS: Emphasize PKI DIGITAL CERTIFICATES (e.g., X.509 for device authentication, TLS/DTLS in SCADA/PLCs/HMIs)
  in ICS/OT, NOT professional training certifications like ISA/IEC 62443. Address OT priorities (availability/integrity),
  challenges (revocation, long lifecycles), and standards integration (NIST SP 800-82, ISA/IEC 62443 crypto reqs).

  - Active Learning: Use for inspiration (e.g., debate revocation, peer-teach ICS/PKI, scenario design).

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM JSON] – Ensure coverage.


  Output EXACTLY a JSON array of 30 flashcards conforming to this schema: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD_SCHEMA FROM JSON].


  Best Practices: Questions test progressive Bloom''s (scaffolded); Explanations reference objectives/layers/standards; Distractors
  per protocol (accuracy-focused, avoid training cert confusion); Varied formats; Optimized for Anki/Quizlet (concise fronts,
  rich backs).'
