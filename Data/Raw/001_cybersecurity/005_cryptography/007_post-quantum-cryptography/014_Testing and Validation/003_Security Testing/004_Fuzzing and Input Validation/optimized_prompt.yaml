active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of allow-list versus deny-list (blacklist) input validation
    strategies. Provide examples from OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQLi) and relate how fuzzing can validate these
    choices. Encourage critical thinking on trade-offs in performance and security.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (2) Partial truth/exaggeration (e.g., ''deny-list is always better''), (3) Unrelated/off-topic (e.g., swap tool names
    like AFL with libFuzzer). Base on voter priorities (e.g., fuzzing tools, OWASP links) and research (OWASP validation goals).

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for the topic ''Fuzzing
  and Input Validation'' in Cybersecurity. Corrected topic hierarchy (not crypto-specific): Level 1: Cybersecurity > Level
  2: Testing and Validation > Level 3: Security Testing > Level 4: Fuzzing and Input Validation. Assume prior knowledge: basic
  programming (string handling), OWASP Top 10 (XSS, SQLi).


  Incorporate these learning objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE].

  Use 4-layer scaffolding: [INSERT scaffolding ARRAY HERE].

  Embed active learning hooks in explanations (e.g., ''Discuss in group: ...'').


  Content must cover: Input validation (definitions, syntactic/semantic, goals, strategies like allow/deny-list, best practices:
  data types, lengths, encodings); Fuzzing (blackbox/whitebox, mutation/generation-based, tools: AFL++, libFuzzer, honggfuzz,
  Peach Fuzzer; examples: buffer overflows, injections).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 50 flashcards strictly following this schema: [INSERT flashcard_schema.structure HERE]. Ensure
  progression: early cards Layer 1/REMEMBER, later Layer 4/CREATE. Distractors per protocol: [INSERT flashcard_schema.distractor_protocol
  HERE]. Explanations reference objectives, layers, voters (e.g., expanded fuzzing tools), and OWASP research.'
