  discussion_prompt: 'In a group debate, argue for or against the statement: ''Bitcoin''s SHA-256 PoW mining does not require
    immediate replacement due to quantum threats because Grover''s algorithm only provides quadratic speedup.'' Support with
    calculations of security impact and references to projects like QRL.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

  Key Accuracy: SHA-256 etc. are quantum-resistant for PoW (Grover''s quadratic speedup only, not exponential break like ECDSA
  signatures). NIST PQC (FIPS 204/205) targets signatures/KEMs, not mining hashes. Examples: QRL, Ethereum strategies.
