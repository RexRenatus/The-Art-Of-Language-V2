active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a post-quantum world, which cryptographic primitives (e.g., lattice-based FHE or Kyber) are most effective
    for protecting AI models from extraction attacks? Why might classical methods like RSA fail? Debate pros/cons in groups,
    citing NIST PQC standards.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
