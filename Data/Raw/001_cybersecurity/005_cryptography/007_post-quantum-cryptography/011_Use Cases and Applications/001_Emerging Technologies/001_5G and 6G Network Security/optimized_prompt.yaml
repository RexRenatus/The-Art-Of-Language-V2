  discussion_prompt: 'In a group debate, argue the urgency of PQC migration in 5G/6G: One side claims ''Harvest Now, Decrypt
    Later'' attacks on long-term keys demand immediate hybrid schemes (e.g., Kyber + ECC); the other prioritizes backward
    compatibility per 3GPP TS 33.501. Cite NIST standards and propose a consensus strategy.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Topic:** 5G and 6G 003_Network Security (Category: Cybersecurity, Domain: 001_Cryptography, Subdomain: Post-Quantum 001_Cryptography,
  Entry: 014_Use Cases and Applications > Emerging Technologies).


  **Topic Hierarchy (FIXED - use exactly):** [''Cybersecurity'', ''001_Cryptography'', ''Post-Quantum 001_Cryptography'',
  ''014_Use Cases and Applications'', ''Emerging Technologies'', ''5G and 6G 003_Network Security'']


  **Research Context (COMPLETE):** 5G enables eMBB/mMTC/URLLC via slicing/virtualization; 6G (~2030) adds AI/hyper-connectivity.
  Security threats expanded by attack surface from NFV/SDN. Classical crypto (ECC/DH in 3GPP auth) vulnerable to Shor''s (breaks
  factoring/discrete log), Grover''s (hashes/symmetric), HNDL. PQC migration: NIST FIPS 203 (ML-KEM/Kyber KEM), FIPS 204 (ML-DSA/Dilithium
  signatures), FIPS 205 (SLH-DSA); 3GPP TS 33.501 (5G security), Rel-18+ PQ study; NISTIR 8354 (''5G Network Security Design
  Principles''); ETSI 6G security visions. Concept map: Central ''5G/6G Security'' -> ''Crypto Primitives'' (PQ lattice-based),
  ''Network Slicing Security'' (per-slice keys), ''Post-Quantum Migration'' (hybrids), ''Edge Computing Risks'' (distributed
  vuln). Sources: NIST.gov, 3GPP.org, ETSI.org.


  **Learning Objectives:** [insert the 6 objectives above].


  **Active Learning Ties:** Flashcards should support discussions (e.g., HNDL debates), peer teaching (PQ vs classical), problem-solving
  (scenarios).


  **Scaffolding:** [insert 4 layers above]. Generate balanced across layers/Bloom''s.


  **Task:** Generate 20-30 flashcards following EXACT flashcard_schema. Ensure completeness, pedagogy, PQ focus. Output ONLY
  valid JSON array matching schema precisely (snake_case, 3 distractors, fixed hierarchy). No other text.'
