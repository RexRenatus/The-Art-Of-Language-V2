active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges and benefits of aligning NIST PQC transition mandates with
    regional standards like ETSI QI (EU) and CNSA 2.0 (US NSA). How might misalignments impact global supply chains? Provide
    evidence from timelines and standards.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Similar but incorrect term (e.g., Grover''s vs. Shor''s), 3) Regional variant (e.g., CNSA instead of NIST). Ensure distractors
    test nuance without being obvious. Base on real standards/timelines for educational value.'

  **Completed Research Context:**

  International Regulatory Alignment in PQC: NIST leads PQC standardization (Kyber, Dilithium, FALCON, SPHINCS+ selected 2022-2024).
  Transition timeline (NIST IR 8413): 2030 inventory quantum-vulnerable systems; 2033 deprecate RSA<3072/ECDH<384; 2035 full
  PQ migration. NIST CSF: Five functions (Identify risks, Protect assets, Detect anomalies, Respond to incidents, Recover
  operations). ISO/IEC 27001: ISMS standard with cryptography controls (A.10). ETSI QI (TS 103 837): EU quantum-safe crypto
  specs aligning with NIST. CNSA 2.0: NSA PQ profiles for national security. Global efforts: IETF PQ-TLS, ITU-T quantum-safe
  recs. Challenges: China (SM9/ZUC), harmonization via ISO/IEC 27032.
