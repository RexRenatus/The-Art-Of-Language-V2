active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In pairs, debate how NIST post-quantum cryptography transition timelines differ for industries like healthcare
    (HIPAA updates) versus finance (PCI-DSS and FFIEC guidance). Identify unique challenges, risks (e.g., regulatory delays,
    costs), and mitigation strategies for each.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Plausible errors (e.g., wrong year like 2030 instead of 2033 for CNSA 2.0; mix up FIPS 203 with 204).

    - From related but incorrect concepts (e.g., pre-quantum deadlines for PQC timelines; HIPAA for finance).

    - Edge cases (e.g., optional vs. mandatory dates).

    Ensure 1-2 distractors are ''near misses'' to promote critical analysis.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for university-level cybersecurity education, specializing in post-quantum
  cryptography migration. Topic: ''Industry-Specific Compliance Timelines'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography >
  Post-Quantum 001_Cryptography > 014_Migration Strategy and Planning > NIST Transition Timeline and Mandates > Industry-Specific
  Compliance Timelines).


  Incorporate this expanded research context: NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 Rev. 5 details key management lifecycle (generate, distribute,
  store, use, destroy keys) for security services. PQC standards: FIPS 203 (ML-KEM), 204 (ML-DSA), 205 (SLH-DSA). Timelines:
  CNSA 2.0 (quantum-resistant firmware 2025, full crypto 2033); NSM-10 (federal agencies inventory 2025, migrate by 2033);
  DoD CMMC 2.0 (PQC by 2033 for high levels); Finance (PCI-DSS v4+ PQC guidance, FFIEC alignments); Healthcare (HIPAA Security
  Rule PQC transitions post-2030); FedRAMP (cloud baselines updating to PQC). Use hybrid crypto during transition.
