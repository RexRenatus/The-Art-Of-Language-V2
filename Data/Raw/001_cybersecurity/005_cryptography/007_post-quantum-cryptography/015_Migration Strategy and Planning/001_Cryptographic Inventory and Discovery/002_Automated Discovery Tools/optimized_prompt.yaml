  prompt to generate high-quality flashcards.


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s Taxonomy):** [Insert the ''learning_objectives'' array here verbatim].


  **Active Learning Components:** Incorporate references to these in explanations: [Insert ''active_learning'' object here
  verbatim].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** Distribute cards across 4 layers: [Insert ''scaffolding'' array here verbatim]. Balance: 25% Layer
  1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4.


  **Big Picture Context:** Tools provide visibility into crypto assets for NIST-compliant PQ migration (SP 800-63-4: digital
  identity; SP 800-57: key mgmt; SCRM). Examples: Cryptosense (enterprise), Jit (cloud), tls-scanner (open-source). Prerequisites:
  Classical crypto, quantum threats.


  **Flashcard Generation Schema:** Strictly follow [Insert ''flashcard_schema'' object here verbatim]. Generate 50 flashcards:
  60% MCQ/Cloze (with 3 distractors), 20% Short Answer, 20% Application scenarios. Ensure completeness (no truncation), voter
  priorities (pedagogy, examples), web-grounded (NIST refs).


  Output ONLY a valid JSON array of flashcards. No additional text.'
