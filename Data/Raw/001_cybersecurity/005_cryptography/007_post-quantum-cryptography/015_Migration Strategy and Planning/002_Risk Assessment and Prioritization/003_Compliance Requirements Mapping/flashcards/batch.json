        "core_logic": "The core challenge NIST's PQC project addresses is the existential threat quantum computers pose to current public-key cryptography. Because quantum algorithms can solve problems intractable for classical computers, they could break widely used encryption, necessitating new, quantum-resistant algorithms.",

        "analogy": "It's like designing a new type of vault door that can withstand future, more powerful drilling equipment, rather than just addressing the limitations of current drilling tools."
