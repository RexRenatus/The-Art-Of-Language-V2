active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, take turns explaining HQC key generation vs. encapsulation/decapsulation using hand-drawn diagrams
    of quasi-cyclic codes and syndrome computation. Switch roles and quiz each other on parameter impacts.
  problem_solving: Given NIST security levels 1 and 5, select and justify appropriate HQC parameters (e.g., code dimensions,
    error rates). Calculate estimated QCSD hardness and discuss trade-offs in key size vs. speed for deployment.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in post-quantum cryptography.
  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on ''HQC Algorithm Structure'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography >
  Post-Quantum 001_Cryptography > 005_Code-Based 001_Cryptography > HQC (Hamming Quasi-Cyclic) > HQC Algorithm Structure).
  HQC is a code-based IND-CCA2 KEM, NIST PQC Round 4 finalist (security on QCSD; not yet standardized).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste array above]

  - Active Learning: Use elements for explanation fields (e.g., reference discussions).

  - Scaffolding: [paste 4 layers]; flashcards must tag layer/Bloom''s.

  - Prerequisites: Link to linear codes, syndrome decoding, KEMs.

  - Research: QCSD (NP-hard), parameters (e.g., HQC-128), pseudocode steps for KeyGen/Encaps/Decaps.

  - Visuals/Concept Map: Reference in hints (e.g., QC matrix diagram).


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: Output JSON array of objects, each with ''front'', ''back'' (nested: answer, explanation,
  hints, visual_ref, bloom_level, scaffolding_layer, topic_hierarchy), ''distractors'' [array of 3]. Ensure distractors are
  plausible per protocol. Balance coverage: objectives, layers, active learning ties. Make measurable/self-testing for university
  pedagogy (Bloom''s, active recall).'
