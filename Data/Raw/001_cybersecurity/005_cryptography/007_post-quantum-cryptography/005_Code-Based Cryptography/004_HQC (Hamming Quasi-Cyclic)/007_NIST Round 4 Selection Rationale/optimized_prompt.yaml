active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether NIST should prioritize algorithm diversity (e.g., advancing code-based
    HQC) over performance in lattice-based schemes like ML-KEM for Round 4 selections. Support your position with specific
    security analyses, performance metrics, and real-world migration challenges from NIST reports.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1 based on common misconceptions (e.g., ''HQC standardized in Round 3'' vs.
      actual Round 4 advancement), 1 from similar candidates (e.g., BIKE parameters), 1 from outdated info (e.g., pre-2024
      status).'
    - Ensure distractors are 70% plausible (real metrics twisted), 30% obvious errors.
    - Avoid giving away correct answer via patterns.

  Incorporate voter priorities: Complete NIST Round 4 details (HQC advanced March 11, 2024, as code-based backup to ML-KEM
  for diversity; security via syndrome decoding; comparisons to BIKE; ongoing as of July 2024). Use research: NIST PQC process,
  Round 4 focus on KEM backups.


  Pedagogy: Align with these learning objectives [insert learning_objectives array]. Structure content via scaffolding layers
  [insert scaffolding_layers array].


  Generate flashcards using this schema [insert flashcard_schema details]. Include active learning ties (e.g., ''Discuss in
  peer teaching: ...'').


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"front": "...", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "hints":
  ["..."], "layer": 1-4, "bloom_level": "REMEMBER", "objective_index": 1}}.


  Ensure high-quality: Active recall, spaced repetition friendly, sources cited (e.g., NIST IR 8545), no criminal content.
  Cover completeness: HQC params, metrics, rationale (diversity, security margins, performance).'
