active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'Compare the conservative security approach of Classic McEliece (relying on OW-CPA of PKE with IND-CCA2
    transformations) with more aggressive lattice-based schemes like Kyber. Debate: Is conservatism worth the larger key sizes
    in terms of real-world deployment against quantum threats? Consider misconceptions about parameter choices and post-quantum
    readiness.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    variants). Ensure 70% plausibility to challenge but not trick.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for university-level cybersecurity education on 'Classic McEliece Design'\
  \ (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > Post-Quantum 001_Cryptography > 005_Code-Based 001_Cryptography >\
  \ McEliece Cryptosystem > Classic McEliece Design). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities, 4-layer\
  \ scaffolding, and research context to create 25 high-quality flashcards.\n\nIncorporate university pedagogy: Bloom's Taxonomy\
  \ (balance levels), active learning (reference discussions/activities in explanations), scaffolding (tag each card to a\
  \ layer), voter consensus (e.g., toy params, NIST info).\n\nResearch Context: Classic McEliece is a conservative code-based\
  \ KEM finalist in NIST PQC (Round 4 alternate), providing IND-CCA2 security via OW-CPA PKE + transformations (e.g., Fujisaki-Okamoto),\
  \ based on Goppa code syndrome decoding hardness (quantum-resistant). Large keys (e.g., 261kB public key for mccleice348864)\
  \ for conservatism. Protects against quantum threats like Harvest-Now-Decrypt-Later. Sources: csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography,\
