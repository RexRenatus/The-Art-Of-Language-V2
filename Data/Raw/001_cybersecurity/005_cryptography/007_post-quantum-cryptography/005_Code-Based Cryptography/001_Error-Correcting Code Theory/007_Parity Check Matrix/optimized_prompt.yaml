active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of post-quantum cryptography, discuss how the parity-check matrix H enables syndrome decoding
    in code-based schemes like McEliece. What vulnerabilities arise if the structure of H is revealed, and how does this relate
    to error-correcting code security? (Encourage critical thinking on quantum resistance and real-world cybersecurity implications.)
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
