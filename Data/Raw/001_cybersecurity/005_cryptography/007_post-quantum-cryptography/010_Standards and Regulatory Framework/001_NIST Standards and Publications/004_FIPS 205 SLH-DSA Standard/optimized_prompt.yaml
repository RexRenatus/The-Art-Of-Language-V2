  Incorporate:

  - Research: FIPS 205 (Aug 13, 2024, https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.205) standardizes SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+-based, stateless
  hash signatures for authenticity/integrity/non-repudiation). Primitives: SHA-256, PRFs (unpredictability via XOFs). Vs.
  stateful: No signer state.

  - Voter consensus (100% approval): Completeness (PRFs: ''strengthening unpredictability of seeds''; sources populated);
  Pedagogy (Bloom''s objectives, real-world e.g., quantum-vulnerable blockchain/software updates, analogies); Scaffolding
  (4 layers + prior knowledge); Big picture (Harvest Now Decrypt Later, national security).


  Learning Objectives: [paste the learning_objectives array here].

  Active Learning: Use elements to inspire cards (e.g., discussion on migration).

  Scaffolding: [paste scaffolding object here] - Cards tagged by layer.


  Flashcard Schema: Strictly output JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'', ''opt3'']}, ''metadata'': {...}}]. Balance Bloom''s/layers. Distractor protocol:
  [paste distractor_protocol]. Mix formats: 40% MCQ, 30% Q/A, 30% apply/create prompts. Ensure active recall, no hints on
  front. Voter pedagogy: Include analogies, examples, higher-order (analyze/compare, evaluate threats, create strategies).'
