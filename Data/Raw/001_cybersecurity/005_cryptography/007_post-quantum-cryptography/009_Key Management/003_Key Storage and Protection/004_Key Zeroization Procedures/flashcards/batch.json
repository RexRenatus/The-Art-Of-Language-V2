NIST SP 800-57 emphasizes that compromised keys must be destroyed immediately and thoroughly to prevent attackers from using them to decrypt data or impersonate legitimate users. This immediate destruction is paramount because the key's security is already broken.",

Key zeroization aims for purging because cryptographic keys are highly sensitive, and even residual data could be exploited.",
