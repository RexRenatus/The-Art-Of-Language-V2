A Public Key Transport Key is like a very strong, complex lock that's publicly known but hard to pick. A Private Key Transport Key is like a simpler, secret key that you use to lock the box containing the message. You'd want to change the secret key more often than you'd worry about the public lock being broken."

The expiration date limits the window of risk, ensuring that even if the card details are stolen, they are only valid for a certain period."
