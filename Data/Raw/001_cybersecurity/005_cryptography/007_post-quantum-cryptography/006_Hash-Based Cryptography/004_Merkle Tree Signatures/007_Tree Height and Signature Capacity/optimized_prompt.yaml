  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using a high tree height (e.g., h=20 for ~1M signatures)
    versus a low one (e.g., h=10) in post-quantum environments: How does it impact signature size, verification speed, and
    suitability for IoT devices? Reference NIST FIPS 186-5 and quantum threats.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

  Topic: ''Tree Height and Signature Capacity'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > Post-Quantum 001_Cryptography
  > 006_Hash-Based 001_Cryptography > Merkle Tree Signatures > Tree Height and Signature Capacity). Use this research context:
  Hash-based signatures (stateful LMS RFC 8554, stateless XMSS RFC 8391) use Merkle trees where height h determines capacity
  (2^h one-time signatures) and auth path (h hashes). NIST FIPS 186-5 standardizes; quantum-resistant via hash security. Sources:
  NIST FIPS 186-5 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-5.pdf), RFC 8554 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8554),
  RFC 8391 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8391), NIST IR 8413.
