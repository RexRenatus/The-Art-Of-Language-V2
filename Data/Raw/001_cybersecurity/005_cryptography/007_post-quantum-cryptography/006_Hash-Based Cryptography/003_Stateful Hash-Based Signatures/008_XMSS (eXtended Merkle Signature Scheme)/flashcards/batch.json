      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "As a stateful scheme, XMSS requires the signer to keep track of which one-time signature (OTS) keys have been used. Each signature consumes one OTS key. If the state is not managed correctly (e.g., a key is reused, or the state is lost and reset), the security guarantees are broken, potentially allowing an attacker to forge signatures. This state management is the primary security consideration.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The first distractor incorrectly suggests the public key needs updating. The second distractor makes an incorrect assumption about signature size growth related to state. The third distractor introduces replay attacks, which are a distinct security concern from the core state management issue.",
        "analogy": "Using XMSS is like using a book of unique, single-use raffle tickets. The critical security implication is that you MUST keep track of which ticket numbers have already been drawn. If you accidentally use a ticket number twice, the integrity of the raffle is compromised."
