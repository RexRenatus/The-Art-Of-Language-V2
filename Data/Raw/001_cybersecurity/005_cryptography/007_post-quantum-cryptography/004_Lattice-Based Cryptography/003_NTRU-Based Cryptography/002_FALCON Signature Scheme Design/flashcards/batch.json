Compactness doesn't directly cause leakage, and the NTRU structure itself isn't the leak, but how it's operated upon.",
        "analogy": "Imagine a spy trying to learn a secret code. If the code-maker has to re-write the entire secret codebook every time they send a message ('sign_dyn'), the spy has more chances to observe and decipher the writing process (leakage)."
