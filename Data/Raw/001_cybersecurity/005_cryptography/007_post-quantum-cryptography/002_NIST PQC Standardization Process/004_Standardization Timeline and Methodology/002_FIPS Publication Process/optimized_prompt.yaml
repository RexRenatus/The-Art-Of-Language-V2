  analyze:
  - objective: Analyze relationships
    verbs:
    - analyze
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the pros and cons of the FIPS publication process in ensuring cryptographic standards like post-quantum
    algorithms (e.g., ML-KEM in FIPS 203) are both rigorously secure and rapidly adoptable by industry and federal agencies.
    How might process delays, such as extended public comment periods, impact national cybersecurity readiness against quantum
    threats?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full array from ''learning_objectives'']

  - Active Learning: [insert summaries from ''active_learning'']

  - Scaffolding: Ensure 6-7 cards per layer [insert full ''scaffolding'' descriptions]; cover all Bloom''s levels proportionally.

  - Research Context: FIPS steps (Announcement of need, solicitation, draft, public comment, revision, Secretary approval,
  Federal Register per NIST IR 7977); PQC ties (FIPS 203/ML-KEM, 204/ML-DSA, 205/SLH-DSA in 2024 post-PQC rounds); NIST develops,
  Secretary approves.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: [insert full ''flashcard_schema'']. Output a JSON array of 25 flashcards: [{''front'':
  ''...'', ''back'': {''correct_answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...''}}, ...]. Vary question types (recall steps, sequence
  matching, scenario application) for active recall. Ensure pedagogical alignment: measurable, scaffolded, with distractors
  promoting analysis.'
