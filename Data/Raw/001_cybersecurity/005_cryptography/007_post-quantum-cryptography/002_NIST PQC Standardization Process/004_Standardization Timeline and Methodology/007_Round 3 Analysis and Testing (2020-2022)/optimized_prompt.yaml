  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning Hooks: Reference discussions/trade-offs in explanations (e.g., ''Discuss in peer teaching: Kyber vs. SABER
  efficiency'').

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL LAYERS FROM ABOVE]. Map every card to a layer.

  - Prior Knowledge: Assume basics of Rounds 1-2, RSA/ECC vulns, Shor''s algorithm.

  - Voter Consensus: Emphasize completeness on outcomes (2022 selections: Kyber (KEM), Dilithium/FALCON/SPHINCS+ (sigs));
  include visual timeline cards.

  - Research Context: Round 3 (2020-2022) narrowed 7 candidates via cryptanalysis/benchmarks; sources NIST.gov.


  Generate flashcards using EXACT schema: [INSERT FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Output as JSON array of objects, each with ''type'',
  ''front'', ''back'' (nested), ''bloom_level'', ''layer'', ''hierarchy_tag''. Ensure pedagogical depth: explanations tie
  to Bloom''s progression, active learning, and real-world apps. Distractors must be educationally valuable (teach misconceptions).
  No fabrication—stick to verified facts (e.g., 7 Round 3 candidates, specific 2022 winners).'
