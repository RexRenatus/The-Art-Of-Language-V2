active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether multivariate schemes like Rainbow should be pursued further in post-quantum
    cryptography despite recent breaks, or if resources should shift entirely to lattice- or hash-based alternatives. Support
    with evidence from NIST evaluations, attack details (e.g., Beullens 2022), and performance metrics.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Distractor 2: Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Secure against all quantum attacks'' ignoring 2022 breaks)'
    - 'Distractor 3: Plausible opposite/error (e.g., ''Slow signing'' when Rainbow is fast)'
    - 'Ensure 4 options total: 1 correct, 3 distractors; no ''all/none'' traps'

  \ (keygen/sign/verify), NIST history (Round 3 finalist, 2022 withdrawal due to MinRank/differential/Beullens algebraic attacks\
  \ solving MQ efficiently), comparisons, challenges/research.\n\nIncorporate these pedagogical elements:\n- Learning Objectives:\
  \ [Paste the full learning_objectives array here]\n- Scaffolding: Use 4 layers progressively [Paste scaffolding array].\n\
  - Active Learning: Draw from exercises for scenario cards [reference active_learning].\n- Ensure Bloom's coverage: 15 cards\
