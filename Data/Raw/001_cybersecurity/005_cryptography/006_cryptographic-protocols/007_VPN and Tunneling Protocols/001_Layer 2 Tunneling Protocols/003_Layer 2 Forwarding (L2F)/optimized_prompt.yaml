active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate why L2F became a Historic protocol (per RFC 2341) and evaluate its security weaknesses (e.g.,
    lack of native encryption, reliance on PPP authentication) compared to L2TP/IPsec, considering advancements in cryptographic
    protocols and modern VPN standards.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    1. Common misconception (e.g., confuse L2F port with L2TP''s 1701).

    2. Related but incorrect concept (e.g., mix LNS role with PPTP NAS).

    3. Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''L2F has IPsec'' when it doesn''t).

    Ensure distractors are realistic for cybersecurity learners, drawing from similar protocols (L2TP, PPTP).'
