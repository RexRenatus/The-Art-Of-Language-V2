        "core_logic": "The fundamental difference lies in the cryptographic primitives used. Modern VPNs like OpenVPN and WireGuard employ strong, vetted algorithms (e.g., AES, ChaCha20) and secure authentication, unlike PPTP's weak MPPE and MS-CHAP v2.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Modern protocols also use tunneling. While PPTP has compatibility, its security is paramount. Open-source vs. proprietary is a licensing difference, not the core security distinction.",
        "analogy": "Comparing PPTP to OpenVPN/WireGuard is like comparing a flimsy, old lock on a shed (PPTP) to a high-security vault door (modern VPNs); both aim to secure, but with vastly different effectiveness."

        "core_logic": "The core issue with MPPE is its inherent cryptographic insecurity; it has known vulnerabilities that allow attackers to decrypt traffic, rendering the 'encryption' ineffective for protecting sensitive data. This makes it unsuitable for secure VPNs.",
