  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the continued use of PPTP in legacy systems today: Given its known vulnerabilities
    like MS-CHAPv2 cracking and RC4 weaknesses, should organizations maintain it for compatibility, or immediately migrate?
    Support arguments with references to RFC 2637 and real-world exploits.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards covering:

  - Learning objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Scaffolding layers: [insert full scaffolding above], progressing from foundation to integration.

  - Prerequisites: TCP/IP, PPP, basic VPNs.

  - Key content: RFC 2637 (PPTP v2 standard, errata), dual-channel (TCP 1723 control, GRE 47 data), PAC/PNS, PPP encapsulation,
  vulnerabilities (MS-CHAPv2 crackable in minutes, RC4 flaws, GRE exposure, deprecated).

  - Active learning ties: Include cards prompting analysis/evaluation (e.g., compare to L2TP/IPsec, migration scenarios).


  Use flashcard schema:

  [insert full schema above].

  Vary formats: 40% MCQ, 30% cloze, 20% short answer, 10% diagram description.

  Ensure progression: 20% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 30% Layer 4.

  Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'',
