active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how forward secrecy in WPA3 via SAE addresses WPA2's PSK vulnerabilities
    (e.g., KRACK, offline brute-force). Consider implications for personal vs. enterprise networks and future post-quantum
    readiness. Support claims with references to IEEE 802.11 standards.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules: '3-4 options for MCQs. Base on voter-specified misconceptions: 1) Confuses FS with backward secrecy or future-only
      protection; 2) Attributes FS to WPA2 PSK; 3) Misstates SAE as symmetric-only; 4) Ignores Dragonfly/ephemeral keys; 5)
      Overstates post-quantum readiness. Ensure plausible (e.g., ''SAE uses pre-shared session keys'' vs. ephemeral).'

  (Topic Hierarchy: Level 1 Cybersecurity → Level 2 001_Cryptography → Level 3 001_Cryptographic Protocols → Level 4 004_Wireless
  Security Protocols → Level 5 WPA3 Security Enhancements → Level 6 Forward Secrecy in WPA3). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s
  Taxonomy objectives [insert list above], 4-layer scaffolding [insert scaffolding above], active learning ties [reference
  activities for engagement]. Incorporate research: FS via SAE (Dragonfly key exchange, RFC 7664), protects past sessions
  post-compromise, addresses WPA2 PSK flaws (offline attacks). Big picture: Advances WPA3 toward robust wireless security.
  Concept map: FS → SAE → Dragonfly → Session Keys. Standards: IEEE 802.11-2016, Wi-Fi Alliance. Prior knowledge: WPA2 vulnerabilities.
