      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The core benefit of Forward Secrecy (FS) in EAP-AKA' FS (RFC 9678) is that session keys are derived from ephemeral secrets, independent of the long-term key. Therefore, if the long-term key is compromised, past session keys remain secure, and historical communications cannot be decrypted. Systems without FS would allow decryption of past sessions once the long-term key is known.",
        "distractor_analysis": "FS protects past sessions, not future ones, and doesn't automatically invalidate or regenerate keys. The key differentiator is the protection of historical data.",
        "analogy": "Imagine a master key (long-term key) to a storage facility. Without FS, if the master key is stolen, all previously locked storage units can be opened. With FS, each unit was locked with a unique, temporary key generated at the time of locking. Stealing the master key later doesn't help open those previously locked units."
