active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using EAP-FAST versus certificate-based methods like
    EAP-TLS in a corporate wireless network with mixed legacy and modern devices. Consider factors like deployment cost, performance
    (e.g., handshake speed), and security resilience against eavesdropping or credential theft. Support arguments with references
    to RFC 5422 and real-world attack scenarios.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    with EAP-TLS), (2) Common errors (e.g., ''Only uses TLS, no symmetric crypto''), (3) Related concepts (e.g., mix PEAP
    features), (4) Edge cases (e.g., outdated Cisco-only assumption). Ensure 70% plausibility to challenge learners.'

  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives** (Bloom''s Taxonomy): [Insert full learning_objectives array here].

  - **Scaffolding Layers**: Generate 20-30 flashcards distributed across 4 layers: [Insert full scaffolding object here].
  Aim for 5-8 per layer, progressing from basic recall to integration.

  - **Active Learning Hooks**: End each flashcard back with a mini-task inspired by [Insert full active_learning object here],
  e.g., discussion-style question or problem-solving scenario.

  - **Content Completeness**: Cover key features: PAC provisioning (Phase 0, in-band/out-of-band), tunnel establishment (Phase
  1, TLS/symmetric with PAC-Opaque), protected auth (Phase 2, inner methods like MS-CHAPv2/GTC), mutual auth, fast re-auth,
  no client certs needed. Comparisons: vs. PEAP (similar tunnel, but FAST faster/no certs), EAP-TTLS. RFCs: 5422 (provisioning),
  4851 (EAP-FAST). Prior links: EAP (RFC 3748), 802.1X, TLS.


  **Output Format**: JSON array of flashcards. Each: {"id":1, "front":"Question text", "back":{"answer":"Correct answer",
  "explanation":"Detailed explanation...", "distractors":["A: wrong1 (why)", ...] if MCQ}, "metadata":{"blooms_level":"REMEMBER",
  "layer":1, "type":"MCQ"}}.


  Strictly follow the flashcard_schema: Varied question types, plausible distractors, explanations with sources. Ensure university-level
  pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, no spoilers on front.'
