active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios would you recommend WPA-Enterprise over WPA-Personal, and what are the key challenges
    in implementation? Debate using real-world examples like university campuses (high user density, need for individual auth)
    versus small business networks (PSK simplicity vs. scalability risks). Consider cryptographic implications like key hierarchy
    and PFS.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  \ (802.1X).\n\nGenerate 24 high-quality flashcards (6 per scaffolding layer) covering all learning objectives across Bloom's\
  \ Taxonomy (Remember/Understand: 30%, Apply/Analyze: 40%, Evaluate/Create: 30%). Ensure progressive complexity via scaffolding\

  \ authenticator=AP, RADIUS=AAA server), EAP methods (EAP-TLS mutual auth/PFS, PEAP vulns), key hierarchy (PMK/PTK), AES-CCMP.\
  \ Address misconceptions (e.g., confuses with PSK, RADIUS optional, MS-CHAPv2 dict attacks). Include prior knowledge: Builds\
  \ on WPA-Personal PSK limitations.\n\nUse EXACTLY this schema for each flashcard:\n{\n  \"front\": \"Question stem? A) Opt1\
