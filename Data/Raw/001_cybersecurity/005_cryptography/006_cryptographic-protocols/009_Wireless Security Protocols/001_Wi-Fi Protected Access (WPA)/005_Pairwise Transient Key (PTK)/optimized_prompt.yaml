active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss the role of PTK in the 4-Way Handshake. How does it prevent common Wi-Fi attacks like dictionary
    attacks on PSK? Compare PTK with GTK, focusing on pairwise vs. group keys and security trade-offs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    confuse PTK with PMK/static key, mix ANonce/SNonce, overlook PRF inputs, conflate with GTK). Ensure distractors are 70%
    similar to correct answer but contain 1-2 key errors. Reference voter-noted misconceptions like PTK being static or identical

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list from above]

  - Active Learning: Use discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving to inspire analytical cards (e.g., ''Why does PTK prevent
  dictionary attacks?'').

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [insert full scaffolding from above].

  - Prior Knowledge: Link to symmetric encryption/session keys (TLS analogy).

  - Research Context: PTK from IEEE 802.11i (RSN, 4-Way Handshake); derived via PRF from PMK, nonces, MACs; subkeys KCK/KEK/TK
  for CCMP; vs. GTK; KRACK vuln.


  Generate flashcards following this EXACT schema for each:

  Back:

  **Answer:** [correct response]

  **Explanation:** [detailed, pedagogical rationale with Bloom''s/scaffolding refs]

  **Bloom Level:** [level]

  **Scaffolding Layer:** [1-4]

  **Tags:** [relevant tags]


  For MCQs: Front includes options A-D; distractors per protocol. Output 50 flashcards in a numbered list, ensuring progressive
  complexity, university pedagogy (Bloom''s, active learning), and voter consensus (e.g., derivation formula, PTK vs GTK,
  KRACK). No duplicates; high-quality, exam-ready.'
