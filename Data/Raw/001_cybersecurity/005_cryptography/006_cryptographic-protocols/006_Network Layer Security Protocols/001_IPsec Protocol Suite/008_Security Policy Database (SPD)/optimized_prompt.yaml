active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the security implications of using 'bypass' actions in an SPD for internal
    enterprise traffic versus protecting it with IPsec. Reference RFC 4301 and consider real-world risks like insider threats
    or lateral movement in NIST SP 800-77 scenarios. What trade-offs exist between performance and security?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For multiple-choice (40% of cards): 4 options (1 correct, 3 distractors). Distractors based on: (1)
    Common misconceptions (e.g., confuse SPD with SAD or general NIST policies); (2) IPsec edge cases (e.g., wrong selector
    like port instead of protocol); (3) Outdated/mixed standards (e.g., IKEv1 vs IKEv2); (4) Real-world errors (e.g., permissive
    bypass). Ensure distractors are plausible per RFC 4301.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in IPsec Protocol Suite (Domain:\
  \ 001_Cryptography > 001_Cryptographic Protocols > 006_003_Network Layer Security Protocols > IPsec > Security Policy Database\
  \ (SPD)). Focus EXCLUSIVELY on IPsec SPD per RFC 4301 (not general NIST policies). Generate 25 high-quality flashcards optimized\
  \ for spaced repetition, Bloom's Taxonomy, and active recall.\n\n**Context & Accuracy:** SPD matches outbound/inbound IP\
  \ packets to selectors (IPs, ports, protocols) and actions (protect via AH/ESP/SA, discard, bypass). Relates to SAD (SA\
  \ params), PAD (peer auth). Refs: RFC 4301 (core arch), RFC 4303 (ESP), RFC 7296 (IKEv2), NIST SP 800-77 (guide).\n\n**Learning\
