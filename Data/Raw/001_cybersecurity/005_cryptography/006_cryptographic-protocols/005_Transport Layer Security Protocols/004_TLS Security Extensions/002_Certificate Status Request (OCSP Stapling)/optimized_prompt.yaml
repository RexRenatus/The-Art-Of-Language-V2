  discussion_prompt: 'Compare OCSP Stapling with traditional OCSP and CRL checking. Debate: Does OCSP Stapling truly enhance
    privacy by preventing CA tracking of client connections, or does it introduce staleness risks that could allow revoked
    certificates to be used briefly? Use real-world examples like the Heartbleed aftermath or key compromises in banking sites.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

      server-side query), ''Unlimited validity'' (staleness risk), ''TLS 1.2 only'' (works in 1.3).'
    - 'Use partial truths: e.g., ''Reduces latency'' as distractor for advantages but twist to ''Eliminates all revocation
      checks''.'
    - 'Incorporate voter priorities: Privacy vs. staleness, unsigned responses, TTL misconfigs.'
    - 'Ensure plausibility: Draw from RFC 6961 errors, real-world fails (e.g., Heartbleed cached responses).'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Cryptographic Protocols
  under TLS Security Extensions. Topic: Certificate Status Request (OCSP Stapling). Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography
  > 001_Cryptographic Protocols > 005_Transport Layer Security Protocols > TLS Security Extensions > Certificate Status Request
  (OCSP Stapling).


  **Core Content:** Integrate research: OCSP Stapling (RFC 6961) allows servers to staple signed OCSP responses (good/revoked/unknown
  status, TTL 1-7 days) in TLS handshake, improving privacy (server queries CA, not clients) and performance over traditional
  OCSP/CRL. Advantages: Reduced latency, CA tracking prevention. Disadvantages: Server load, staleness risks, config errors.


  **Pedagogy:** Use these exact learning objectives: [insert learning_objectives array]. Incorporate active learning: [insert
  discussion_prompt, peer_teaching_activity, problem_solving_exercise]. Scaffold in 4 layers + prior knowledge: [insert scaffolding
  object].


  **Generation Rules:** Create 50 flashcards spanning Bloom''s levels (8-10 per major level). Use flashcard_schema exactly:
  JSON array output only. 40% multiple choice with distractors (follow distractor_protocol strictly). Ensure university-level:
  Active recall, spaced repetition friendly, misconceptions addressed. Link to prior knowledge (X.509, TLS handshake). Sources:
  RFC 6961, real-world (Heartbleed). No fluff; precise, measurable.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards matching the schema.'
