active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between prioritizing cipher suites for maximum security (e.g., TLS 1.3 only with
    ChaCha20-Poly1305) versus broad compatibility in enterprise environments. Reference NIST SP 800-52 Rev. 2 and RFC 9325/8446,
    considering forward secrecy, quantum resistance, and performance impacts.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

      standard (e.g., TLS 1.0 suite), 3) Performance trap (e.g., high-security but slow suite). Ensure distractors are realistic
      from real cipher lists, avoid obvious errors. Base on voter priorities like forward secrecy misprioritization.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Cipher Suite Prioritization''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 001_Cryptographic Protocols > 005_Transport Layer Security Protocols
  > TLS Cipher Suites > Cipher Suite Prioritization). Voter consensus: 100% approval on pedagogy, scaffolding, etc.


  Incorporate Research Context: Cipher suites include key exchange (ECDHE), auth (ECDSA), encryption (AES-GCM), MAC (Poly1305/SHA).
  Prioritization orders strongest first in TLS handshake per NIST SP800-52 Rev.2, RFC8446/9325. Focus: forward secrecy, quantum
  resistance, performance.

  Scaffolding: Generate flashcards balanced across 4 layers [insert scaffolding details].


  Active Learning Integration: Each flashcard back links to one activity (discussion/peer/problem-solving) [insert active
  learning].


  Schema: Output ONLY a JSON array of 50 flashcards following [insert flashcard_schema structure/types/distractors]. Ensure
  progression: 20% Layer1/REMEMBER-UNDERSTAND, 30% Layer2/APPLY, 30% Layer3/ANALYZE-EVALUATE, 20% Layer4/CREATE. Vary types,
