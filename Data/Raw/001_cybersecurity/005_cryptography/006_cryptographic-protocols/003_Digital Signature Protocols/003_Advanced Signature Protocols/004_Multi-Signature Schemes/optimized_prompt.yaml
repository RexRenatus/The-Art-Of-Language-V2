  discussion_prompt: Discuss the trade-offs between n-of-n schemes like MuSig2 and t-of-n threshold schemes like FROST in
    terms of security, efficiency, and usability. Provide real-world examples from cryptocurrency wallets where one might
    be preferred over the other, and debate potential vulnerabilities such as single points of failure or collusion risks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

  Use this optimized pedagogical framework to generate 50 high-quality flashcards:


  **Learning Objectives:** [INSERT ARRAY FROM ABOVE]


  **Active Learning Integration:** Weave in concepts from discussion (trade-offs MuSig2/FROST), peer teaching (key agg/signing),
  problem-solving (wallet design) as explanation hooks.


  **Scaffolding:** Distribute flashcards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 30% Layer 3, 20% Layer 4. Progress from simple recall
  to synthesis.


  **Content Sources:**

  - Core concepts: Multisig (group signing to single sig), aggregate pubkey, n-of-n (MuSig2), t-of-n (FROST). Key agg, joint
  sig, complexities.

  - Protocols: MuSig2 (n-of-n, Schnorr-based, 2-3 rounds), FROST (t-of-n threshold, full details: key gen, signing rounds).

  - Prior: BIP340 Schnorr.

  - Corrections: FROST is t-of-n, not n-of-n.

  - Research: BIP340/327 standards, wallet apps.


  **Flashcard Generation Rules:**

  - Cover all objectives/Bloom levels evenly.

  - 70% MCQ (4 opts, distractors per protocol), 20% Cloze (fill blanks in processes), 10% Short Answer (e.g., ''Compare complexities'').

  - Output ONLY a JSON array of 50 flashcards, each matching EXACT schema: {''type'', ''front'', ''back'': {''correct_answer'',
  ''explanation''}, ''bloom_level'', ''scaffolding_layer'', ''tags'': []}.

  - Ensure accuracy, no criminal advice. Vary difficulty, active recall focus.'
