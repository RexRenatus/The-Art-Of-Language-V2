active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the strengths and weaknesses of BAN Logic compared to automated tools like
    Tamarin or ProVerif for verifying authentication protocols. Provide examples from real-world protocols like Kerberos where
    BAN might fail, and propose how it could be extended.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., mix Jurisdiction with Recognition), 3) Edge cases from examples (e.g., beliefs not derived in flawed protocols),
    4) Real voter errors (e.g., NIST terms like ''Claimant'' instead of ''Principal''). Ensure 1-2 distractors are ''almost
    correct'' to test deep understanding.'

  Topic: BAN Logic for 002_Authentication Protocols (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 001_Cryptographic Protocols
  > 013_Protocol Security Analysis and Attacks > Protocol Verification Methods > BAN Logic for 002_Authentication Protocols).
  Focus exclusively on BAN Logic (Burrows-Abadi-Needham): notations (A |= X, A ⊲ X, #X, A ⊳ X, A ↔ K, N(X)), assumptions (Jurisdiction,
  Recognition, etc.), inference rules (Message Meaning, Nonce Verification, etc.), analysis steps (idealize, assume, derive,
  verify goals), examples (Needham-Schroeder, Kerberos, Wide-Mouth-Frog), limitations, and extensions (GNY/AT). Ignore NIST
  SP 800-63 or unrelated auth terms.
