active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the security trade-offs of different OAuth 2.0 grant types (e.g., Authorization Code with PKCE
    vs. Implicit vs. Password Credentials). Which is best for a mobile app integrating with a third-party API, and why? Consider
    common attacks like CSRF, token interception, or authorization code injection, referencing RFC 6819 OAuth 2.0 Threat Model.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    type). Ensure distractors promote analysis.'

  Incorporate research context: OAuth 2.0 framework for third-party access (supersedes RFC 5849); roles (Resource Owner, Client,
  Authorization Server, Resource Server); grants (Authorization Code, Implicit, Password Credentials, Client Credentials);
  access/refresh tokens; extensions (RFC 7636 PKCE, RFC 6819 Threat Model, RFC 8707 Resource Indicators); security (CSRF,
  token leakage, discouraged flows).


  Use provided learning objectives (span Bloom''s: Remember e.g., list roles; Understand e.g., explain grants; Apply e.g.,
  demo code flow; Analyze e.g., compare grants; Evaluate e.g., critique password grant; Create e.g., design integration).
  Integrate active learning (discussion on trade-offs, peer teaching roles, problem-solving flow design). Follow 4-layer scaffolding
  (Layer 1: Foundation/terms; Layer 2: Components/grants; Layer 3: Flows/implementation; Layer 4: Extensions/security).


  Generate 75 high-quality flashcards per the schema: Each as JSON object {''front'': {''question'': ''...'', ''type'': ''MCQ/cloze/etc.'',
  ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': #}, ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''A'',
  ''B'', ''C''], ''references'': ''...''}}. Follow distractor protocol strictly. Ensure spaced repetition optimization: concise
  fronts for recall, rich backs for understanding. Cover completeness (PKCE, threats), pedagogy (progressive Bloom''s), big
  picture (delegated access evolution). Output as JSON array of flashcards.'
