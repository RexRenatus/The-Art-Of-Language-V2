active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a multi-SP federated environment, debate the trade-offs between IdP-initiated vs. SP-initiated SAML
    Single Logout. Consider security (e.g., preventing session hijacking), user experience (seamless vs. partial logout),
    and implementation complexity (e.g., endpoint configuration). Cite potential vulnerabilities if one approach is chosen
    over the other, such as incomplete session termination leading to exploits like the 2018 Samlrioter vulnerability.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    examples:
    - Confusing SLO with SSO (e.g., 'Initiates new sessions across SPs')
    - Misunderstanding roles/bindings (e.g., 'Terminates only IdP session', 'Uses only HTTP-POST', 'SP handles global logout')
    - Initiation/flow errors (e.g., 'Requires separate logout per SP', 'SP-initiated skips IdP')
    - Security misconceptions (e.g., 'SLO is optional for session security')
    - Vulnerability ties (e.g., 'Prevents all attacks like Samlrioter automatically')
    rules: Distractors plausible, stem from voter/research misconceptions. Plausibly wrong but identifiable with explanation.
      Vary across cards.
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in SAML protocols. Generate\
  \ high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized flashcards for 'SAML Single Logout' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography\
  \ > 001_Cryptographic Protocols > 011_007_Federated Identity and Single Sign-On Protocols > SAML > SAML Single Logout).\
  \ Base content on SAML 2.0 standards (OASIS: Core, Bindings, Profiles), research (SLO terminates all sessions via IdP/SP\
  \ interactions, HTTP-Redirect/SOAP bindings, IdP/SP-initiated flows, reverses SSO, prevents hijacking), voter priorities\
  \ (completeness on bindings, pedagogy via Bloom's, activities, scaffolding, assessments), and provided elements (objectives,\
  \ active learning, scaffolding).\n\nIncorporate university pedagogy: Align to Bloom's objectives, inspire active learning\
  \ (e.g., cards prompting debate-like analysis), scaffold from foundation to integration, link to prior SAML SSO knowledge.\n\
  \nOutput ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each strictly following this schema:\n{\n  \"type\": \"...\",\n  \"question\"\
  : \"...\",\n  \"answer\": \"...\",\n  \"explanation\": \"...\",\n  \"options\": [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"] (for MCQ only;\

  Easy|Medium|Hard\"\n}\n\nEnsure active recall (questions avoid cues), explanations teach deeply (cite standards, vulnerabilities\
  \ like Samlrioter, trade-offs), distractors per protocol (common errors: SLO=SSO confusion, binding mix-ups, partial termination\
  \ myths). Cover all objectives/scaffolding layers evenly. Generate 25 flashcards."
