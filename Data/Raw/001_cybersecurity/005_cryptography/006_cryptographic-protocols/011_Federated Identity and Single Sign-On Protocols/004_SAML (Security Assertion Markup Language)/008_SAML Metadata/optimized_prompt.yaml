active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a zero-trust architecture, how does SAML Metadata facilitate trust establishment without relying on
    manual configuration? Discuss potential risks if metadata is tampered with and propose mitigation strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 distractors per MCQ card: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Metadata handles user assertions
    directly'' vs. ''describes endpoints''), 2) Confusable term (e.g., ''SOAP endpoint'' vs. ''AssertionConsumerService''),
    3) Partial truth (e.g., ''Optional signing'' vs. ''Recommended for security''). Ensure distractors are plausible from
    research context/voter suggestions, avoid obvious errors. For non-MCQ, suggest 2-3 common pitfalls in explanation.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in SAML Metadata (Topic Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 001_Cryptographic Protocols > 011_007_Federated Identity and Single Sign-On Protocols
  > SAML > SAML Metadata). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities, scaffolding layers, prior knowledge
  connections (XML/SOAP, auth/SSO), big picture (federated SSO in zero-trust), concept map, key terms/endpoints/keys/sources
  (OASIS SAML V2.0), and research context to generate high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized flashcards.


  Incorporate Bloom''s progression: Mix REMEMBER (defs), UNDERSTAND (roles), APPLY (steps), ANALYZE (compare), EVALUATE (risks),
  CREATE (design). Draw from active learning for scenario-based cards (e.g., discussion risks, peer-teach XML, problem-solve
  failures).


  Generate exactly 60-80 flashcards following the EXACT flashcard_schema JSON structure. Balance: Layers 1-4 as specified,
  40% MCQ (with distractors), 30% cloze/basic Q&A, 20% compare/analyze, 10% create/evaluate scenarios. Ensure active recall:
  Questions test without cues. Explanations reference objectives/layers/sources. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects,
  e.g., [card1, card2, ...]. No additional text.'
