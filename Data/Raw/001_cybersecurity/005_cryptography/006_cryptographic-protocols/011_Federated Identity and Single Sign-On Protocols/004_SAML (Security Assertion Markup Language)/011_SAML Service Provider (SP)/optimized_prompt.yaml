active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the security trade-offs of using POST vs. Artifact binding in SAML SP implementations.
    How do these choices impact replay protection and user privacy in enterprise SSO? Reference real-world examples like Okta
    integrations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [REMEMBER: Define... CREATE: Design...] (as listed above).

  - Active Learning: Embed links to discussion (e.g., binding trade-offs), peer teaching (flows), problem-solving (troubleshooting).

  - Scaffolding: Layer 1 Foundation (terms, prereqs: SAML basics/TLS/sigs), Layer 2 Components (flows/bindings), Layer 3 Implementation
  (config/validation/best practices: sigs, audience/issuer/exp, XML attacks), Layer 4 Integration (multi-protocol/zero-trust/real-world:
  Okta/Shibboleth).

  - Big Picture: Secure federation in crypt protocols for SSO/zero-trust.


  Use research context: SP relies on IdP for auth via SAML 2.0 assertions (OASIS); SSO/federation; bindings (POST/Artifact).


  Generate flashcards per schema:

  - Structure: {''front'': question, ''back'': {''answer'': correct/concise, ''explanation'': detailed w/ rationale/real-world/best
  prac/prereq link, ''distractors'': [3 for MCQ, plausible errors], ''references'': {''layer'':1-4, ''blooms'':''REMEMBER'',
  ''hierarchy'':''full path''}, ''active_learning_link'':''e.g., discussion prompt''}}.

  - Rules: 40-60 cards, balanced by layer/Bloom''s (20% L1 Remember/Understand, etc.), 50% MCQ, vary types. Distractors from
  misconceptions (SP=auth? No, consumes), gaps (no sig val), research.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects. Ensure university-level: active recall, spaced repetition optimized, measurable.'
