active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, compare SAML 2.0 with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for federated SSO scenarios.
    What are the strengths of SAML in enterprise environments (e.g., XML-based assertions for fine-grained authorization)
    versus modern web apps? Debate integration challenges and when to choose one over the others.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse IdP with SP; mix
    Bindings like POST as 'GET-only'; overlook Metadata role). Ensure distractors are web-grounded (e.g., from SAML specs
    errors) and teachable moments in explanations.

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [REMEMBER: Define key components... CREATE: Design custom architecture...]

  - Active Learning: [Discussion on SAML vs OAuth... Peer teaching concept map... Healthcare problem-solving...]

  - Scaffolding: [Layer 1: Foundation definitions... Layer 2: Components (Metadata/Bindings/Profiles)... Layer 3: Flows...
  Layer 4: Integration/security...]

  - Cover voter priorities: Complete Metadata (entity descriptors, endpoints, certs), Bindings (HTTP POST/Redirect/Artifact),
  Profiles (Web Browser SSO/ECP); Textual diagrams (e.g., Web SSO flow: 1. SP sends AuthnRequest to IdP via Redirect; 2. IdP
  authenticates, issues Assertion; 3. POST to SP); Concept map; Real-world HIPAA scenario.

  - Research Context: SAML 2.0 XML framework for assertions (authn/attr/authz); IdP creates, SP consumes; SSO/federation.
