active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In groups, debate the pros and cons of enabling SSH compression: When is it beneficial (e.g., low-bandwidth
    links like 2G for IoT devices)? When should it be disabled (e.g., high-bandwidth links, incompressible data, or to mitigate
    potential compression oracle attacks like CRIME-like exploits)? Reference RFC 4253 and OpenSSH docs.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules: 'Generate 3-4 plausible distractors per multiple-choice card based on common misconceptions: (1) Confuse compression
      with encryption (e.g., ''aes128-ctr'' as compression algo), (2) Mix RFCs (e.g., RFC 4254 instead of 4253), (3) Incorrect
      algorithms (e.g., ''gzip'' without @openssh.com), (4) Wrong application timing (e.g., after encryption), (5) Overstate
      benefits (e.g., always faster) or ignore risks (e.g., no CPU overhead).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in SSH Compression Methods
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 001_Cryptographic Protocols > 008_Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol > SSH
  Encryption and Integrity > SSH Compression Methods). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning components, 4-layer
  scaffolding, and flashcard schema to generate high-quality, pedagogically optimized flashcards.


  Key Content from Research (RFC 4253, OpenSSH):

  - Algorithms: ''none'' (no compression), ''zlib'' (RFC 4253 standard), ''zlib@openssh.com'', ''zlib-delayed'', ''gzip@openssh.com''.

  - Process: Negotiated in transport layer via SSH_MSG_KEXINIT, applied before encryption.

  - Pros: Bandwidth reduction for low-speed links.

  - Cons: CPU overhead, security risks (e.g., compression oracles).

  - Sources: RFC 4253 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4253), OpenSSH man ssh(1) (https://www.openssh.com/manual.html).


  Incorporate Bloom''s Taxonomy progression, active learning tie-ins, and scaffolding. Strictly follow the flashcard schema:
  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each with ''front'', ''back'' (containing ''answer'', ''explanation'', ''bloom_level'',
  ''scaffolding_layer'', ''active_learning_tie_in''), and ensure distractors per protocol. Generate 25 flashcards covering
  all objectives and layers.'
