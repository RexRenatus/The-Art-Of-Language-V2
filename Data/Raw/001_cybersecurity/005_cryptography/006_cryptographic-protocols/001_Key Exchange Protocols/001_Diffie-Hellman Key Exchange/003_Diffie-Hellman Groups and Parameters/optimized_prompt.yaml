active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student teaches the other how to derive a shared secret using small DH parameters (e.g., p=23,
    g=5, Alice's a=6, Bob's b=15), then switch roles and verify the computation.
  problem_solving: Given a requirement for 112-bit security per NIST SP 800-56A, select appropriate DH group sizes from RFC
    3526 or RFC 7919, justify the choice, and simulate a Logjam attack scenario to evaluate risks.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Cryptography (Domain: 001_Cryptography,
  Subdomain: 001_Cryptographic Protocols, Entry: 001_Key Exchange Protocols > Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange > Diffie-Hellman
  Groups and Parameters). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (objectives provided), active learning (discussion/peer
  teach/problem-solve), 4-layer scaffolding (Foundation > Components > Implementation > Integration), voter consensus (NIST
  SP 800-56A complete: recommends 2048-bit ~112-bit sec, 3072-bit ~128-bit; RFC 3526/7919 groups; safe primes like p=2^1024-2^64-1,
  g=2; Logjam vuln; FFC vs ECC; forward secrecy).


  Prerequisites: Basic DH key exchange, discrete log problem.

  Big picture: Parameter choice impacts security in TLS/IPsec; poor params enable attacks.
