active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the security trade-offs of TGT lifetime duration in Kerberos (e.g., short-lived for security vs.
    longer for usability). What is an optimal expiration time in enterprise environments like Active Directory? Support arguments
    with real-world examples and propose mitigations for risks like ticket theft.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    concepts (e.g., TGT issuer as TGS instead of AS); 2) Partial truths (e.g., TGT contains password instead of session key);
    3) Real-world errors (e.g., no IP in TGT, confusing with service ticket lifetime). Ensure distractors teach by contrasting
    (e.g., ''Service tickets are per-service, unlike reusable TGT'').'

  Incorporate these elements for high-quality, pedagogical flashcards:


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s Taxonomy):** [paste the full array from ''learning_objectives'']. Ensure coverage across
  levels.


  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** [paste discussion_prompt, peer_teaching_activity, problem_solving_exercise]. Reference in explanations
  (e.g., ''Relates to Golden Ticket analysis'').


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [paste full scaffolding descriptions]. Distribute flashcards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer
  3, 25% Layer 4.


  **Content Sources:** Use research context: TGT is encrypted file from KDC/AS after auth, contains session key/expiration/IP;
  Kerberos uses AS for TGT, TGS for service tickets; messages: KRB_AS_REQ/REP, KRB_TGS_REQ/REP; protects vs. MITM/replay;
  attacks like Golden Ticket (forged TGT). Complete truncated flows: Phase 1 (initial auth to AS), Phase 2 (TGT to TGS). Analogies:
  TGT like multi-entry ticket.


  **Flashcard Generation Rules:** Follow exact [flashcard_schema]. Generate 25 flashcards. Balance: 60% MCQ, 40% Short Answer.
  Prioritize voter priorities: completeness (full flows), pedagogy (objectives/activities), scaffolding (4 layers), integration
  (prereqs/attacks).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, no extra text.'
