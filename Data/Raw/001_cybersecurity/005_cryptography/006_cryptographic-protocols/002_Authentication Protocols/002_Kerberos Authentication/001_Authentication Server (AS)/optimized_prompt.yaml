  peer_teaching: 'In pairs, simulate the Kerberos AS-REQ/AS-REP exchange: one student acts as the client (sends identity and
    timestamp), the other as AS (validates key, issues TGT). Switch roles and teach-back the steps, including encryption details
    and error scenarios like wrong realm.'
  problem_solving: 'Analyze a Wireshark capture of a failed Kerberos AS exchange (e.g., symptoms: timestamp replay, invalid
    realm, or key mismatch). Diagnose the issue, propose fixes (e.g., pre-authentication, nonce), and role-play a group simulation
    of principals (client, AS, TGS) applying NIST 800-63 identity proofing. Extend to think-pair-share on SSO implications.'

    AS with TGS, swap AS-REQ/AS-REP contents, mix symmetric/PKI keys, wrong NIST ref, realm vs. principal errors). Ensure
    1 correct, options A-D shuffled. Distractors stem from voter priorities/real-world errors like replay/wrong realm.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university pedagogy (Bloom's\
  \ Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 25-35 high-quality, varied flashcards (10% definitions, 20% cloze, 40%\
  \ MCQ, 15% sequencing/process, 15% scenario/application) for the topic: **Authentication Server (AS)**.\n\n**Topic Hierarchy:**\n\
  - Level 1: Cybersecurity\n- Level 2: 001_Cryptography\n- Level 3: 001_Cryptographic Protocols\n- Level 4: 002_Authentication\
  \ Protocols\n- Level 5: Kerberos Authentication\n- Level 6: Authentication Server (AS)\n\n**Learning Objectives (span all\
  \ Bloom's levels):**\n1. REMEMBER: Define AS role, TGT, realm, AS-REQ/AS-REP.\n2. UNDERSTAND: Explain TGT issuance via symmetric\
  \ keys.\n3. APPLY: Outline client-AS authentication steps.\n4. ANALYZE: Differentiate AS vs. TGS/KDC.\n5. EVALUATE: Assess\
  \ symmetric crypto trade-offs vs. PKI/OAuth.\n6. CREATE: Design AS-integrated flow with NIST/federation.\n\n**Scaffolding\
  \ Layers (distribute cards: 6-8 per layer early-to-late):** Layer 1 Foundation (terms/prereqs), Layer 2 Components (KDC\
  \ relationships/diagram), Layer 3 Implementation (AS-REQ/REP steps), Layer 4 Integration (NIST 800-63-4, federation, SSO).\n\
  \n**Active Learning Context (inspire scenario cards):** Discussion on symmetric vs. PKI trade-offs; peer sim of AS exchange;\
  \ Wireshark diagnosis/role-play.\n\n**Research Context:** AS verifies identities, issues TGTs in Kerberos (no password sends).\
  \ Messages: AS-REQ (identity/timestamp), AS-REP (TGT/session key). NIST SP 800-63-4: identity proofing/assurance. Vulnerabilities:\
  \ replay, realm errors.\n\n**Output Format:** JSON array of objects, strictly adhering to schema:\n{\n  \"flashcards\":\
  \ [\n    {\n      \"front\": \"Question/stem (MCQ: include A-D options)\",\n      \"back\": {\n        \"answer\": \"Correct\

  \ voter consensus (e.g., TGT issuance, NIST links, diag issues)."
