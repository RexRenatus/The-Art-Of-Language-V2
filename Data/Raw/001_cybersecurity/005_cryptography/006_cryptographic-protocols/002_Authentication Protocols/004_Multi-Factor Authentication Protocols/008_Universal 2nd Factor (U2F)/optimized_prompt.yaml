active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the strengths and limitations of U2F compared to SMS-based 2FA and app-based TOTP. In what scenarios
    (e.g., financial services, enterprise logins) is phishing resistance most critical, and how does origin binding specifically
    contribute to it? Use real-world breach examples to support arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Common errors (e.g., ''U2F uses shared secrets like TOTP''), 2) Confusions with related tech (e.g., ''SMS 2FA is phishing-resistant''),
    3) Partial truths (e.g., ''Keys are software-only''). Ensure distractors are realistic from web sources (e.g., phishing
    myths).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Cryptographic Protocols.
  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards on ''Universal 2nd Factor (U2F)'' following university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy progression,
  active learning integration, 4-layer scaffolding.


  **Topic Hierarchy (for context):** Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 001_Cryptographic Protocols > 002_Authentication Protocols
  > Multi-Factor 002_Authentication Protocols > Universal 2nd Factor (U2F).


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the exact array from ''learning_objectives'' above].


  **Active Learning Components:** [Insert summaries from ''active_learning'' above]. Reference these in explanations.


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full ''scaffolding_layers'' above]. Distribute cards evenly across layers.


  **Research Context:** U2F is a FIDO Alliance open standard for phishing-resistant 2FA using hardware security keys (e.g.,
  YubiKey USB/NFC), public-key cryptography, origin binding (HTTPS-tied), FIDO Register/Authenticate messages. Key benefits:
  Phishing resistance via challenge-response signatures. Comparisons: Superior to SMS/TOTP. Sources: fidoalliance.org, manageengine.com.


  **Flashcard Generation Rules:**

  - Use exact ''flashcard_schema'' structure.

  - Ensure voter consensus: Prioritize phishing resistance, comparisons, flows, misconceptions.

  - Output: JSON array of 30 flashcards, each as {"front": "...", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "distractors_analysis":
  "..." (if MC), "related_activity": "...", "source": "...", "bloom_level": "REMEMBER", "layer": "1"}}.

  - Varied difficulty: 40% basic recall, 30% application, 30% higher-order.

  - No spoilers; explanations educational and concise.
