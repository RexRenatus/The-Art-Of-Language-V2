  **Context:** Use this comprehensive research summary:

  [FULL RESEARCH CONTEXT INSERTED: FIDO2 (FIDO Alliance standards: WebAuthn + CTAP) for phishing-resistant passwordless auth.
  Core: Passkeys (synced key pairs), public-key crypto (private key device-bound). Big Picture: Passwords -> MFA -> FIDO2/zero-trust.
  Security: Origin-bound, no secrets, attestation. Flows: Reg: key gen + sig; Auth: challenge-response. Sources: https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/,
  https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/, https://webauthn.guide/, https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/. Voter consensus: 100% on
  pedagogy, completeness, scaffolding.]


  **Pedagogy:** Align to Bloom''s objectives: [INSERT OBJECTIVES ARRAY]. Scaffolding layers: [INSERT LAYERS]. Active learning
  inspires questions (e.g., scenarios).


  **Task:** Generate 30 high-quality flashcards covering all layers/objectives/types. Balance: 12 MCQ, 6 Definition, 6 Short
  Answer, 3 Diagram, 3 Comparison.


  **Output Schema:** JSON array of objects: {''id'':1, ''type'':''MCQ'', ''front'':''Question?'', ''options'':[''A. Wrong1'',''B.
  Correct'',''C. Wrong2'',''D. Wrong3''], ''correct'':''B'', ''back'':''B. Correct answer full text.'', ''explanation'':''Rationale:
  Why correct (cite research). Bloom: APPLY, Layer:3. Distractors: A (misconception: confuses with OTP), C (overlooks origin-binding),
  D (legacy protocol). Prior link: asymmetric crypto.'', ''tags'':[''phishing'',''WebAuthn'']}


  Ensure active recall, spaced repetition friendly, distractors plausible/common errors. No hints on front. Vary difficulty
  progressively by layer.'
