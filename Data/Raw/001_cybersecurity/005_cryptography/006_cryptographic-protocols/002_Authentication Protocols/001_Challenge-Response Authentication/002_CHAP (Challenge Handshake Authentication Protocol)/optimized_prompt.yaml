active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what ways does CHAP mitigate replay attacks compared to simpler password-based protocols like PAP?
    Debate the trade-offs of periodic re-authentication in terms of security vs. performance, using real-world examples from
    PPPoE deployments in ISP networks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Plausible misconceptions: e.g., ''CHAP sends password in cleartext'' (confuses with PAP)'
    - 'Partial truths: e.g., ''MD5 only on challenge'' (omits shared secret)'
    - 'Reversals: e.g., ''Peer sends challenge'' instead of authenticator'
    - 'Outdated info: e.g., ''CHAP uses DES instead of MD5'''
    - 'Edge cases: e.g., ''No periodic re-auth'' (ignores feature)'
    - Generate 3 distractors per MCQ, balanced difficulty

  Use this synthesized content:

  [Insert full scaffolding layers here verbatim].


  Incorporate these learning objectives: [Insert learning_objectives array here].


  Embed active learning: [Insert active_learning here].


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following this schema exactly:

  - Output as JSON array of objects: [{''type'': ''MCQ|Cloze|Short|Scenario'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'':
  ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''active_learning_link'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...''}}]

  - Balance: 30% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 30% APPLY/ANALYZE, 40% EVALUATE/CREATE.

  - Cover all 4 scaffolding layers proportionally.

  - For MCQs: 1 correct + 3 distractors (use distractor protocol: misconceptions like PAP confusion, MD5 details, role reversals).

  - Explanations: 2-4 sentences, tie to objectives/layers, correct misconceptions.

  - Optimize for Anki/spaced repetition: concise fronts, rich backs.

  - Ensure completeness: Full CHAP steps (Challenge→Response→Success/Failure), PPP context, MD5 hash example (e.g., MD5(''secretABC123'')=...).


  Prioritize university pedagogy: Bloom''s progression, active recall. No external sources needed.'
