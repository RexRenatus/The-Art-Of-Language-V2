active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between CRL (Certificate Revocation Lists) and OCSP (Online
    Certificate Status Protocol) for real-time S/MIME certificate revocation checking in high-security environments. Consider
    latency, privacy, and attack vectors like phishing or man-in-the-middle.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Plausible errors: Mix roles (e.g., ''RA issues certs'' instead of verifies), confuse protocols (CRL as real-time vs
      OCSP), swap concepts (PGP web-of-trust for S/MIME PKI), outdated practices (no OCSP mention), enterprise oversights
      (no key escrow).'
    balance: 20% cards MCQ; distractors 1 superficial, 1 conceptual mix-up, 1 advanced misconception.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in S/MIME Certificate Management
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 001_Cryptographic Protocols > 010_Secure Email Protocols > S/MIME >
  S/MIME Certificate Management). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning ideas, scaffolding layers (1-4), and
  flashcard schema to create optimized Anki-style flashcards.


  Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy coverage, active recall via questions, scaffolding progression. Ground
  in research: PKI roles (CA/RA/Subscriber/Relying Party), lifecycle (issuance via CSR/RA validation, installation in Outlook,
  renewal, revocation via CRL/OCSP, key escrow), digital signatures (hash+private key encrypt), standards (CA/B Forum S/MIME
  BR), best practices (HSM, automation), comparisons (vs PGP), big picture (secure email vs phishing/MITM).


  Generate exactly 40 flashcards (10 per scaffolding layer). Use schema: JSON array of objects with ''front'', ''back'' (answer,
  explanation, distractors if MCQ, layer, related_objective), metadata. Balance: 30% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 30% APPLY/ANALYZE,
  40% EVALUATE/CREATE. 20% MCQ with distractors per protocol. Questions active/precise. Explanations link to layers/objectives/sources.
  Output only valid JSON array.'
