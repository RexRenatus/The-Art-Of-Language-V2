However, the 'sp' tag specifically overrides the 'p' tag for subdomains. Therefore, the email should be rejected. Wait, re-reading the prompt, the 'sp' is 'reject' and 'p' is 'quarantine'. The email is from a subdomain and fails DMARC. The 'sp' policy of 'reject' should apply. Therefore, the email should be rejected. Let me re-evaluate. The prompt states <code>p=quarantine</code> and <code>sp=reject</code>. An email from a subdomain fails. The <code>sp</code> policy applies to subdomains. Therefore, the <code>reject</code> policy should be applied. The correct answer should be 'rejected'. My initial reasoning was flawed.
