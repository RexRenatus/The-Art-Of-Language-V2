active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the security trade-offs of using OCSP Responder Certificates versus CRLs in modern PKI deployments.
    Consider replay attacks, privacy implications from query tracking, and standards like RFC 6960 (OCSP improvements) versus
    traditional CRL distribution. Support arguments with real-world examples from HTTPS ecosystems.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  25 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''OCSP Responder Certificates'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography

  Responder Certificates).


  **Prior Knowledge:** Assume learners know X.509 certs, PKI, CRLs.

  **Big Picture:** Enables real-time revocation in HTTPS to block compromised certs.


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s):** [Insert the 6 objectives above].

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert all layer contents above].

  **Active Learning Integration:** Draw from discussion (trade-offs vs CRLs), peer teaching (KU/EKU), problem-solving (openssl
  troubleshooting).


  **Output Format:** JSON array of objects, each: {''type'': ''basic_qa/mcq/true_false'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'':
  ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''1-4'', ''distractors'': [''d1'', ''d2'', ''d3'']
  (for MCQ)}}.


  **Schema Rules:** Balance types (40% basic, 40% MCQ, 20% T/F). 5-7 cards per layer. Distractors: Plausible errors (wrong
  OID, e.g., 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1 for clientAuth; keyEncipherment misuse; ignore nonce DoS). Explanations: Cite RFC 6960/6066/8954,
  OIDs. Ensure university-level rigor, active recall.'
