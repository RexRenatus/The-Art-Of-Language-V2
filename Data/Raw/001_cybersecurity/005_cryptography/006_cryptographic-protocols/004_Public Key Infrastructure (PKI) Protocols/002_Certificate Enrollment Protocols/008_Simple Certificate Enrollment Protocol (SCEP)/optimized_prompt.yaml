active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using SCEP versus EST for device certificate enrollment
    in a large-scale MDM environment (e.g., Apple Configurator or Intune). Consider scalability, security (shared secrets
    vs. CMS/TLS), and legacy support. Support arguments with references to RFC 8894 and real-world vulnerabilities.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    vs. shared secret), 2) Related but wrong protocol (e.g., EST operation), 3) Partial truth (e.g., ''PKCS#10 response''
    vs. PKCS#7). Ensure distractors from research/voter errors like incomplete steps or NDES specifics.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in SCEP (Simple Certificate
  Enrollment Protocol) under topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 001_Cryptography > 001_Cryptographic Protocols > 009_004_Public
  Key Infrastructure (PKI) Protocols > Certificate Enrollment Protocols > Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP). Builds
  on prior PKI/X.509/CSR knowledge.


  Generate 32 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema: Front (question with Bloom''s level), Back (answer, explanation
  w/ RFC 8894 refs & full SCEP steps from voter consensus, bloom_level, scaffolding_layer, active_learning_tie_in).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [paste array above]

  - Scaffolding layers: Distribute cards across 4 layers [paste scaffolding above]

  - Active learning: Tie 20% of cards to exercises [paste active_learning above]

  - Flashcard schema: Follow structure/types/distractors/quantity [paste schema above]


  Ensure completeness: Full SCEP flow (GetCACert > CSR POST to pkiclient.exe > PKCS#7 CertRep/FAILURE/PENDING > GetCertInitial
  polling > renewal). Web context: RFC 8894 (CMS/PKCS#7/10 over HTTP), shared secret risks, NDES/MDM.


  Output ONLY as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'':
  ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': 1, ''active_learning_tie_in'': ''optional''}}]. No extras.'
