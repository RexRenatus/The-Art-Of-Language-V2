        "core_logic": "Establishing trust in the CA certificate is critical. SCEP recommends validating the CA certificate out-of-band (e.g., via pre-shared fingerprint) because the initial communication channel might not yet be fully trusted, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Automatic trust is insecure. While web interfaces can provide certificates, initial trust requires out-of-band validation. Relying solely on well-known roots can be insufficient if the specific CA needs explicit trust.",
        "analogy": "Before trusting a new security guard (CA), you wouldn't just take their word for it. You'd check their ID badge (fingerprint) against a verified list you received beforehand (out-of-band verification)."

        "core_logic": "The original SCEP protocol has limited support for Certificate Revocation List (CRL) retrieval and does not inherently support online certificate status protocols like OCSP. Its design focuses on enrollment, with revocation typically handled offline or via separate mechanisms like CDPs.",
        "distractor_analysis": "SCEP is fundamentally an HTTP-based request/response protocol using PKCS#10, and it supports asynchronous operations where the server processes requests and clients poll for results.",
        "analogy": "SCEP is like ordering a custom-made item. You place your order (request), and the maker works on it (asynchronous granting). You don't get instant confirmation of its status like you might with a real-time check (OCSP)."

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Using HTTPS (HTTP over TLS/SSL) for SCEP transport encrypts the communication channel, protecting the confidentiality and integrity of the enrollment requests and responses. This prevents eavesdropping and tampering, which is crucial for sensitive PKI operations.",
        "distractor_analysis": "HTTPS secures the transport but does not inherently remove the need for SCEP's challenge password, nor does it force the use of specific algorithms within SCEP itself. It also doesn't add certificate revocation functionality to SCEP.",
