active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains the MISP event structure (e.g., attributes, objects, tags) using a sample
    JSON snippet. The partner then teaches back the equivalent STIX structure (e.g., Indicator SDO with Observable SCO). Switch
    roles and validate mappings using official documentation.
  problem_solving: 'Given a raw IoC in CSV format (e.g., IP: 192.168.1.1, type: malicious, context: C2 server), translate
    it to both MISP and STIX formats. Validate using online tools like MISP workbench or STIX validator, then discuss automation
    needs (e.g., scripts or misp2stix) for threat hunting pipelines.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university pedagogy (Bloom''s
  Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized flashcards for the topic ''Format
  Translation'' in Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Types > 003_Threat Intelligence Lifecycle
  > Processing and Normalization > Format Translation.


  Incorporate these learning objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE].

  Include active learning tie-ins where relevant in explanations (e.g., ''Discussed in peer teaching activity'').

  Structure content across 4 scaffolding layers: [INSERT scaffolding OBJECT HERE].

  Use research context: Format translation enables TI interoperability (IoCs, TTPs); key formats MISP (JSON events/attributes),
  STIX 2.x (SDOs/SCOs/Bundles), TAXII (transport), OpenIOC (XML), OTX (JSON); tools like misp2stix; TI lifecycle processing.


  Output exactly a JSON array of 25-35 flashcards, each following this strict schema: [INSERT flashcard_schema.fields HERE].
  Ensure variety: 40% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND (basic/cloze), 30% APPLY/ANALYZE (mcq), 30% EVALUATE/CREATE (scenario-based). Distractors
  must be plausible per protocol. Front prompts encourage active recall. Explanations link to objectives/layers/real-world
  use (e.g., SOAR integration). No additional text outside the JSON array.'
