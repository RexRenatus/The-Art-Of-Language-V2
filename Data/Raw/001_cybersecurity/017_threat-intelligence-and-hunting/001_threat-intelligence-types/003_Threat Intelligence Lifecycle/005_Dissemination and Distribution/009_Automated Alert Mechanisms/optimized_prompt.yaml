  Use this content:

  [Insert full scaffolding_layers content here, including definitions, frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK, STIX/TAXII), implementation
  (Splunk/ELK steps), integration (ML, NIST, best practices: tuning/fatigue reduction/testing/interoperability), sources,
  voter suggestions, research context].


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [Insert full learning_objectives array].

  - Active learning for context: [Insert active_learning_components summaries].


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards following the exact schema:

  {front, back: {answer, explanation, distractors_analysis}, metadata: {bloom_level, scaffolding_layer, tags, type}}.


  Rules:

  - Cover all Bloom''s levels and layers progressively.

  - 40% MCQs with 4 options (1 correct, 3 distractors per protocol).

  - Include active learning ties (e.g., cards on SolarWinds scenario).

  - Explanations: 2-4 sentences, pedagogical (link to objectives/layers), reference sources.

  - Optimize for Anki/Quizlet: Clear, concise, spaced repetition-friendly.

  - Ensure factual accuracy, no fabrication.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 30 flashcards.'
