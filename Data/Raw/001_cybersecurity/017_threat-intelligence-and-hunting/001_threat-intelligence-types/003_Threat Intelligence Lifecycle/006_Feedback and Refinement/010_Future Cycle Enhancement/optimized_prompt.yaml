  peer_teaching: 'Pair up and peer-teach: One student explains one CTI type (e.g., tactical intelligence) and its role in
    the feedback/refinement stage; the partner summarizes and quizzes back using a think-pair-share on how it enhances future
    cycles.'
  problem_solving: 'In teams, solve: ''Design a feedback system for a simulated ransomware breach using the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
    Identify gaps in the current TI lifecycle, propose refinements, and outline enhancements for the next cycle, incorporating
    GenAI for automated hypothesis generation.'''
