active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the limitations of relying solely on MITRE ATT&CK for attack mechanism
    documentation versus combining it with custom organizational TTPs. Provide evidence from real-world threat reports and
    propose hybrid solutions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Partial truth (e.g., related but wrong tactic), 3. Out-of-scope (e.g., unrelated framework). Ensure distractors promote
    critical thinking and avoid randomness.'
