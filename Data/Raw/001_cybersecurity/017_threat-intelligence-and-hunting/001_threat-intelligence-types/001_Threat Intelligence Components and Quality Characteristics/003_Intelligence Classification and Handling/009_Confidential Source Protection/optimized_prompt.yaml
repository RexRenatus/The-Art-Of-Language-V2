  **Complete Research Context (Synthesized and Expanded):**

  - **CHS Definition**: Individual providing credible info to agencies (e.g., FBI) for authorized activities; identity/relationship
  requires confidential handling. (DOJ Attorney General''s Guidelines).

  - **Role in Cyber Threat Intel/Hunting**: CHS supply TTPs, actor motives for proactive hunting.

  - **Key Principles**: Confidentiality, validation (suitability: background/motivations; credibility: accuracy tests; value:
  intel utility), authorization (including limited illegal acts if justified).

  - **Attorney General''s Guidelines (DOJ/FBI, 2015)**: Purpose: Standardize CHS use; Scope: FBI ops (principles broad for
  cyber); Sections: Recruitment, Validation/Authorization, Operations/Handling, Protection (secure comms, need-to-know), Deactivation,
  Oversight. U.S.-specific but applicable to private sector.

  - **Industry Standards**: Aligns with NIST SP 800-150 (Intel Sharing), MITRE ATT&CK (TTP integration); Best Practices: Compartmentalization,
  polygraph if needed, risk assessments.

  - **Real-World Case Studies**: FBI CHS compromises in APT28 (Russia) ops led to source exposure (2018 indictments); Hypothetical:
  CHS in ransomware gang leaks TTPs—protocol failure risks actor retaliation.

  **Learning Objectives**: [Insert the full learning_objectives array here].

  **Active Learning**: Incorporate ties to [discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving] in explanations.

  **Scaffolding**: Distribute cards across 4 layers: [Insert scaffolding_layers here].


  **Flashcard Generation Instructions**:

  - Use exact schema: 50% basic Q/A, 50% MCQ (4 options, 1 correct).

  - Distractor Protocol: Plausible, misconception-based (e.g., ''Validation skips ethics'' as distractor).

  - Each card: Front, Back (answer), Explanation (pedagogical tie-in, 2-4 sentences), bloom_level, layer, tags (3-5 keywords).

  - Ensure accuracy: U.S.-focused but note broad principles; no illegal advice.

  - Output as JSON array of objects, e.g., [{''type'': ''mcq'', ''front'': ''...'', ...}]. Generate 45 flashcards, balanced
  by layer/Bloom''s.
