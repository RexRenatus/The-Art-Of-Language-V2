      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Effective compartmentalization involves a multi-faceted approach. This includes defining clear access policies based on 'need-to-know', implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to enforce these policies, and leveraging standards like STIX for structured representation and TAXII for secure, controlled exchange. NIST guidance (e.g., SP 800-37) reinforces the importance of risk management and layered security, which compartmentalization directly supports.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The first distractor incorrectly pairs encryption with open sharing. The second oversimplifies security to just firewalls. The third promotes open access, which is contrary to compartmentalization.",
        "analogy": "Implementing compartmentalization is like designing a secure building: you need clear access policies (who can go where), role-based access cards (RBAC), secure doors and elevators (firewalls/TAXII), and standardized blueprints (STIX) for different sections."
