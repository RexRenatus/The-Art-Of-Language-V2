  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Proactive Threat Hunting is more valuable to a SOC than
    traditional TI based on IOCs in modern cyber threats.'' Support your position with examples from TTPs and real-world breaches,
    considering adversary adaptability.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  \ Types → Level 4: 001_Threat Intelligence Components and Quality Characteristics → Level 5: Intelligence Functions → Level\
  \ 6: SOC Activity Enhancement.\n\nIncorporate these learning objectives (span Bloom's Taxonomy):\n- Remember: Recall definitions\
  \ of SOC, TI, Hunting, IOCs, TTPs.\n- Understand: Explain TI functions in SOC.\n- Apply: Use TI in scenarios.\n- Analyze:\
  \ Differentiate IOCs/TTPs vs reactive/proactive.\n- Evaluate: Assess TI quality in SOC.\n- Create: Design enhancement strategies.\n\
  \nUse scaffolding layers progressively:\n1. Foundation: Basic terms.\n2. Components: Functions, IOCs/TTPs.\n3. Implementation:\
  \ SOC application.\n4. Integration: Advanced SOC enhancement.\n\nEmbed active learning hooks (discussion, peer teaching,\
  \ problem-solving) in explanations.\n\nResearch context: SOC monitors/detects/responds (mitre.org). TI provides adversary\
  \ insights. Hunting seeks hidden threats (hunt.io). IOCs are artifacts; TTPs are behaviors.\n\nGenerate 20-30 flashcards\
