active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how preventative intelligence support transforms traditional SOC operations
    from reactive incident response to proactive threat disruption. Provide examples using MITRE ATT&CK and Cyber Kill Chain,
    and evaluate potential challenges in implementation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., reactive focus), 1 unrelated but plausible (e.g., wrong framework). Ensure distractors test analysis/evaluation.
    Balance question types: 30% remember, 30% understand/apply, 40% analyze/evaluate/create.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on
  ''Preventative Intelligence Support'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence
  Types > 001_Threat Intelligence Components and Quality Characteristics > Intelligence Functions > Preventative Intelligence
  Support).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list from above]

  - Scaffolding: Prior knowledge from TI components; 4 layers as defined [insert scaffolding details]; concept map [insert
  textual map]; big picture context.

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving (e.g., scenario Qs).

  - Research Context: Proactive TI for threat anticipation; definitions of TI, hunting, preventative intel, IOCs/IOAs/TTPs;
  frameworks: MITRE ATT&CK, full Cyber Kill Chain (Recon, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, C2, Actions);
  SOC/SIEM integration.


  Use exact Flashcard Schema: JSON array of objects with ''front'' and ''back'' (answer, explanation, distractors for MCQ,
  hints, source_links). Vary types per distractor protocol. Span Bloom''s levels evenly across layers. Ensure completeness
  (e.g., full Kill Chain) and voter priorities (e.g., prereqs, cross-links). Output only valid JSON array.'
