  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1. Common misconception (e.g., confuse SDO with SCO), 2.
    Related but incorrect term (e.g., TAXII instead of STIX), 3. Partial truth (e.g., outdated STIX v1.x feature). Ensure
    distractors are realistic based on web research (OASIS STIX docs) and avoid randomness—tie to voter suggestions/errors.'
