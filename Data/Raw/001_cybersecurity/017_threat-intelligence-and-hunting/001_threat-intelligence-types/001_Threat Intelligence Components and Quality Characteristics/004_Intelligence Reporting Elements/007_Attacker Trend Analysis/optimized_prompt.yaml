  - objective: Apply knowledge to scenarios
    verbs:
    - apply

  understand:
  - objective: Explain core concepts
    verbs:
    - explain
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In groups of 3-4, discuss a recent real-world cyber incident (e.g., a ransomware campaign). Analyze how
    changes in the attackers' TTPs reflect broader trends, predict potential future adaptations, and debate the role of IoAs
    vs. IoCs in early detection. Share one key insight with the class.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Attacker Trend Analysis''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Level 1: Cybersecurity > Level 2: Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Level 3: Threat Intelligence Types
  > Level 4: 001_Threat Intelligence Components and Quality Characteristics > Level 5: Intelligence Reporting Elements > Level
  6: Attacker Trend Analysis). Use the provided research context: Attacker trend analysis identifies evolving threat actor
  TTPs using IoCs/IoAs, Cyber Kill Chain, MITRE ATT&CK, threat intelligence, and hunting.


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives: [insert learning_objectives array here]

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers [insert scaffolding_layers here]. Aim for 20-30% per layer.

  - Active learning tie-ins: Questions should prompt application/discussion (e.g., ''How would you...'').

  - Best practices: Active recall, spaced repetition, varied formats (50% Q/A, 50% MCQ).


  Generate 40 high-quality flashcards (10 per scaffolding layer). Follow exact schema:

  [insert flashcard_schema here]


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''layer'':1, ''bloom_level'':''Remember'', ''front'':''...'', ''back'':{''answer'':''...'',
  ''explanation'':''...'', ''distractors'':[''A: why wrong'', ...], ''hints'':[''...'']}}, ...]. Ensure web-grounded accuracy
  from context (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK as TTP knowledge base). No extra text.'
