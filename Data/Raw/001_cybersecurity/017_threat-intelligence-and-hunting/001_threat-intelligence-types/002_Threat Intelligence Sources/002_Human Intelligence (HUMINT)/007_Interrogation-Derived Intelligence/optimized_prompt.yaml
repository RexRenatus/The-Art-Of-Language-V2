  **Content Foundation (Complete Research Context, per voter priorities):** Interrogation-Derived Intelligence: Info from
  questioning individuals (e.g., captured cyber actors, insiders) on threats/vulnerabilities. Emphasize voluntary, rapport-based
  (FBI HIG: High-Value Interrogation Group, national security origin—science-informed, non-coercive; key takeaways: Build
  trust for accurate intel, avoid false confessions, comply with laws like Miranda). Elicitation: Subtle questioning. Cyber
  apps: Enhance threat hunting (TTPs to SIEM queries). Ethics/Legal: Voluntary only, no coercion; distinguish from law enforcement.
  Sources: FBI HIG Report (2016), ''Effective Interviewing of Suspects'' (DoD), SANS ''Threat Intelligence Frameworks'', MITRE
  ATT&CK (HUMINT examples).


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Use provided learning_objectives (Bloom''s), active_learning_components (inspire scenario cards),
  scaffolding_layers (tag each card). Add formative assessments (e.g., quizzes on ethics).


  **Output Format (Strict JSON Array):** [{''front'': ''Question'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...
  (cite sources, ethics)'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''A'', ''B'', ''C'']}},
  ...]. Follow flashcard_generation_schema exactly: Distractors for MCQs, variety, distribution. Ensure clarity (define acronyms),
  conciseness, accuracy (no coercion promotion), practical cyber examples.'
