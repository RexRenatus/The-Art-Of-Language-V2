    - explain
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the pros and cons of relying on security blogs for OSINT (e.g., real-time insights from CrowdStrike
    on novel TTPs) versus structured frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK or NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Provide examples of TTPs
    from blogs and evaluate their impact on threat hunting effectiveness.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2. Partial truths (e.g., outdated blog examples). 3. Related but incorrect concepts (e.g., mix MITRE ATT&CK with NIST
    CSF). Ensure distractors are realistic from research context (e.g., Bitsight, Cynet sources) and voter-completed content.'

  Incorporate these learning objectives [INSERT FULL LIST ABOVE]. Ensure cards progress Bloom''s levels: 10 REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND,
  15 APPLY/ANALYZE, 15 EVALUATE, 10 CREATE.


  Use 4-layer scaffolding [INSERT FULL LAYERS ABOVE]: Distribute cards: 15 Layer 1, 15 Layer 2, 10 Layer 3, 10 Layer 4.


  Embed active learning hooks: Reference discussion debates, peer teaching summaries, problem-solving hunts in explanations.


  Key content from research: Threat Intelligence (TI), Cyber Threat Hunting, IOCs (e.g., unusual DNS), IOAs (e.g., covert
  comms), TTPs (MITRE ATT&CK), Malware-Free Attacks. Sources: CrowdStrike, Mandiant, Krebs, Bitsight.com, Cynet.com, Heimdalsecurity.com.
  NIST Cybersecurity Framework: Used for validation (e.g., Identify/Protect functions). Real examples: CrowdStrike blog pivots.
