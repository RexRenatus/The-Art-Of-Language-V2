active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the pros and cons of relying on news report aggregation for OSINT in threat intelligence. How
    does it compare to social media or forums? Consider risks like misinformation, timeliness, and verification challenges.
    (Encourages critical thinking on source reliability and ties to EVALUATE level.)
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Topic: News Report Aggregation (Hierarchy:

  **Full Research Context (Completed):** News report aggregation systematically collects/processes news for CTI in threat
  hunting. Key concepts: CTI (threat knowledge), Threat Hunting (proactive searches), OSINT subset via news. Extract IoCs
  (IPs, hashes), TTPs. Frameworks: STIX 2.1 (OASIS: https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro.html), TAXII
  2.1 (exchange: https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/taxii/intro.html), MITRE ATT&CK (ttps: https://attack.mitre.org/)
  - e.g., map SolarWinds news (C2 domains) to Tactic TA0001 Initial Access, Technique T1190. Process: Collect (RSS/Google
  News), Process (NLP like spaCy), Analyze (bias check), Integrate (SIEM feeds). Risks: Misinfo. Sources: MITRE ATT&CK, OASIS
  STIX/TAXII, SANS OSINT, Recorded Future reports.
