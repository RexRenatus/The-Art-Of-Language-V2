        "core_logic": "The 'Develop Capabilities: Exploits' technique (T1587.004) focuses on adversaries creating their own exploits, often by uncovering vulnerabilities through methods like fuzzing or patch analysis, rather than simply acquiring pre-existing ones. This is because developing custom exploits allows for tailored targeting and potentially greater exclusivity.",

        "analogy": "Think of it like a chef developing a new recipe from scratch (developing an exploit) versus buying a pre-made meal from a restaurant (acquiring an exploit)."
