active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges (e.g., trust issues, data sensitivity) versus benefits (e.g.,
    collective defense) of cross-sector intelligence exchange. Use real-world examples like ransomware attacks spanning finance
    and healthcare sectors to support your arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
