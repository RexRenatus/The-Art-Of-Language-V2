active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of automated indicator sharing via AIS compared to manual
    methods. Consider privacy risks, speed of response, and scalability for non-government entities. Reference real-world
    examples like phishing campaigns.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Use partial truths (e.g., for STIX: ''XML format'' instead of JSON/2.x)'
    - 'Include plausible alternatives (e.g., for TAXII: ''HTTP, STIX, REST'')'
    - Avoid randomness; tie to voter suggestions (e.g., invalid IOC types)

  Generate 25 high-quality Anki-style flashcards optimized for university pedagogy (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding).
  Cover these exact learning objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]. Incorporate active learning elements (e.g.,
  scenario prompts) and 4 scaffolding layers: [INSERT scaffolding ARRAY HERE]. Use research context: AIS enables machine-to-machine
  CTI/IOC sharing via STIX (structure) and TAXII (transport); includes scoring, TLP; open to non-gov; best practices from
  CISA (https://www.cisa.gov/ais, AIS 2.0 STIX Profile). Address voter priorities: completeness (structured submissions, TLP,
  scoring), misconceptions, prerequisites (CTI/IOCs), concept map (AIS central: STIX/TAXII/IOCs/TLP).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each matching this schema: [INSERT flashcard_schema.structure HERE]. Ensure 40%
  MCQ with distractors per protocol: [INSERT flashcard_schema.distractor_protocol HERE]. Balance: 4-5 per Bloom''s level/layer.
  Explanations must reference objectives, layers, and sources for spaced repetition reinforcement.'
