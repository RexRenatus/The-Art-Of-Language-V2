active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a resource-constrained organization, debate whether CVSS score or presence in CISA KEV should take
    priority for patching—use specific CVEs like Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) and EternalBlue (CVE-2017-0144) as evidence. Support
    arguments with real-world impacts and threat intelligence workflows.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Partial truth (e.g., outdated CVSS version), 3) Related but incorrect term (e.g., mix KEV with NVD). Ensure distractors
    are web-grounded (e.g., real but non-matching CVEs) and promote critical thinking.'

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: Use for context in explanations (e.g., reference discussion on CVSS vs KEV).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers (tag each with Layer 1-4).

  - Prior Knowledge: Link to CIA triad, attack vectors.

  - Real Examples: Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228), EternalBlue (CVE-2017-0144), recent NVD CVEs.

  - Big Picture: CVE''s role in threat hunting, vuln mgmt, SIEM.

  - Sources: cve.mitre.org, nvd.nist.gov, cisa.gov/KEV.


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards (10 per major Bloom''s level: Remember/Understand, Apply/Analyze, Evaluate/Create).
  Use exact Flashcard Schema:

  Output ONLY in JSON array: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''layer'': 1-4, ''blooms_level'':
  ''...''}]. Ensure variety, no repetition, distractors per protocol, and alignment to voter priorities (e.g., API querying,
  prioritization exercises).'
