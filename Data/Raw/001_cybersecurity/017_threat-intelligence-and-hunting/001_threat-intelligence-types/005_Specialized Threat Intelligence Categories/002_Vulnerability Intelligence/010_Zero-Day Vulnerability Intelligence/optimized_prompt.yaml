active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Should organizations prioritize disclosing zero-day vulnerabilities to vendors or retain them for defensive
    purposes? Debate using real-world examples like Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) or SolarWinds Orion supply chain attack, weighing
    ethical, legal, and strategic factors.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions: 1) Confuse with known vulns
    (e.g., ''patched but exploited''), 2) Mix standards (e.g., TAXII as language vs. protocol), 3) Overgeneralize (e.g., ''only
    hardware''). Ensure distractors teach by explaining errors. Examples: What defines zero-day? A) Known but unpatched (distractor),
    B) Unknown to vendor, no patch (correct), C) Patched but exploited (distractor), D) Hardware only (distractor).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards
  for ''Zero-Day Vulnerability Intelligence'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence
  Types > 005_Specialized Threat Intelligence Categories > Vulnerability Intelligence > Zero-Day Vulnerability Intelligence).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives: [insert full learning_objectives array here].

  - Active learning: Cover discussion (disclosure ethics, Log4Shell/SolarWinds), peer teaching (STIX/TAXII vs ATT&CK), problem-solving
  (EternalBlue scenario).

  - Scaffolding: Strictly layer content as [insert full scaffolding array here]. Include prior knowledge (CVEs, threat intel
  basics), concept map (Zero-Day Vuln Intel → Definitions → Standards (STIX: machine-readable threat lang; TAXII: sharing
  protocol) → Frameworks (ATT&CK: TTPs for novel exploits) → Threat Hunting).

  - Research context: Zero-day vuln (unknown to vendor, no patch); exploit/attack; threat intel/hunting; complete best practices
  (collect/analyze/share via STIX/TAXII/ATT&CK; integrate SIEM/SOAR/ML).


  Follow flashcard schema exactly: [insert full flashcard_schema here]. Output as JSON array of flashcards, each with ''type'',
  ''front'', ''back'' (structured object), ''bloom_level'', ''scaffolding_layer'', ''tags'' (e.g., [''STIX'', ''EternalBlue'']).
  Ensure explanations reference objectives, examples, and misconceptions. Balance coverage: 25% foundation, 25% components,
  25% implementation, 25% integration. Make engaging, precise, and educational for university-level learners.'
