  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Patch intelligence is more critical than vulnerability
    intelligence in preventing ransomware attacks like WannaCry.'' Support your position with evidence from NIST frameworks
    and real-world impacts, considering organizational constraints like patch testing downtime.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors from: 1) Partial truths (e.g., ''Patch intelligence only tracks CVEs'' vs. full
    actionable intel). 2) Common errors (e.g., mix NIST SP 800-40 with irrelevant standards). 3) Edge cases (e.g., non-security
    patches). Ensure 60% stem from voter/research misconceptions; balance difficulty (1 easy, 2 medium).'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Patch Intelligence (Topic\
  \ Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Types > 005_Specialized Threat Intelligence\
  \ Categories > Vulnerability Intelligence > Patch Intelligence). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning components,\
  \ scaffolding layers, and flashcard schema to create 50 high-quality flashcards (10-15 per Bloom's pair: Remember/Understand,\
  \ Apply/Analyze, Evaluate/Create; distributed across 4 scaffolding layers).\n\nIncorporate:\n- Voter consensus: Real-world\
  \ cases (WannaCry), NIST SP 800-40 Rev. 4 full details (planning/acquisition/testing/distribution/verification), prior knowledge\
  \ links to CVEs/patch mgmt.\n- Research context: Definitions (patch, vulnerability, etc.), cyber hygiene, Zero Trust, NIST\
  \ SP 1800-31.\n- Pedagogy: Progress from foundation to integration; ensure active recall.\n\nOutput ONLY a JSON array of\
