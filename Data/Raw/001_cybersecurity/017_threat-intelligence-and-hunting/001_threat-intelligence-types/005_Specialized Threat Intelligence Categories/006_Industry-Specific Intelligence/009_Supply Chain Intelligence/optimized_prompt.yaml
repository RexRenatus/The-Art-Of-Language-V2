  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the question: ''How could supply chain intelligence practices have prevented
    or mitigated the SolarWinds supply chain attack? Use evidence from NIST SP 800-161 and compare to traditional threat intelligence
    approaches.'' Encourage critical thinking by requiring participants to reference specific risks, TTPs, and measurable
    outcomes.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Common misconception (e.g., ''Supply chain risks only affect hardware''); (3) Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g.,
    based on SolarWinds but ignoring cascading impacts). Ensure distractors are plausible from research context/voter suggestions,
    forcing analytical thinking.'

  Incorporate this comprehensive content: Supply chain intelligence focuses on risks from suppliers/partners (ecosystem: acquirers,
  suppliers, integrators); SCRM vs C-SCRM; risks (malicious code, counterfeits, etc.); standards (NIST SP 800-161 Rev. 1:
  C-SCRM practices for systems/organizations; NISTIR 8276: Supply chain risk info; CISA guidance on third-party risks); cases
  (SolarWinds: Orion backdoor; Kaseya: VSA exploit). Sources: NIST SP 800-161 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-161r1),
  NISTIR 8276 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8276), CISA Supply Chain (cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/supply-chain-security).
