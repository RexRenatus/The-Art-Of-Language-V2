  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: Use for contextual explanations.

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste the scaffolding_layers array here] – Distribute cards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer
  3, 25% Layer 4.

  - Prerequisites/Big Picture/Concept Map: As in layers.

  - Examples: Anonymous (Scientology DDoS), LulzSec leaks, tools (Maltego, Shodan).

  - Sources: MITRE ATT&CK, Huntress.com, mitre.org.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: Mix Basic Q/A (20%), Cloze (30%), MCQ (50%). Use distractor protocol strictly. Each card
  MUST include: Explanation (link to Bloom objective, source), Tags (full hierarchy path).

  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''tags'': [''...'']}, ...]. Ensure variety, no duplicates, progressive difficulty (Layer 1 easy → Layer 4 complex).'
