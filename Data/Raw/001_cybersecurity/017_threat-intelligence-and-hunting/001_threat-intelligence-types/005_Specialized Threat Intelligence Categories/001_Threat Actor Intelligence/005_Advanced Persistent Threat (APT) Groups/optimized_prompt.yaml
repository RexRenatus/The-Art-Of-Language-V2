active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a forum or group discussion, debate the attribution challenges of APT groups like APT41 (China) versus
    Lazarus Group (North Korea). How do overlapping TTPs complicate intelligence analysis, and what role does geopolitical
    context play? Support your arguments with examples from MITRE ATT&CK.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Similar but incorrect group/TTP (e.g., Lazarus for APT28); 3) Partial truth (e.g., wrong nation-state). Base on real
    variations from MITRE/research to avoid implausibility.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Advanced Persistent Threat
  (APT) Groups under the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Types > 005_Specialized
  Threat Intelligence Categories > Threat Actor Intelligence > Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Groups.


  Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema. Incorporate university pedagogy: progress through Bloom''s
  Taxonomy via these objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]. Use active learning hooks (e.g., scenario prompts
  from discussion/problem-solving). Scaffold across 4 layers: [INSERT scaffolding_layers ARRAY HERE].


  Content must be web-grounded: APTs are sophisticated/persistent/stealthy/targeted (safateam.com); TTPs stable vs. IOCs (MITRE
  ATT&CK); examples: APT28/Fancy Bear (Russia, spearphishing), APT29/Cozy Bear (Russia, espionage), Lazarus (North Korea,
  financial), APT41 (China, dual-motives). Link to prior knowledge (basic threats). Voter consensus (82.9%): Emphasize examples,
  hunting steps, MITRE integration.


  Follow flashcard schema exactly: [INSERT flashcard_schema HERE]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects. Ensure distractors
  are realistic. Balance: 20% lower Bloom''s (Layers 1-2), 80% higher (Layers 3-4). Make explanations educational for spaced
  repetition.'
