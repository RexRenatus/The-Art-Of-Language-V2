active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given rising geopolitical tensions, debate whether organizations should restrict travel to high-risk
    areas or invest in enhanced TSI monitoring. Use real-world examples like recent civil unrest in Ukraine or Sudan to support
    your position. Address misconceptions that TSI is only reactive rather than proactive.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains 'geopolitical vs. physical security threats' with examples/non-examples (e.g.,
    terrorism as both, theft as purely physical), then engages in a 'teach-back' where the partner quizzes them. Switch roles
    to reinforce understanding.
  problem_solving: In groups, assess risks for a fictional executive trip to a high-risk destination (e.g., Yemen based on
    current events). Create a mitigation plan including TSI tools (OSINT monitoring), cyber precautions (VPN usage), and contingency
    plans. Present findings for peer-review and feedback.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (40% of cards), generate 3 plausible distractors: (1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''TSI
    only covers cyber risks'' vs. physical); (2) Confusable similar concepts (e.g., mix ISO 31000 principles with ISO 27001
    controls); (3) Partial truths or outdated info (e.g., ignoring integration with NIST). Ensure distractors are realistic
    based on voter-noted errors like underemphasizing cyber in physical TSI.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using Bloom''s Taxonomy, active
  learning, and scaffolding for optimal retention. Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Travel Security Intelligence''

  CONTENT SUMMARY (web-grounded research + voter enhancements):

  Travel Security Intelligence (TSI) proactively collects/analyzes info on travel risks: geopolitical (instability, terrorism),
  physical (crime, kidnapping), health (diseases), cyber (Wi-Fi phishing). Traveler Risk Management: pre/in/post-travel processes.
  Frameworks: ISO 31000:2018 (risk mgmt principles/process), ISO 27001:2013 (ISMS with A.11 physical security/travel policies,
  A.18 compliance), NIST SP 800-30 (risk assessment), NISTIR 8401 (cyber-travel). Big Picture: Integrates physical/digital
  TI for enterprise risk mgmt. Prior Knowledge: Builds on OSINT/risk assessment from Threat Intelligence Types.


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the learning_objectives array here]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste the scaffolding array here]

  - Active Learning Context: Use scenarios from discussion/peer-teaching/problem-solving for applied cards (e.g., exec trip
  to high-risk area).


  Generate exactly 28 flashcards following the exact schema: [paste flashcard_schema.structure, distractor_protocol, requirements
  here]. Balance coverage: 7 cards per scaffolding layer, spanning all Bloom''s levels. Ensure explanations reference sources/frameworks/voter
  priorities (e.g., complete ISO 27001 details). Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, no additional text.'
