active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between proactive surveillance of executives' digital footprints for threat intelligence
    and potential privacy violations. Use real-world examples like celebrity doxxing or political figures under threat (e.g.,
    hacked social media leading to physical stalking) to argue for or against expanded monitoring. Consider ethical, legal,
    and effectiveness factors.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs: 1 correct answer + 3 plausible distractors. Distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g.,
    ''Executive protection is only physical security'' vs. ''Integrates cyber intel''), partial truths (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK
    Tactic: ''Reconnaissance'' vs. distractors like ''Execution'' or ''Persistence''), or edge cases (e.g., privacy overreach
    examples). Ensure distractors are realistic from research context (e.g., nisos.com on PII risks).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education. Create 40-50 high-quality Anki
  flashcards for the topic ''Executive Protection Intelligence'' (Category: Cybersecurity; Domain: Threat Intelligence And
  Hunting; Subdomain: Threat Intelligence Types; Entry: 005_Specialized Threat Intelligence Categories > 004_Physical Security
  Intelligence; Level 6 topic). Use the provided research context, hierarchy, and pedagogical elements for accuracy and depth.


  **Research Context Summary:** Executive Protection Intelligence safeguards executives/VIPs from physical/cyber/reputational
  threats via threat intel collection/analysis. Key concepts: PII, digital footprint, threat hunting. Frameworks: MITRE ATT&CK
  (e.g., Reconnaissance via OSINT), Cyber Kill Chain. SANS Institute: Offers FOR578 Threat Hunting and GIAC certs integrating
  exec protection. Sources: [nisos.com], [recordedfuture.com], [mitre.org/attack], [sans.org].


  **Incorporate Learning Objectives:** [insert full list from JSON]. Ensure flashcards target these levels progressively.


  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Weave in discussion debates (privacy vs. surveillance), peer teaching (MITRE/PII), problem-solving
  (leaked itinerary hunts) via scenario-based cards.


  **Scaffolding:** Distribute cards across 4 layers: [insert full scaffolding from JSON]. Tag cards with layer.


  **Flashcard Output Format (JSON array):** [{''front'': ''Question/MCQ'', ''back'': ''Answer | Explanation | Bloom: Level
  | Layer: X | Source: Y''}, ...]. Follow schema exactly: Mix Q&A/MCQs, distractor protocol for MCQs, detailed explanations.


  **Best Practices:** University pedagogy (Bloom''s, active recall); plausible distractors; no spoilers; scaffold from foundation
  to integration; reference prior knowledge (Threat Intelligence Types, Physical Security). Output only the JSON array of
  flashcards.'
