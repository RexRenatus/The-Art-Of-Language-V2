Because adversaries can easily switch IP addresses or use legitimate-looking cloud infrastructure, relying solely on IP-based IoCs can result in false positives (if an IP is reassigned) or false negatives (if the adversary uses a new IP). Therefore, context and correlation with other IoCs are crucial.",
