active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of adopting OASIS-standardized STIX/TAXII for threat
    intelligence sharing versus using proprietary or ad-hoc formats. Consider factors like interoperability, implementation
    cost, and scalability in real-world threat hunting operations. Support arguments with examples from OASIS documentation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Context:**

  - Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Types > 008_Threat Intelligence
  Sharing Standards and Formats > STIX > OASIS Standardization.

  - Voter Consensus (100%): Emphasize TAXII completion (purpose: transport STIX via APIs; versions 2.1; relation: STIX content
  + TAXII transport), JSON examples, prior knowledge (threat actors/IOCs, JSON).

  - Research: OASIS CTI TC standardizes STIX (JSON-serialized CTI language) & TAXII (REST APIs). Sources: https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/cti/charter.php,
  https://oasis-open.org/2021/06/23/stix-v2-1-and-taxii-v2-1-oasis-standards-are-published, https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/.


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the 6 objectives above].

  - Scaffolding: Generate 12-13 cards per layer (Layer 1: Foundation, etc.) [Insert scaffolding details].

  - Active Learning: Infuse prompts referencing discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving [Insert active learning details].


  **Generate 50 flashcards using the exact schema:**

  [Insert full flashcard_schema here].

  Balance: Cover all objectives/layers; 60% MCQ w/ distractors; include 5+ JSON parsing examples.

  Output ONLY as JSON array: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}}, ...]. No extra text.'
