active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs of MISP-STIX conversion in multi-vendor threat sharing environments. When might
    data fidelity be lost (e.g., complex MISP galaxies to STIX relationships), and how can it be mitigated (e.g., custom mappings,
    validation scripts)? Provide examples from real-world breaches like SolarWinds.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Ensure no giveaways; test for 70-80% first-try success rate
