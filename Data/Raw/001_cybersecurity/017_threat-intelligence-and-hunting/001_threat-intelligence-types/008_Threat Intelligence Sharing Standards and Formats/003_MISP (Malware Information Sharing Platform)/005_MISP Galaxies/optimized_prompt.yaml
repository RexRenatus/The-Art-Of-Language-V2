active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages of MISP Galaxies over traditional flat IOC sharing for collaborative
    threat intelligence. How do relationships between clusters enhance threat actor profiling in hunting scenarios? Provide
    examples from real-world APT campaigns.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education on ''MISP Galaxies'' (Topic Hierarchy: [''Cybersecurity'',
  ''Threat Intelligence And Hunting'', ''Threat Intelligence Types'', ''008_Threat Intelligence Sharing Standards and Formats'',
  ''MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform)'', ''MISP Galaxies'']). Use the provided Learning Objectives, Active Learning
  activities, Scaffolding layers, and completed Research Context to generate 20-30 high-quality flashcards spanning all Bloom''s
  levels (at least 3-5 per level, progressing from REMEMBER to CREATE).


  **Completed Research Context:** MISP Galaxies represent a structured approach... [full original + completion: MISP Galaxies
  can be serialized in JSON and imported/exported in MISP. They align with STIX principles but are optimized for MISP''s attribute
  model, enabling rich relationships beyond STIX''s basic objects. Sources: https://github.com/MISP/misp-galaxy, https://www.misp-project.org/features.html,
  https://attack.mitre.org/, MISP Documentation (misp-project.org), STIX 2.1 RFC. Examples: Sofacy JSON - {''uuid'': ''...'',
  ''name'': ''Sofacy Group'', ''description'': ''APT28'', ''meta'': {''country'': ''RU'', ''synonym'': [''Fancy Bear'']},
  ''refs'': [{''url'': ''https://...''}], ''relationships'': [{''cluster'': ''Loki RAT'', ''type'': ''uses''}, {''cluster'':
  ''T1204.002'', ''type'': ''uses-technique''}]}; ATT&CK Galaxy integration for TTP mapping.]


  **Instructions:**

  - Draw from Prior Knowledge (MISP Events/Attributes/IOCs), Big Picture (threat profiling for hunting), scaffolding layers,
  and voter examples.

  - Ensure pedagogical progression: Lower levels test recall/understanding; higher simulate active learning (e.g., apply to
  scenarios).

  - Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each strictly matching the Flashcard Schema (question, answer, distractors[exactly
  3], bloom_level[enum], explanation, topic_hierarchy[array]).

  - Vary formats: MCQ (lower), scenario/open (higher). Make explanations educational, linking to objectives/scaffolding.

  - Enforce completeness: Cover all core concepts, ATT&CK/STIX comparisons, JSON structures, import/use, case studies.'
