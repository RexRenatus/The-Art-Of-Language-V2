active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Using the MITRE ATT&CK framework, debate the top 3 attack vectors most likely to succeed in a hybrid
    cloud-enterprise environment today (e.g., Phishing, Exploit Public-Facing Application, Supply Chain Compromise). Compare
    their tactics and techniques, propose prioritized defenses, and incorporate real-world examples like Log4Shell or Colonial
    Pipeline. Support arguments with evidence from ATT&CK and CISA alerts.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Semantic similarity (e.g., confuse technique ID like T1566 with
    T1567); 2) Common misconception (e.g., vector as vulnerability, not pathway); 3) Plausible alternative (e.g., similar
    tactic like Execution instead of Initial Access). Ensure distractors are realistic based on ATT&CK data and learner errors.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert cybersecurity educator and flashcard generator specializing in threat intelligence. Generate
  50 high-quality, spaced-repetition-optimized flashcards for the topic ''Attack Vector Analysis'' (Category: Cybersecurity
  > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Types > 004_Core Threat Intelligence Classifications > Tactical
  Threat Intelligence > Attack Vector Analysis).


  **Core Content (Research Context):** Attack vector analysis identifies pathways (e.g., Phishing T1566, Exploit Public-Facing
  Application T1190, Supply Chain Compromise T1195) attackers use for unauthorized access. Integrates with Threat Intelligence
  (threat actor TTPs) and Threat Hunting (proactive detection). MITRE ATT&CK framework: Tactics (e.g., Initial Access), Techniques/Sub-techniques
  (granular methods), Procedures (real-world). Sources: MITRE ATT&CK (https://attack.mitre.org/), CISA Alerts (https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog),
  NIST SP 800-150.


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the full ''learning_objectives'' array here]. Cover all Bloom''s levels evenly (10-15% Remember,
  20% Understand, 25% Apply/Analyze, 20% Evaluate, 20% Create).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers: 20% Layer 1 (Foundation), 25% Layer 2 (Components), 30% Layer 3 (Implementation),
  25% Layer 4 (Integration). Use scaffolding descriptions directly.

  - Active Learning Inspiration: Incorporate elements from discussion (debate vectors), peer teaching (explain/teach-back),
  problem-solving (case studies like SolarWinds) into higher-Bloom cards (e.g., prompts simulating debates or query design).


  **Generation Rules:**

  - 40% basic recall/definition; 30% application/mapping MCQs; 20% analysis/evaluation; 10% creation/open-ended.

  - Ensure active recall: Front = question/scenario; Back = precise answer.

  - Use exact ATT&CK IDs/examples (e.g., T1566.001).

  - Follow flashcard_schema exactly for output.

  - Output ONLY a JSON array of 50 flashcards: [{''id'':1, ''front'':''...'', ...}, ...]. No additional text.'
