active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, Student A explains how firewall policies integrate with EDLs for technical threat intelligence;
    Student B teaches back using a custom example (e.g., blocking a mock C2 domain). Switch roles and address misconceptions
    like 'automation eliminates all human error.' (Builds understanding and identifies gaps.)
  problem_solving: In groups, receive a mock threat intel feed (e.g., IPs/domains from AlienVault OTX). Design, implement
    (using tools like pfSense or Python scripts), and test automated firewall rules. Evaluate outcomes in a simulated environment
    and present failure modes (e.g., over-blocking legitimate traffic). (Promotes hands-on application and collaboration.)

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ (4 options: 1 correct, 3 distractors):

    - Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., ''Automation eliminates false positives'' vs. reality).

    - Distractor 2: Plausible confusion (e.g., mix up EDLs with static lists).

    - Distractor 3: Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Always better than manual'' ignoring scalability issues).

    Base on voter-noted pitfalls (false positives, over-reliance on automation) and research (e.g., NIST risks).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, aligned with university pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 25-35 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Firewall Rule
  Automation'' (Category: Cybersecurity, Domain: Threat Intelligence And Hunting, Subdomain: Threat Intelligence Types, Entry
  Domain: 004_Core Threat Intelligence Classifications, Entry Subdomain: Technical Threat Intelligence). Note: This topic
  operationalizes technical TI (IoCs) via automation, not a TI type itself.


  Incorporate this research context: Firewall monitors/controls traffic per rules/policies. Threat intelligence provides IoCs
  (IPs, domains). EDLs enable dynamic firewall updates from feeds (e.g., Palo Alto). Threat hunting uses automation proactively.
  NIST SP 800-41 guides policy management. Risks: False positives, over-blocking.


  Use these exact elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the array above]. Distribute flashcards across levels (4-6 per level).

  - Active Learning: Embed concepts from discussion/peer/problem-solving into explanations (e.g., reference debate risks).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute evenly across 4 layers [paste scaffolding descriptions].

  - Prior Knowledge: Assume basics in firewalls/networking/threat intel classifications.

  - 4-Layer Coverage: Ensure progression from foundation to integration.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly [paste schema]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, no extra text. Ensure variety: 70%
  MCQ, cover hierarchy, voter priorities (e.g., steps, misconceptions), and web context. Make questions challenging yet fair
  for Bloom''s progression.'
