active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a corporate network, you observe a spike in outbound HTTPS traffic to a rare IP address during off-hours.
    Debate whether this is likely data exfiltration, C2 communication, or legitimate business activity. What additional data
    (e.g., user context, DNS resolution, packet payloads) would you collect to confirm? Discuss false positives like software
    updates.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''All outbound
    traffic is normal if encrypted''), 2) Partial truths (e.g., mix normal/abnormal traits), 3) Edge cases/false positives
    (e.g., legitimate VPN traffic), 4) Voter-noted pitfalls (e.g., ignoring baselines). Ensure distractors are realistic to
    promote critical thinking.'
