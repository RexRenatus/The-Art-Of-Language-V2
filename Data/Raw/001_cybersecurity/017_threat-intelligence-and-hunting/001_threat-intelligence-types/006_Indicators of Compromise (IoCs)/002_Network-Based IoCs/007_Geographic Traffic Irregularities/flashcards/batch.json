      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The core objective of analyzing geographic traffic irregularities in threat hunting is to detect security threats. By identifying traffic that deviates from expected patterns in terms of its origin or destination geography, threat hunters can uncover indicators of malicious activity like botnet C2 communication, DDoS attacks originating from unexpected regions, or data exfiltration attempts masked by unusual routing. This analysis helps prioritize investigations and respond to potential security incidents.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The correct answer clearly states the security-focused goal of threat hunting for geographic anomalies. The distractors propose unrelated goals like network optimization, regulatory compliance, or marketing intelligence, which are not the primary objectives of this security analysis.",
        "analogy": "It's like a security guard monitoring surveillance cameras. They look for unusual activity (traffic anomalies) in unexpected places (geographic regions) to spot potential intruders (threats), not to see where customers are buying the most products (marketing) or if the cameras are working efficiently (performance)."
