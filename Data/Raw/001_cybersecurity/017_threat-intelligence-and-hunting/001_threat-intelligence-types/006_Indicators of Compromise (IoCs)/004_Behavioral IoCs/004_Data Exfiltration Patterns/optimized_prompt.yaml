active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between stealth (e.g., DNS tunneling) and speed (e.g., cloud
    services like Dropbox) in data exfiltration patterns. How do these impact dwell time, and what behavioral IoCs would you
    prioritize for hunting?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Zeek logs for large HTTP POSTs); 3. Behavioral rules (Sigma: high entropy DNS, unusual RDP); 4. Tools (Wireshark for PCAPs,
    Splunk/ELK for logs). MITRE mappings: TA0010 techniques.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Threat Intelligence. Topic:
  Data Exfiltration Patterns (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Types > 006_Indicators
  of Compromise (IoCs) > Behavioral IoCs > Data Exfiltration Patterns). Use the provided learning_objectives, active_learning,
  scaffolding (including prior_knowledge_connections and concept_map), and flashcard_schema to generate high-quality flashcards.


  Incorporate: Voter consensus (82.9% approval); Complete patterns (DNS Tunneling, ICMP, HTTP, SMB/RDP/FTP, C2, Cloud (Dropbox/OneDrive),
  Email, Physical Media); Sources (offensivebytes.com, attack.mitre.org/TA0010, hunt.io). Ensure university pedagogy: Bloom''s
  progression, active recall, spaced repetition-friendly.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 25-30 flashcards, each strictly matching the flashcard_schema (question, correct_answer, distractors
  [exactly 3 strings], explanation, bloom_level, scaffolding_layer). Cover all objectives/layers evenly. Questions must be
  precise, distractors plausible/misconception-based, explanations pedagogical with MITRE links.'
