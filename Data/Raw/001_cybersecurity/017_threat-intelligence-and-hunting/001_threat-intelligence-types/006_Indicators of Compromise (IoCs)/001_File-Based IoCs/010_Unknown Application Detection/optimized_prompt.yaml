    - explain
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the pros and cons of whitelisting versus behavioral detection for unknown applications. Use MITRE
    ATT&CK examples (e.g., T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter) to support arguments, considering misconceptions like
    assuming all unknown apps are malicious (vs. shadow IT).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ cards (25% of total): Generate 3 plausible distractors based on: (1) Common misconceptions
    (e.g., ''All unknown apps are malware'' vs. ''May include shadow IT''); (2) Partial truths (e.g., correct for one context
    but not this); (3) Opposites/extremes (e.g., ''Only use static IoCs'' vs. behavioral); (4) Voter-suggested non-examples.
    Ensure 1 correct, 3 distractors; randomize order. Explanation must justify why each distractor is wrong.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using Bloom''s Taxonomy, active
  learning, and scaffolding for optimal retention. Topic: Unknown Application Detection (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat
  Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Types > 006_Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) > File-Based IoCs > Unknown Application
  Detection). Use the provided learning_objectives, active_learning components, scaffolding_layers (which include prior knowledge,
  best practices, misconceptions, and sources), and flashcard_schema EXACTLY.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards (balanced: ~4 per Bloom''s level, ~6 per layer; 25% MCQ, 25% cloze, 25% definition,
  25% scenario/application). Ensure comprehensive coverage: 20% prior knowledge/file-IoCs link; emphasize best practices (baseline,
  monitoring, analysis); integrate MITRE ATT&CK, EASM/ASM; address misconceptions (e.g., shadow IT). Cards must promote active
  recall, spaced repetition best practices.


  Incorporate active learning: Tie explanations to discussion/peer/problem-solving where relevant (e.g., ''Supports debate
  on whitelisting vs. behavioral''). Use web-grounded context: Definitions from research (unknown app as unrecognized software;
  threat hunting proactive).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcard objects matching the flashcard_schema structure. No additional text.'
