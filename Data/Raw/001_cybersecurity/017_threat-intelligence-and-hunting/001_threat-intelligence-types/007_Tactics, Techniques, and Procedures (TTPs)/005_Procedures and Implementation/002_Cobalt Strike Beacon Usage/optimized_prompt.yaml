active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical boundaries of using Cobalt Strike Beacon in red team exercises
    versus its abuse by threat actors. How do Malleable C2 profiles blur the line between legitimate simulation and malicious
    activity? Support your views with real-world examples from threat intelligence reports.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Plausible based on voter-noted misconceptions: e.g., confuse staged (two payloads) vs stageless (single shellcode);
      jitter as ''random noise'' vs ''callback masking''; Malleable as ''encryption'' vs ''traffic shaping''.'
    - '3 distractors per MCQ: 1 partially correct (e.g., ''Stageless requires stager''), 1 common error (e.g., ''Beacon only
      uses HTTP''), 1 irrelevant (e.g., ''Beacon is a keylogger'').'
    - 'Tie to real IOCs/misconceptions from research: e.g., wrong user-agent or protocol.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert cybersecurity educator and flashcard generator specializing in threat intelligence. Generate\
  \ 30 high-quality flashcards on 'Cobalt Strike Beacon Usage' (Category: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting\
  \ > Threat Intelligence Types > 007_Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) > Procedures and Implementation). \n\nIncorporate\
  \ these pedagogical elements:\n- Bloom's Taxonomy objectives: [insert full list from learning_objectives].\n- Scaffolding\
  \ layers: [insert full scaffolding details]. Ensure even coverage across layers.\n- Voter priorities: Complete stageless\
  \ beacons (single shellcode, no stager), expand payload variants (reflective DLLs), protocols (HTTP/DNS/SMB), detection/hunting\
  \ (IOCs, SIEM queries), Malleable C2.\n- Active learning tie-ins: Cards should support discussions (e.g., evasion ethics),\
  \ peer teaching (components), problem-solving (PCAP analysis).\n- Prior knowledge: MITRE TA0002/T1071, networking basics.\n\
  - Research context: Beacon as C2 implant; Team Server; post-exploitation; sources like vectra.ai, cynet.com.\n\nUse exact\
  \ flashcard schema: Output ONLY a JSON array of 30 objects with fields: front, back, type, bloom_level, layer, explanation,\
  \ distractors (array or null for non-MCQ). Follow distractor protocol strictly. Mix card types for active recall. Ensure\
  \ educational depth for threat hunters: Include IOCs, mitigations, real-world evasion. Cards must promote reflection and\
  \ error correction."
