        "core_logic": "Remote Services is an Initial Access (and Lateral Movement) technique because it uses common network protocols like SMB and RDP to access systems, functioning by leveraging existing network infrastructure and protocols. This allows adversaries to move laterally after initial compromise or gain access if these services are exposed.",
