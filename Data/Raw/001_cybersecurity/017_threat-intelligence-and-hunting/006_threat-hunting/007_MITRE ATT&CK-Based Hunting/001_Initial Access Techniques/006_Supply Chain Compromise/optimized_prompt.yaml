learning_objectives:
  analyze:
  - objective: Compare and contrast software supply chain attacks (e.g., CI/CD pipeline compromise) versus hardware supply
      chain attacks (e.g., firmware tampering).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  create:
  - objective: Design a threat hunting query (e.g., using Sigma or Splunk) to detect indicators of supply chain compromise,
      such as tampered artifacts or anomalous dependency downloads.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  understand:
  - objective: Explain Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) and common attack vectors such as typosquatting,
      malicious updates, and dependency confusion.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Identify potential supply chain risks in a given organizational scenario, mapping them to MITRE ATT&CK techniques
      like T1195.001 (Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  remember:
  - objective: Define supply chain compromise and list the key components of the supply chain ecosystem (e.g., developers,
      manufacturers, acquirers, integrators).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  evaluate:
  - objective: Critique the effectiveness of NIST SP 800-161 and SP 1305 frameworks for mitigating supply chain risks in a
      threat hunting context.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
