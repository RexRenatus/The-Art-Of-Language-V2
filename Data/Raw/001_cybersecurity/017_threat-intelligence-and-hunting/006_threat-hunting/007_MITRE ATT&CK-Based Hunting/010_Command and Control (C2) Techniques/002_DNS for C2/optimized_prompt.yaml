active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of DNS tunneling for C2 versus HTTP/S-based C2 channels (MITRE T1071). Consider
    factors like stealth, bandwidth limitations, detectability via anomaly detection, and countermeasures. What would you
    prioritize in a high-security enterprise environment, and why? Reference real-world examples from threat reports.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    fully blocks C2'' (ignore opt-in). 3. Irrelevant: Normal DNS like caching. 4. Edge cases: DGA as ''phishing''. Ensure
    distractors teach via explanation.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in MITRE ATT&CK-based threat
  hunting. Topic: ''DNS for C2'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > 011_Threat Hunting > 007_MITRE
  ATT&CK-Based Hunting > Command and Control (C2) Techniques > DNS for C2). Use provided research context on DNS beaconing/tunneling,
  MITRE T1071/T1095/T1573, indicators (entropy, fast-flux, DGA, NXDOMAIN), NIST SP 800-81-2, SANS detection guides.


  Incorporate pedagogy: Learning objectives [paste array above], active learning activities [reference for scenarios], 4-layer
  scaffolding [paste array above] with prior knowledge (DNS basics, MITRE, C2). Align cards to Bloom''s Taxonomy.


  Generate 50-75 flashcards following exact schema [paste schema above]. Output as JSON array of objects. Ensure high-quality:
  Measurable, engaging, misconception-busting distractors. Cover all objectives/layers proportionally. Include concept map
  elements (e.g., ''Link DNS C2 to MITRE T1071''). Sources: MITRE ATT&CK, NIST SP 800-81-2 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-81-2.pdf),
  SANS DNS Tunneling papers.'
