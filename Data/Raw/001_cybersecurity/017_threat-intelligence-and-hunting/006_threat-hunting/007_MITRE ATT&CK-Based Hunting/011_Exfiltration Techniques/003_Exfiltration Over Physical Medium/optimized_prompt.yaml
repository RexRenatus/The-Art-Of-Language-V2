active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the risks of exfiltration over physical medium in air-gapped environments
    like nuclear facilities. Propose and critique mitigations, referencing real-world examples like Agent.btz or Stuxnet,
    and connect to broader MITRE ATT&CK exfiltration tactics (T1020-T1048).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

      as physical), partial truths (e.g., ''Only works on Windows'').'
    - 'Common errors: Confuse with C2 (T1071), overlook air-gapped context, wrong sub-technique (e.g., T1052.002 instead of
      .001).'

  Key Content:

  - Definition: Adversaries use physical media (USB, SD cards, HDDs) for data exfiltration, esp. air-gapped nets.

  - Mitigations: Disable autorun, Group Policy USB restrictions, DLP content inspection, full disk encryption, endpoint USB
  monitoring.

  - Detections: Sysmon EID 15/16/17 (USB insert/remove/process), EDR file copy rules, behavioral analytics.

  - Hunting: SIEM queries e.g., ''EventCode=200 AND TargetFilename:*USB*''.
