  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Active learning: [insert summaries]

  - Scaffolding: Teach progressively from Layer 1 (definitions, e.g., HKCU/HKLM, full Run key paths) to Layer 4 (Sigma/EQL
  hunts, evasion).

  - Prior knowledge: Windows Registry basics, MITRE T1547.

  - Concept map: Persistence → Run Keys (list all), Startup Folders, Detection (Autoruns/PS/Sigma).


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards per schema: 10 basic/cloze (REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND), 20 MCQ (ANALYZE with distractors),
  20 application (APPLY/EVALUATE/CREATE, scenarios with PS outputs).


  Schema details: [insert full schema above]. Ensure web-grounded (e.g., Autoruns from Sysinternals, Sigma rules for Run key
  creation). Balance coverage: 40% keys/folders, 30% detection/hunting, 20% analysis/risks, 10% integration.


  Output ONLY valid JSON array: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''options'': [...] if MCQ, ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''blooms_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': 1-4}]. No extra text.'
