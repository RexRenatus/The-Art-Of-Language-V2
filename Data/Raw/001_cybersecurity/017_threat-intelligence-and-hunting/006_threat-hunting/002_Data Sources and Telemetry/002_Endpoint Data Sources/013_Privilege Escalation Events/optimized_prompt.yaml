  Incorporate this research context: Privilege escalation exploits for higher access (vertical: low-to-root e.g., Dirty COW
  CVE-2016-5195, PrintNightmare CVE-2021-34527; horizontal: peer access e.g., IDOR). MITRE T1548 Abuse Elevation Control (subs:
  T1548.001 UAC Bypass via fodhelper/cmstp; T1055 Injection). Endpoint telemetry: Windows Security 4672 (privs assigned),
  4673 (privs used), 4688 (high-integrity creation), 4703 (token manip); Sysmon 1 (proc create high IL), 10 (proc access);
  Linux /var/log/auth.log sudo, auditd. Big picture: Detects early in attack chain for hunting disruption. Prior: EDR/Sysmon
  basics, TA0001 Initial Access.
