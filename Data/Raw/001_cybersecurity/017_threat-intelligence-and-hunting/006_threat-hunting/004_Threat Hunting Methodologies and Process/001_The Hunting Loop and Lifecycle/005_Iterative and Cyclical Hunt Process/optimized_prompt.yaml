active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How might the cyclical nature of the hunting process address common misconceptions like assuming threats
    are always detectable by signatures? Discuss with examples from real-world APT hunts.
  peer_teaching: In groups, assign each team one stage of the hunting loop. Prepare a 5-minute peer teaching session including
    a step-by-step example, a diagram snippet, and how it connects to other stages. Present and field questions.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: You are a SOC analyst with anonymized log data showing unusual DNS queries (e.g., high-volume
    queries to rare domains) and endpoint telemetry indicating unexpected process execution. Iterate through the full hunting
    loop: develop a hypothesis (e.g., DNS tunneling), collect/analyze data, deep dive, respond, and feedback. Identify the
    anomaly and propose mitigations.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert cybersecurity educator and flashcard generator specializing in threat hunting. Generate
  25 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Iterative and Cyclical Hunt Process'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence
  And Hunting > 011_Threat Hunting > 011_002_Threat Hunting Methodologies and Process > The Hunting Loop and Lifecycle > Iterative
  and Cyclical Hunt Process). Voter consensus: 100% approval on pedagogy, completeness, problem-solving.


  Core Content (web-grounded from hunt.io, intel471.com, MITRE, SANS, Diamond Model):

  - Threat hunting: Proactive, iterative loop to find hidden threats (5 stages): 1. Hypothesis (from intel/IOCs); 2. Data
  Collection/Analysis (logs/telemetry); 3. Deep Dive/Investigation; 4. Response/Uncover; 5. Feedback/Lessons Learned. Cyclical
  with feedback arrows.

  - Frameworks: MITRE ATT&CK (hypotheses/tactics), Diamond Model (intrusion analysis), SANS methodologies.

  - Key: Iteration refines detection; proactive vs. reactive.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the learning_objectives array here].

  - Active Learning: Inspire cards testing discussion (cyclical vs. signatures), peer teaching (stage details), problem-solving
  (log scenarios).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards: 6 Layer1, 7 Layer2, 7 Layer3, 5 Layer4.

  - Bloom''s: 4 remember/understand, 8 apply/analyze, 8 evaluate/create, 5 mixed.

  - Prerequisites: IOCs, logs, threat intel.

  - Visualize: Cards on diagram (e.g., ''Describe feedback arrows'').

  - Real-world: APT hunts, SIEM integration.


  Use exact flashcard_schema for output: JSON array of 25 cards. Ensure variety (10 MCQ, 5 sequence, 10 others). Distractors
  per protocol. Explanations pedagogical, tied to objectives/layers. Factual, no fabrication. Output ONLY the JSON array.'
