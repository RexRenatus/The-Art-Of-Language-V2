active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of the Threat Hunting Loop, debate the trade-offs between TTP-based analytics and IOC-based
    detection. Provide examples from MITRE ATT&CK (e.g., T1566 Phishing where IOCs evade due to customization, but TTPs detect
    behavioral patterns). How does this impact automation in Phase 4?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
