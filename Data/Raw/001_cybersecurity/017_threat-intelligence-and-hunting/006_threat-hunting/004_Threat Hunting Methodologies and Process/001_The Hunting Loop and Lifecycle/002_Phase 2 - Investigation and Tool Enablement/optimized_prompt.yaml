active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how mapping TTPs from the MITRE ATT&CK framework to specific stages of
    the Cyber Kill Chain (e.g., Command and Control stage) can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of Phase 2 investigations.
    Provide real-world examples of successes or pitfalls, and propose improvements for tool enablement in diverse environments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Partial truth (e.g., correct tool but wrong phase); (3) Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., ''all tools are SIEM''). Ensure
    distractors test nuance (e.g., MITRE vs. Kill Chain differences) and are derived from real-world pitfalls in threat hunting.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Threat Hunting. Generate

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives: [insert full learning_objectives array here].

  - Scaffolding: Cover Layers 1-4 progressively [insert full scaffolding_layers here].

  - Voter consensus: Full Cyber Kill Chain (7 stages), tools (Splunk SIEM, CrowdStrike EDR, Wireshark), MITRE ATT&CK mappings,
  steps (select tools, collect/analyze, correlate TTPs, validate).

  - Research: IOCs (past evidence), IOAs (ongoing), TTPs (methods); sources Palo Alto, Bitsight.

  - Active learning integration: Cards should prompt critical thinking/discussion.


  Use exact flashcard schema: [insert full flashcard_schema here]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, e.g., [{''id'':1,
  ''bloom_level'':''Remember'', ''scaffolding_layer'':1, ''type'':''mcq'', ''front'':''What is an IOC? A) ...'', ''back'':{''correct_answer'':''...'',
  ''explanation'':''...'', ''distractors'':[''A'',''B'',''C'']}}, ...]. Ensure coverage: 6-8 cards per layer, span all Bloom
  levels, 60% MCQ, 20% cloze, 20% short answer. Cards must be optimized for spaced repetition and active recall.'
