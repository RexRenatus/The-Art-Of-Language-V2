      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "CISA advisories highlight shared local administrator credentials as a significant risk. Machine-assisted hunting can detect this by identifying patterns of identical credentials being used across numerous hosts, which directly enables lateral movement and unauthorized access, a key finding that needs remediation.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The correct answer accurately describes how ML hunting detects the specific issue of shared credentials and its implications. Distractors propose automated enforcement (ML detects, doesn't enforce), a scope limitation (servers over workstations), or a less critical anomaly (time of use), missing the core problem.",
        "analogy": "Detecting shared admin credentials with ML is like finding out multiple employees are using the same master key to access different parts of a building. The ML spots this pattern, highlighting the risk that if one key is compromised, many areas are vulnerable."
