active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of relying solely on commercial CTI feeds versus combining
    them with OSINT sources. Consider factors like cost, timeliness, and customization for a mid-sized SOC team handling ransomware
    threats. Provide evidence from real-world examples like CrowdStrike or Recorded Future.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
