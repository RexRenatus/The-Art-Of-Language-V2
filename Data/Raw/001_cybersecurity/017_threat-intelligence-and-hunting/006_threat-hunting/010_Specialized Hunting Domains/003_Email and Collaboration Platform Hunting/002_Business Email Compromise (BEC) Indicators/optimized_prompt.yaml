active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether spoofed display names or urgent language requests are more dangerous
    BEC indicators in a corporate environment. Support your position with real-world FBI case examples (e.g., billions in
    losses from executive impersonation scams) and propose mitigation strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors based on: (1) Frequent student errors (e.g., confusing BEC with malware IoCs);
    (2) Similar but non-BEC indicators (e.g., generic phishing links vs. wire requests); (3) Partial accuracies (e.g., ''exact
    domain match'' instead of lookalike); (4) Voter-noted gaps (e.g., false positives like legit urgent emails). Ensure 70%
    plausibility to challenge learners.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Business Email Compromise
  (BEC) Indicators (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > 011_Threat Hunting > 010_Specialized
  Hunting Domains > Email and Collaboration Platform Hunting > BEC Indicators). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy
  objectives, active learning (discussion: spoofed names vs. urgent language debate; peer teaching on indicators; problem-solving
  with 6 sample emails + SIEM queries), 4-layer scaffolding (Layer 1: Foundation - defs/prereqs; Layer 2: Components - indicators/relationships;
  Layer 3: Implementation - hunting steps; Layer 4: Integration - playbooks/SIEM/ML).


  Key Content: BEC definition (financial fraud via impersonation/social engineering/spoofing); Indicators: spoofed domains
  (e.g., lookalikes), inconsistent style (grammar/misspellings/lack of personalization), urgent requests, mismatched signatures,
  attachments/links, wire transfers/gift cards, header anomalies (IoCs/IoAs). FBI losses: billions. Sources: fbi.gov, vpnunlimited.com.


  Generate 25 flashcards following this schema:

  - JSON array: [{''front'': ''... [Bloom:REMEMBER] [Layer:1]'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''... (tie
  to active learning/research)'', ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'', ''opt3''] (if MCQ), ''references'': ''...'' }}]

  - Varied Q types (50% MCQ w/ distractors per protocol: misconceptions/partial truths), balance objectives/layers.

  - Ensure scaffolding progression, voter completeness (full indicators), measurable outcomes. Output ONLY the JSON array.'
