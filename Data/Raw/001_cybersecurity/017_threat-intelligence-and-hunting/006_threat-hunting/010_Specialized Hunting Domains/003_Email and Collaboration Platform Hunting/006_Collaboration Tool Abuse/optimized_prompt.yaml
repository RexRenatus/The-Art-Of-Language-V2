active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the risks of collaboration tool abuse in remote work environments post-COVID.
    Argue whether LOTL techniques in tools like Teams make traditional signature-based detection obsolete, using real-world
    examples like Hive0065's Teams C2 abuse.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
