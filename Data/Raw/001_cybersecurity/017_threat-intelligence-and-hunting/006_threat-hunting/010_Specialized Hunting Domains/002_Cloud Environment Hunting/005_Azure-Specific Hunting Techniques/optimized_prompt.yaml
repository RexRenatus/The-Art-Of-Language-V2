  **Completed Research Context:**

  Azure-Specific Threat Hunting Techniques: Proactive search for threats in Azure using tools like Microsoft Sentinel. Core
  Concepts: Threat Hunting (proactive detection assuming breach); Azure Security (tools/services); Cloud Challenges (ephemeral
  resources, API attacks, identity sprawl, serverless blind spots). Frameworks: MITRE ATT&CK for Cloud (e.g., T1078.004: Unusual
  cloud account logins; T1530: Data from Cloud Storage). Microsoft Sentinel: KQL for queries (e.g., T1078.004 sample: SigninLogs
  | where ResultType == 50126 | summarize count() by IPAddress, UserPrincipalName | where count_ > 10); Hunting workbook;
  Hunts (Preview): Scheduled, proactive hunts with bookmarks and entity tracking for persistence hunting. Anomaly hunting:
  Azure AD logs for rare IPs/users. Sources: mitre.org/attack/matrices/cloud, docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/hunting-queries,
  wiz.io/blog/cloud-threat-hunting-best-practices, recordedfuture.com/cloud-threat-hunting, microsoft.com/security/blog/sentinel-hunts-preview.

  (Layer 1-2), 40% APPLY/ANALYZE (Layer 3), 40% EVALUATE/CREATE (Layer 4). Questions should scaffold from foundation to integration,
  assessable with success criteria (e.g., ''correctly identify''). Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, no other text.'
