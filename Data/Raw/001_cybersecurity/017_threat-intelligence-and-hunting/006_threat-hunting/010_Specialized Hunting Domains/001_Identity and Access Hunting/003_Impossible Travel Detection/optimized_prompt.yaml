active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss the trade-offs between false positives in impossible travel detection (e.g., due to VPNs or proxies)
    and the risk of missing real ATO attacks. How can organizations balance privacy concerns (e.g., geolocation tracking)
    with security needs? Provide examples from real-world frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., ''Ignores timezones'' instead of feasible travel).

    - Distractor 2: Partial truth (e.g., ''Only cloud logs'' vs. multi-source).

    - Distractor 3: Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., ''100% accurate, no false positives''). Base on real pitfalls like VPNs,
    baselines, or MITRE mis-mappings. Ensure distractors are realistic for cybersecurity learners.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Threat Hunting. Generate
  25 high-quality flashcards on ''Impossible Travel Detection'' (Category: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting
  > 011_Threat Hunting > 010_Specialized Hunting Domains > Identity and Access Hunting > Impossible Travel Detection). Voter
  consensus: 82.9% approval.


  Incorporate:

  - Research Context: [Impossible Travel Detection summary: Core Concepts (Impossible Travel, ATO, UEBA, Log Analysis, Cross-Correlation);
  Frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK TA0001/T1078); Best Practices (threshold tuning, false positives via VPNs/proxies, ML baselines)].

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the full learning_objectives array above].

  - Active Learning: Tie explanations to discussion (false positive trade-offs), peer teaching (implementation steps), problem-solving
  (log correlation).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards: ~6 Layer 1, ~6 Layer 2, ~7 Layer 3, ~6 Layer 4. Cover all Bloom''s levels evenly.


  Output a JSON array of 25 flashcards, each exactly matching this schema: [paste full flashcard_schema.structure].

  Use university pedagogy: Questions progress from recall to creation; explanations scaffold learning with examples (e.g.,
  sample logs: {''user'':''alice'',''time'':''2023-01-01T10:00Z'',''ip'':''8.8.8.8'',''geo'':''NY''}, {''time'':''2023-01-01T10:05Z'',''ip'':''1.1.1.1'',''geo'':''Tokyo''}
  -> impossible). Include 40% MCQs. Ensure explanations are educational, with active recall prompts. No duplicates; vary formats.'
