active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the pros and cons of implementing a Dedicated Hunt Team Model versus an integrated SOC model.
    Use real-world breaches like SolarWinds to argue effectiveness in proactive detection versus reactive response, considering
    factors like cost, expertise, and threat sophistication.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Plausible based on common errors: e.g., ''Reactive alerting team'' as distractor for Dedicated Hunt Team.'
    - 'Mix facts: e.g., correct IoA behavior vs. distractor IoC artifact.'
    - 'Contextual: Tie to frameworks (wrong MITRE tactic), real-world (SolarWinds reactive focus).'
    - 3 distractors per MCQ, one 'best' wrong answer.
    - Avoid obvious errors; ensure 60-70% plausible to force analysis.
