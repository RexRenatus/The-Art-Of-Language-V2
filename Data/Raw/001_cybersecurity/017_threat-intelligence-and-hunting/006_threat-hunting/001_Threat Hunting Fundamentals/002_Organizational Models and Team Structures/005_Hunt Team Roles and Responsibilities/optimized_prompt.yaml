active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of centralizing Hunt Lead responsibilities versus distributing
    them across senior analysts in a small organization. Use examples from MITRE or SANS guidelines to support your arguments
    and connect to prior knowledge of SOC roles.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., overlapping but incorrect role), 3) Extreme/outdated practice (e.g., ignore CTI). Ensure distractors are realistic
    from industry sources but incorrect.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Threat Hunting. Use the
  following context to generate high-quality, pedagogically optimized flashcards for the topic ''Hunt Team 003: Roles and
  Responsibilities'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > 011_Threat Hunting > 011_001_Threat
  Hunting Fundamentals > Organizational Models and Team Structures > Hunt Team 003_Roles and Responsibilities).


  **Core Content (Completed and Expanded per Best Practices - MITRE, SANS, CrowdStrike, BitSight):** Threat Hunting assumes
  adversaries are present; Hunt Team 003 includes: Hunt Lead (strategy, coordination, reporting); Threat Hunter Analyst (hypothesis
  dev, data hunts, TTP mapping); Intelligence Specialist (CTI curation, IOC/IOA prioritization); Responder (validation, remediation).
  Responsibilities: Proactive discovery, tool use (SIEM/EDR), collaboration with SOC.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list from JSON].

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full scaffolding from JSON].

  **Active Learning:** [Insert full active learning from JSON] - Link flashcards to these.


  **Flashcard Generation Instructions:**

  - Generate 25 flashcards balanced by Bloom''s levels and layers.

  - Follow exact schema: Front (Question), Back (Answer, Explanation, Bloom Level, Scaffolding Layer, Active Learning Link,
  Distractors for MCQs).

  - Distractors: Strictly per protocol.

  - Ensure completeness: Cover all roles/responsibilities, integrations.

  - Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'':
  ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''active_learning_link'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'', ''opt3'']}}].


  Prioritize voter suggestions: Completeness (full roles), pedagogy (Bloom''s/scaffolding), active elements. Base on research:
  Proactive hunting, TTPs, CTI.'
