  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: 'In pairs: One student explains a specific lifecycle phase (e.g., Reconnaissance), including key activities
    and TTPs; the partner teaches it back using a hypothetical threat hunting scenario and IOC example. Switch roles for another
    phase.'
  problem_solving: 'Analyze a case study (e.g., NotPetya ransomware): Map attack events to Cyber Kill Chain stages, identify
    missed hunting opportunities, and propose 2-3 hypothesis-driven queries for logs or endpoints.'

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs: 3 distractors per card. Make plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse Weaponization
    payload creation with Exploitation code execution; mix IOCs from adjacent phases like Delivery phishing with Installation

system_prompt: 'You are an expert educational flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity pedagogy. Generate high-quality,

  Hunting > 011_Threat Hunting > 011_001_Threat Hunting Fundamentals > 011_Threat Hunting Frameworks and Models > Cyber Attack
  Lifecycle. Voter consensus: 70% approval (7 voters) emphasizes completeness (full 7 phases: Reconnaissance [info gathering,
  port scans], Weaponization [malware creation], Delivery [phishing/USB], Exploitation [vulnerability trigger], Installation
  [backdoor persistence], C2 [attacker comms], Actions on Objectives [exfil/disrupt]); sources (Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill
  Chain, MITRE ATT&CK); Bloom''s progression; scaffolding; active learning.


  **Core Content (Completed Lifecycle):** Phases per Cyber Kill Chain: 1. Reconnaissance (passive/active intel, IOCs: DNS
  queries); 2. Weaponization (payload coupling); 3. Delivery (email/drive-by); 4. Exploitation (buffer overflow/zero-day);
  5. Installation (malware dropper); 6. C2 (beacons/DGA); 7. Actions (exfil/lateral). Hunting relevance: Early phases noisy,
  later stealthy. TTPs map to MITRE ATT&CK.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives from above].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Embed hooks in explanations (e.g., ''Discuss: Is this phase hardest to detect?'').


  **Scaffolding:** Distribute flashcards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4. [Insert full scaffolding descriptions].


  **Flashcard Generation Rules:** Follow schema exactly [insert full schema]. Ensure progressive complexity, prior knowledge
  links (networking basics), no overload. Varied formats for active recall. Output ONLY a JSON array of 75 flashcards.'
