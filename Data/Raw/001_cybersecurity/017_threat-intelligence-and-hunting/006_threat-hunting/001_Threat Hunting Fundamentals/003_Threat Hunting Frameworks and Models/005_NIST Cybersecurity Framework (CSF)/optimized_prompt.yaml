active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how the NIST CSF's DETECT Function complements or differs from MITRE ATT&CK
    in hypothesis-driven threat hunting. Provide examples from real-world incidents and evaluate which is more effective for
    proactive detection.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    strategy); 2) Partial truth (e.g., Tier 2 as ''Fully Adaptive''); 3) Unrelated concept (e.g., MITRE tactic instead of
    CSF Function). Ensure plausible for intermediate learners in threat hunting context.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST Cybersecurity Framework
  (CSF) 2.0 within Threat Hunting Frameworks and Models (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting
  > 011_Threat Hunting > 011_001_Threat Hunting Fundamentals > 011_Threat Hunting Frameworks and Models > NIST CSF).


  Incorporate: Full CSF 2.0 details (6 Functions: GOVERN (risk strategy), IDENTIFY (risks/assets), PROTECT (safeguards), DETECT
  (anomalies/threat hunting), RESPOND (mitigation), RECOVER (restoration); Tiers: Partial (Tier 1: informal/reactive), Risk
  Informed (Tier 2: approved/limited), Repeatable (Tier 3: formalized), Adaptive (Tier 4: proactive); Profiles, Categories/Subcategories).
  Connect to threat hunting (DETECT for hypothesis-driven hunting, GOVERN/IDENTIFY for risk-informed hypotheses; compare to
  MITRE ATT&CK/Diamond Model). Reference voter priorities: completeness on Tiers, Bloom''s progression, 4-layer scaffolding,
  prior knowledge links.


  Learning Objectives: [Insert full list above]. Active Learning: Use for scenario cards [Insert summaries]. Scaffolding:
  Distribute cards across 4 layers [Insert summaries].


  Generate flashcards using exact schema: [Insert full flashcard_schema above]. Ensure university pedagogy: Bloom''s (tag
  each), active recall, spaced repetition. Output ONLY valid JSON array of objects, 50-100 cards, grouped by layer/Bloom''s.
  No extra text.'
