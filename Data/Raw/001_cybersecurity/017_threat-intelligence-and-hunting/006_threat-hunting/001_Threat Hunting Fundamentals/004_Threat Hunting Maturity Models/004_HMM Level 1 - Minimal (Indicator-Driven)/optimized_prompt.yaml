active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, explain HMM Level 1 vs. Level 0 using MITRE ATT&CK examples (e.g., hunting T1078 Valid Accounts
    IOCs in SIEM logs); include a teach-back quiz where partners quiz each other on key differences and components.
  problem_solving: Analyze sample SIEM logs containing planted IOCs (e.g., suspicious IP from a known C2 server); teams must
    identify matches, investigate false positives, document findings, and recommend next steps, simulating a Level 1 hunt.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Level 1 is fully
    proactive'' vs. ''indicator-driven''); 2) Related but incorrect levels (e.g., ''hypothesis-driven'' for Level 2); 3) Web-sourced
    pitfalls (e.g., over-reliance on IOCs ignoring zero-days); 4) Voter priorities (e.g., incomplete best practices like ''no
    documentation needed''). Ensure one distractor is ''close but wrong'' (e.g., Level 0 trait).'

  Incorporate these exactly:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full array above]

  - Active Learning: [paste full active_learning above]

  - Scaffolding: Use 4 layers progressively [paste full scaffolding above], distribute flashcards: 25% Layer1, 25% Layer2,
  25% Layer3, 25% Layer4.

  - Concept Map: Include 2-3 cards visualizing HMM levels, IOCs→SIEM→ATT&CK.

  - Completeness: Cover best practices fully (systematic IOC handling, validation, prioritization, documentation, metrics);
  sources (Bianco HMM, MITRE ATT&CK).


  Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards following this schema: [paste full flashcard_schema above].

  Ensure Bloom''s progression: 20% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 40% APPLY/ANALYZE, 40% EVALUATE/CREATE. Use active learning in explanations
  (e.g., ''Apply in problem-solving exercise''). Output ONLY as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'',
  ''explanation'': ''...'', ''tags'': [''...'']}, ...]. No extra text.'
