active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the scenarios where ShimCache provides unique evidence of execution that
    volatile logs or other artifacts (e.g., Event Logs, Prefetch) might miss, such as deleted files or unsigned executables.
    Support your points with real-world threat hunting examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol:
    principles: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common errors: 1) superficial similarity (e.g., confuse
      LUT with Last Modified Time), 2) related but wrong artifact (e.g., Prefetch vs ShimCache), 3) version-specific misconception
      (e.g., hash field pre-Win10). Ensure distractors teach by correction in explanation.'
    examples:
    - 'For LUT: Correct ''first execution/access''; Distractors: ''last execution'', ''file creation'', ''last modified'''

  **Topic Summary (Completed Research Context):** ShimCache (AppCompatCache) stores exe metadata for Windows shimming (API
  redirection for compatibility). Location: SYSTEM hive \ControlSet001\Control\Session Manager\AppCompatCache. Fields: File
  Path, LUT (first exec/access time, not updated on re-run), Flags (0x2=executed), Size, Version, Hash (Win10+). Tools: PECmd,
  ShimCacheParser, Registry Explorer. Correlates with AmCache/Prefetch for timelines. Detects deleted files/LOLBins without
  logs.


  **Prior Knowledge Anchors:** Windows registry hives, MACB timestamps, Prefetch/AmCache basics.

  **Active Learning Ties:** Reference where relevant (e.g., ''Links to peer teaching on PECmd'').


  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly follow [Insert the full flashcard_schema here]. Output 25 flashcards as JSON array: [{''front'':
  ''...'', ''back'': {...}}, ...]. Ensure progressive coverage: 6 Layer1/REMEMBER, 6 Layer2/UNDERSTAND, 7 Layer3/APPLY, 6
  Layer4/ANALYZE-EVALUATE-CREATE. Use distractor protocol precisely. Make explanations educational, citing sources like Eric
  Zimmerman''s PECmd, Chainsaw wiki.'
