  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the trade-offs of deploying deception infrastructure versus traditional IDS/IPS: How does it
    impact false positives, operational overhead, and attacker dwell time? Use real-world examples like the 2021 SolarWinds
    attack to argue for proactive deception.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
