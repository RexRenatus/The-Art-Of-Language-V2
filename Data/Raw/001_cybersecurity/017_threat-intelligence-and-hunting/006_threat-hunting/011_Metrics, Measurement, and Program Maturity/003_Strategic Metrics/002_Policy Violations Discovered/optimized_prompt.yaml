active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the consequences of policy violations in threat hunting (e.g., data leakage
    from improper intelligence sharing). How do frameworks like NIST CSF and MITRE ATT&CK help prevent them? Support your
    points with real-world SOC audit examples and propose one improvement to program maturity metrics.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Topic: ''Policy Violations Discovered''
  (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > 011_Threat Hunting > 011_Metrics, Measurement, and Program
  Maturity > Strategic Metrics > Policy Violations Discovered). Use this optimized learning prompt to generate high-quality,
  pedagogical flashcards.


  **Research Context (Completed):** Policy violations in threat hunting: non-compliance in TI/hunting (e.g., data sharing
  breaches). NIST CSF: Functions (Identify-Protect-Detect-Respond-Recover); violations e.g., weak Detect. MITRE ATT&CK: TTPs
  uncovered via hunting; policy gaps in coverage. NIST Privacy Framework: Manage, Govern, etc., for PII in intel (violations:
  improper handling). Sources: NIST.gov/cyberframework, MITRE.org/attack, NIST Privacy Framework (nist.gov/privacy-framework),
  Verizon DBIR (policy stats), SANS Threat Hunting reports.


  **Incorporate:**

  - Learning Objectives: [paste array above]

  - Active Learning: Use for scenario-based cards.

  - Scaffolding: Prior Knowledge + 4 Layers + Concept Map [paste above]. Balance cards: 25% Layer1, 25% Layer2, 25% Layer3,
  25% Layer4.

  - Bloom''s: Mix levels across cards.

  - Voter Priorities: Completeness (full frameworks/sources), Pedagogy (SMART objectives), Scaffolding (layers), Progressive
  complexity.


  **Generate 25 flashcards per Flashcard Schema:** [paste schema above]. Output ONLY the JSON array. Ensure university-style:
  active recall, spaced repetition friendly, distractors from misconceptions.'
