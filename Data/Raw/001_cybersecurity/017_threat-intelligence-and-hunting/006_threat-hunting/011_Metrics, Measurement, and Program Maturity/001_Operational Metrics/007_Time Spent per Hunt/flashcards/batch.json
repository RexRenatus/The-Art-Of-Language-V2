        "core_logic": "Analyzing the 'time spent per hunt' in relation to the threat intelligence that initiated the hunt provides crucial insights into the 'actionability' of that intelligence. If intelligence consistently leads to time-consuming hunts, it suggests that either the intelligence is not specific enough, requires significant effort to validate, or that the hunting process for that type of intelligence needs optimization. This data helps refine intelligence requirements and improve the efficiency of translating intelligence into security actions.",
