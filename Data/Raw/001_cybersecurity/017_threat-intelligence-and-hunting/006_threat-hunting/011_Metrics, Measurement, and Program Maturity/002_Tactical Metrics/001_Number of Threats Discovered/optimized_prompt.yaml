active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent does the 'Number of Threats Discovered' metric reflect the maturity of a threat hunting
    program? In small groups, debate its pros (e.g., quantifies proactive success), cons (e.g., quantity over quality), and
    alternatives like breakout time reduction or threat quality scoring, referencing CrowdStrike 2024 stats (79% malware-free
    attacks, 442% vishing surge).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (40% of cards): Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse
    with detections/alerts, use reactive metrics like MTTD, inflate with duplicates, reference unrelated stats like 79% malware-free
    as ''threats''). Ensure distractors are realistic from research context (e.g., breakout time, vishing) but incorrect for
    the metric.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Threat Intelligence and
  Hunting. Topic: ''Number of Threats Discovered'' (Tactical Metric in 011_Threat Hunting > 011_Metrics, Measurement, and
  Program Maturity). Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > 011_Threat Hunting > 011_Metrics... > Tactical
  Metrics > Number of Threats Discovered.


  Key Content: Metric = count of unique threats (IoCs/TTPs) identified via proactive hunting (not detections). Calculation:
  Tally from SIEM/EDR hunt logs per period. Benchmarks: >10/month mature; correlates with <48-min breakout time. Context:
  CrowdStrike 2024 (79% malware-free, 442% vishing surge, GenAI adversaries).

  - Active Learning: Reference discussion (maturity debate), peer teaching (discovered vs. detection), problem-solving (SOC
  logs analysis).
