        "core_logic": "The coefficient of variation (COV) measures the relative variability of a dataset. A low COV for average bytes sent per bucket indicates that the packet sizes are consistently similar across different time intervals. This consistency in packet size is a hallmark of stealthy C2 beaconing, as it helps the traffic blend in with normal network patterns.",
