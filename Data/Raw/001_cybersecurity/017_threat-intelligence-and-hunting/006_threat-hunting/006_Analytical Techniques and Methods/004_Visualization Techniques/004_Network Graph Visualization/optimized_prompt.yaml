active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how network graph visualization overcomes the limitations of traditional
    tabular data analysis in threat hunting. Consider misconceptions like viewing graphs as 'pretty pictures' rather than
    analytical tools, and reference real-world examples from tools like BloodHound or Maltego. (Encourages critical thinking
    and links to prerequisites in basic graph theory and network fundamentals.)
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    viz'' ignoring interactive tools). 4) Voter-noted misconceptions. Ensure 60% plausible to test deep understanding.'

  Incorporate: Tools (Gephi, Neo4j, BloodHound, Maltego); Query langs (Cypher, Gremlin, OpenCypher); Integration (MITRE ATT&CK
  TTPs, NIST); Concept map (central ''Network Graph Viz'' linked to nodes/edges/tools/frameworks). Research: Nodes/entities,
  edges/relationships; aids threat hunting via patterns/anomalies.


  Balance: Per flashcard_schema rules. Ensure measurable, active recall. Distractors per protocol. Output ONLY flashcards
  in sequence, no intro/outro.'
