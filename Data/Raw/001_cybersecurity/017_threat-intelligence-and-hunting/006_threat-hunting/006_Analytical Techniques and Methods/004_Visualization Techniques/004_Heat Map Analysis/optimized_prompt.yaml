active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages and limitations of heat maps versus other visualization
    techniques (e.g., bar charts or network graphs) for prioritizing TTPs in threat hunting. Provide real-world examples from
    tools like ATT&CK Navigator and support your arguments with evidence from MITRE ATT&CK observations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common errors: 1) Partial truths (e.g., reverse colors), 2) Confusable
      terms (e.g., Tactics vs. Techniques), 3) Edge cases (e.g., low vs. no activity).'
    - Avoid randomness; ground in research (e.g., mix Enterprise/ICS matrices, incomplete color schemes).
    - Ensure 60% MCQ, 40% basic for variety.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert educational flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity pedagogy, using Bloom''s Taxonomy,
  active learning, and scaffolding for optimal retention. Topic: Heat Map Analysis (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence
  And Hunting > 011_Threat Hunting > 006_Analytical Techniques and Methods > Visualization Techniques > Heat Map Analysis).
  Use this synthesized content:


  [Insert full scaffolding content here, including completed color coding (Dark Red: Very High; Red: High; Orange: Medium;
  Yellow: Low; White/Gray: No observed activity), tools (ATT&CK Navigator, Recorded Future), big picture (prioritizes TTPs
  in hunting workflows), prerequisites, and research definitions from MITRE ATT&CK (Tactics/Techniques/Sub-techniques/Procedures,
  matrices: Enterprise/ICS/etc.)]. Voter consensus: 100% approval on completeness (full color schemes), pedagogy (objectives/layers),
  big picture.


  Learning Objectives: [paste array]. Active Learning: [reference activities for flashcard tie-ins, e.g., cards prompting
  discussion-style analysis]. Scaffolding: [paste layers].


  Generate 80 flashcards exactly matching the schema: {id, question, type, answer, options (array for MCQ), explanation (with
  rationale, misconceptions, refs, Bloom''s level, layer), tags}. Balance: 20 per layer, span all objectives (2+ per level).
  60% MCQ with distractors per protocol. Ensure university-level: active recall, spaced repetition friendly. Output ONLY a
  JSON array of objects, no extra text.'
