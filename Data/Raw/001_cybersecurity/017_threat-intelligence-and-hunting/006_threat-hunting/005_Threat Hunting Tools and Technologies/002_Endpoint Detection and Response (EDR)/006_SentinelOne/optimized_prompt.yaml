active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the shift from IoC-based to IoA-based detection in EDR tools like SentinelOne.
    How does this proactive approach using behavioral AI (e.g., Storylines) improve threat hunting outcomes compared to reactive
    SIEM alerts? Provide examples from MITRE ATT&CK frameworks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL DETAILS ABOVE] – Ensure cards prompt recall for discussions/activities.

  - Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL LAYERS ABOVE] – Distribute cards: 25% Layer 1, 30% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 20% Layer 4.

  - Best Practices: Integrate MITRE ATT&CK mapping, behavioral AI for IoAs, Vigilance intel, Storylines analysis, proactive
  queries.

  - Research: Use definitions (Threat Hunting, IoCs/IoAs, Singularity Platform, etc.) from SentinelOne.com.


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (mix: 40% multiple-choice, 30% cloze/short answer, 30% scenario-based). Follow EXACT
  Flashcard Schema: JSON array of objects with ''front'', ''back'' (answer, explanation, distractors), ''metadata''. Cover
  all Bloom''s levels proportionally (Remember/Understand: 30%, Apply/Analyze: 40%, Evaluate/Create: 30%). Ensure active recall,
  no hints on front. Distractors per protocol. Explanations tie to objectives/layers.
