        "core_logic": "The <code>-T fields</code> option, combined with <code>-e</code> for field selection, is crucial for threat intelligence because it structures TShark's output into machine-readable formats like CSV or JSON. This structured data can be easily ingested by SIEMs, threat intelligence platforms, or custom scripts for automated correlation, enrichment, and analysis of indicators of compromise.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors misattribute capabilities to options for real-time capture, display filtering, or two-pass analysis, failing to recognize the core function of <code>-T fields -e</code> in preparing data for automated security workflows.",
        "analogy": "Using <code>-T fields -e</code> is like exporting specific columns from a database into a CSV file, making it easy to import that data into a spreadsheet or another database for analysis."
