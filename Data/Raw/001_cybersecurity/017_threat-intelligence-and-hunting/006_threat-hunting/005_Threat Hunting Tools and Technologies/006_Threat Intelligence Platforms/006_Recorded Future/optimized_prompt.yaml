active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the pros and cons of relying on Recorded Future's automated threat intelligence (e.g., Autonomous
    Threat Operations) versus manual threat hunting. How does it impact response times, accuracy, and false positives in real-world
    scenarios like ransomware campaigns? Support with examples from Recorded Future case studies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

      IOCs with TTPs), 1 unrelated but thematic (e.g., another cybersecurity term).'
    - Avoid 'all/none' options; ensure single correct answer.
    - 'Base on real-world errors: e.g., for Recorded Future integration, distractor ''manual CSV export'' vs. correct ''Connect
      API''.'

  Topic: Recorded Future (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > 011_Threat Hunting > 011_004_Threat
  Hunting Tools and Technologies > Threat Intelligence Platforms > Recorded Future). Use the provided research context, complete
  truncated sections (e.g., Autonomous Threat Operations: automates threat prioritization, enrichment, and response; Insikt
  Group: research arm; Connect API: 100+ integrations), voter suggestions (add case studies like ransomware hunts, link to
  IOCs/TTPs), and pedagogical elements below.
