active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a resource-constrained organization, should you prioritize technical feeds (IoCs) or tactical feeds
    (TTPs) for threat hunting? Debate with evidence from real-world examples (e.g., WannaCry IoC blocking vs. MITRE ATT&CK
    TTP mapping), considering integration challenges, false positive rates, and long-term efficacy.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema. Cover all content comprehensively, drawing from this synthesized
  knowledge base:


  [Insert full scaffolding layers here verbatim].


  Incorporate research: TI definitions from CrowdStrike/Wiz/TechTarget; Types: Technical (IoCs: IPs/hashes/domains), Tactical
  (TTPs), Operational (campaigns), Strategic (trends); Tools: MISP, ThreatConnect, SIEM (Splunk/ELK), SOAR/EDR; Best practices:
  API ingestion, STIX/TAXII, false positive mitigation; Examples: Ransomware IoCs, SolarWinds TTPs.


  Align to Bloom''s objectives: [Insert learning_objectives array here].


  Embed active learning hooks: Reference discussion on Technical vs. Tactical prioritization, peer teaching on feed types,
  problem-solving with sample JSON.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as: {''front'': ''question text'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'', ''opt3''] (if MCQ), ''bloom_level'': ''Apply (Layer 3)'', ''scaffolding_layer'':
  ''Layer 3 Implementation''}}.


  Ensure pedagogical best practices: Active recall, spaced repetition friendly, distractors from common errors (e.g., confusing
  feed types, ignoring false positives).'
