active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a scenario where traditional disk forensics fails to detect an APT, debate how Volatility 3's memory
    layers could reveal hidden processes and network connections that evade detection, citing real-world examples like SolarWinds.
    Discuss limitations of non-volatile analysis and when to prioritize memory dumps.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., Volatility 2 vs 3 differences), 2)
    Plausible but incorrect from lower layer (e.g., disk artifact), 3) Edge case or outdated info (e.g., Volatility 2 plugin).
    Ensure 70% cards cover Layers 1-2 (foundation), 30% Layers 3-4 (advanced). Balance Bloom''s: 30% Remember/Understand,
    40% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate/Create.'
