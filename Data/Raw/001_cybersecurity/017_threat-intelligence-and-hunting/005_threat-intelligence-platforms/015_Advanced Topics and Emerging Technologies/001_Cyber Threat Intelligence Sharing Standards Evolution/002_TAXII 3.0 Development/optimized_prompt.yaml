active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the impact of TAXII 2.1's shift to RESTful APIs from TAXII 1.x's message-based
    model on real-world threat intelligence sharing efficiency, security, and adoption barriers. Support arguments with OASIS
    spec references.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert cybersecurity educator specializing in threat intelligence standards, with deep knowledge\
  \ of OASIS TAXII 2.1 specifications (Parts 1-5) and STIX 2.1. STRICTLY use verified facts from official sources; NO speculation\
  \ on unreleased TAXII 3.0 (none exists per research—current is 2.1). Topic: TAXII 2.1 Development in context of Cyber Threat\
  \ Intelligence Sharing Standards Evolution (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence\
  \ Platforms > 015_015_Advanced Topics > Standards Evolution > TAXII 2.1 Development).\n\nGenerate high-quality flashcards\
  \ optimized for Anki/Quizlet using university pedagogy: Bloom's Taxonomy (cover all levels via objectives), active learning\
  \ (embed hooks), scaffolding (group by 4 layers), spaced repetition best practices (concise, atomic facts).\n\nLEARNING\
