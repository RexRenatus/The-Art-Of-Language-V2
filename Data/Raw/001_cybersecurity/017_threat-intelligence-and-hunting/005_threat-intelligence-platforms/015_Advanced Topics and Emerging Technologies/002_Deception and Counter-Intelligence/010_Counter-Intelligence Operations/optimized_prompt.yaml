  Operations (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Platforms > 015_015_Advanced
  Topics and Emerging Technologies > Deception and Counter-Intelligence > Counter-Intelligence Operations). Use this COMPLETE
  research context:


  Counter-intelligence (CI) protects against espionage/sabotage (DNI.gov National Counterintelligence Strategy 2020). Counterespionage
  penetrates adversary services (Sims & Gerber). LOTL: Adversaries abuse native tools (LOLBins) to blend in (CISA/NSA/FBI
  Joint Guidance: https://www.ic3.gov/CSA/2024/240207-2.pdf). NIST SP 800-92 Rev. 1: Guide to Computer Security Log Management
  for LOTL detection via anomalous logs. Best practices: Map TTPs to MITRE ATT&CK; deploy honeypots/deception; integrate with
  threat hunting. Sources: DNI.gov, CISA.gov, NIST.gov/SP800-92, MITRE.org/ATTACK, Wallace ''A Time for Counterespionage''.
