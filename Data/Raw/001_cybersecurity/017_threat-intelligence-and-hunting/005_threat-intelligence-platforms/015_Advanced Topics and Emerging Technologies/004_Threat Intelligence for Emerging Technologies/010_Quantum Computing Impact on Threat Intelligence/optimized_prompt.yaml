active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In pairs, debate whether organizations should prioritize implementing quantum-safe cryptography in threat
    intelligence platforms now or wait for concrete evidence of a CRQC. Cite specific implications for 'Harvest Now, Decrypt
    Later' attacks and adversary TTPs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Content Context (Completed and Comprehensive):**

  Quantum Computing leverages superposition/entanglement for speedups. CRQC (10-20 years away) breaks RSA/ECC via Shor''s
  algorithm, AES via Grover''s. Impacts on TI: 1. ''Harvest Now, Decrypt Later'' compromises historical data; 2. Undermines
  CIA triad; 3. New Challenges: PQC migration (NIST standards like Kyber), adversary quantum adoption (faster TTP discovery),
  quantum-enhanced threats. Sources: gao.gov, nist.gov/nvlpubs, researchgate.net, cloudsecurityalliance.org.


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the 6 objectives above].

  - Scaffolding: Strictly layer flashcards (5-8 per layer).

  - Active Learning Tie-in: Flashcards should prompt higher-order thinking (e.g., ''Evaluate this strategy...'').


  **Generate 25 flashcards using the exact schema:**
