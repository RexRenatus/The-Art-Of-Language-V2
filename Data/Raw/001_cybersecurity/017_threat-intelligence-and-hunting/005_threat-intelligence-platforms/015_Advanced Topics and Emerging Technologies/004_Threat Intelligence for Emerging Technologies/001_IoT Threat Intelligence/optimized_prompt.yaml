active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of IoT proliferation, debate whether threat intelligence platforms can keep pace with
    the expanding attack surface posed by billions of devices. Use real-world examples like the Mirai botnet to support arguments
    on proactive hunting vs. reactive measures.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., ''weak password'' as IoC vs. indicator), 2) Oversimplify TTPs (e.g., ignore procedures), 3) Misapply frameworks
    (e.g., NIST Detect as only for traditional IT). Ensure distractors are realistic from voter/research context.'
