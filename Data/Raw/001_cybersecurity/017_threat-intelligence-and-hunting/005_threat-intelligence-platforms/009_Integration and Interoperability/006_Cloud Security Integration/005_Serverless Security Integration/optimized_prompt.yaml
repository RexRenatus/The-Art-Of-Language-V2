  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the trade-offs of serverless security integration: ''Does the reduced operational overhead of
    serverless computing outweigh the unique challenges in threat hunting, such as ephemeral executions? Provide evidence
    from MITRE ATT&CK or OWASP.'' Encourage critical thinking by requiring citations from research context.'

  **Completed Research Context:**

  Serverless computing offers significant advantages... [full provided context].

  ### Core Concepts and Definitions [as given].

  ### Industry Standards and Frameworks

  - **MITRE ATT&CK for Cloud:** Maps adversary TTPs to cloud resources, including serverless (e.g., TA0002 Execution via functions).

  - **OWASP Serverless Top 10:** Risks like S10:10 Insecure Input Validation, S10:07 Vulnerable Deployments.

  - **AWS Well-Architected Framework:** Security Pillar covers IAM least privilege, secure coding for Lambda.

  - **AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF):** Provides blueprints for security integration during cloud migration, emphasizing
  people, process, and technology lenses (e.g., Security Perspective: Identity management, data protection, threat detection).

  **Sources:** AWS Security Blog (Serverless Security Best Practices), OWASP.org/serverless-top-10, MITRE.org/attack/cloud,
  AWS Well-Architected docs, AWS CAF Whitepaper.
