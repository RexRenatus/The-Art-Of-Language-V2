active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges of integrating SentinelOne with legacy SIEM systems like
    older Splunk versions (e.g., API compatibility issues, data volume overload). Propose three mitigation strategies and
    vote on the most feasible one, justifying with real-world examples from documentation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol:
    principles: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse Agent Data with Alerts), 2) Partial
      truth (e.g., correct step but wrong order/platform), 3) Plausible opposite (e.g., ''No API token needed'' vs. required).
      Base on voter-noted errors (truncations, incomplete integrations) and real pitfalls (field mapping mismatches). Ensure
      1 correct option is unambiguous.'
    examples:
      misconception: Alerts include only endpoint status (wrong; that's Agent Data).
      partial: 'Step 1: Map fields (wrong order; first generate token).'
      opposite: Integration skips testing (wrong; essential for validation).
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in SentinelOne Integration
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Platforms > 009_Integration and
  Interoperability > Endpoint Security Integration > SentinelOne Integration). Use the provided Learning Objectives, Active
  Learning activities, Scaffolding Layers (1-4), and Flashcard Schema to create optimized Anki-style flashcards.


  **Content Base:** Incorporate this complete, web-grounded research (sources: elastic.co/guide/en/integrations/current/sentinel_one.html,
  SentinelOne docs, Splunk/Sophos/Cortex integrations):

  - Core: SentinelOne (AI endpoint security); Integration for threat intel/hunting.

  - Data: Agent (status/activity), Alerts/Threats (MITRE, severity), App Risk/Vuln (CVEs, scores).

  - Examples: Elastic (ingest via module), Splunk (HEC), Cortex/Sophos (SOAR workflows).

  - Concept Map: ''SentinelOne Integration'' → Data Types → Platforms → Processes.


  **Instructions:**

  1. Cover all 6 Learning Objectives and 4 Scaffolding Layers evenly.

  2. Embed active learning: 10% flashcards as ''Apply Discussion'' (e.g., ''Propose solution to: [scenario]'').

  3. Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: Front/Back structure, distractors per protocol.

  4. Ensure pedagogy: Bloom''s alignment, scaffolding progression, measurable verbs.

  5. Output 60 flashcards in JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'':
  ''...'', ''layer'': ''...'', ''related_objective'': ''...'', ''concept_map_link'': ''...''}}, ...].

  6. Voter Priorities: Emphasize completeness (full App Risk/Vuln defs, all integrations w/ workflows); no truncations.


  Generate now, ensuring high retention via spaced repetition best practices (active recall, explanations).'
