active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a scenario where your organization's SIEM is overwhelmed with false positives from IOC feeds, debate
    the trade-offs between using standardized formats like STIX/TAXII versus proprietary feeds. What factors (e.g., interoperability,
    update speed, accuracy) should guide the choice? Consider prerequisites like IOCs from Threat Detection 101, SIEM basics
    from Security Operations, and Threat Feeds from Intelligence Platforms.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Plausible but incorrect: e.g., Confuse STIX (content) with TAXII (transport).'
    - 'Common misconceptions: e.g., ''IOC export is always real-time without config'' vs. ''Requires API polling and validation''.'
    - 'Edge cases: e.g., Proprietary formats as ''more secure'' than STIX.'
    - 'Variety: 1 semantic error, 1 overgeneralization, 1 unrelated term.'
    count: Always 3 distractors, randomized order with correct not first.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education on ''IOC Feed Export to SIEM'' (Category:
  Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Platforms > 009_Integration and Interoperability >
  SIEM Integration > IOC Feed Export to SIEM). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives, active learning (discussion/peer
  teaching/problem-solving), scaffolding layers (Foundation: basics/prerequisites; Components: STIX/TAXII standards; Implementation:
  tools/APIs; Integration: challenges/best practices), voter consensus (82.9% approval).


  Prior Knowledge: IOCs (Threat Detection 101), SIEM basics (Security Operations), Threat Feeds (Intelligence Platforms).


  Content Sources: IOCs (IPs/hashes/domains), SIEM (log aggregation), feeds (real-time threats), standards (STIX 2.1 JSON
  IOCs, TAXII transport, MITRE ATT&CK, JSON/XML), tools (Splunk ES, QRadar, ELK), best practices (validate IOCs, false positives,
  real-time APIs), challenges (overload, formats).


  Learning Objectives: [Insert the 6 objectives from above].


  Active Learning Tie-Ins: Reference discussion (STIX vs proprietary trade-offs), peer teaching (export steps), problem-solving
  (troubleshoot false positives).


  Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [Insert layer descriptions].
