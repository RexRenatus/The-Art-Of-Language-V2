active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages and limitations of Elastic SIEM's open-source model for
    threat intelligence integration compared to proprietary SIEMs. Support your points with examples from real-world breaches
    (e.g., SolarWinds) and reference Elastic's scalability features.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 1 extreme/oversimplified (e.g., ''SIEM replaces firewalls''). Ensure distractors use similar terminology; avoid ''all/none''
    options.'
