active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the pros and cons of integrating Nessus vulnerability data into threat intelligence platforms
    for proactive hunting. Use real-world examples like Log4Shell exploitation to argue if it enhances or complicates threat
    response. Consider factors such as data volume, false positives, and response time.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (2) Based on real pitfalls (e.g., ignoring false positives), (3) Drawn from related concepts (e.g., threat intel vs. vuln
    mgmt), (4) Plausible to 20-30% of learners. Ensure one distractor is a ''trap'' from partial knowledge.'

  **Completed Research Context (Expanded for Completeness):**

  Nessus (Tenable) scans for vulnerabilities. Integration via APIs/connectors into Tenable Exposure Management Platform or
  third-parties (SIEMs like Splunk/ELK, threat intel tools). Key: Export JSON/XML scans, normalize data (CVSS, plugins). Prioritizing
  Targets: Focus on assets most likely exploited (high CVSS + internet-facing + threat intel matches, e.g., Log4Shell on Log4j
  apps). Leveraging for Hunting: Correlate vulns with logs/behavioral indicators; automate alerts. Best Practices: Schedule
  scans, deduplicate, integrate with MITRE ATT&CK. Examples: Tenable case studies on rapid Log4Shell response. Sources: Tenable

  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives from above].

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers from above].

  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Ensure flashcards support discussion (pros/cons), peer teaching (steps), problem-solving (scenarios).

  **Prior Knowledge:** Assumes Nmap basics, MITRE ATT&CK.


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (10 per Bloom''s level where possible, balanced across layers). Cover all objectives,
  layers, and research. Vary formats: 40% Q&A/cloze, 40% MCQ, 20% scenario.
