active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of integrating ThreatConnect with Recorded Future versus
    Splunk for proactive threat hunting. Consider factors like data enrichment speed, cost, and real-world SOC scalability,
    citing specific functionalities from each integration.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    with SIEM (e.g., ''ThreatConnect is a log aggregator''); (2) Misstate integration purpose (e.g., ''Splunk integration
    only for visualization, not IOC export''); (3) Overgeneralize (e.g., ''All SOAR integrations are plug-and-play without
    API keys''); (4) Partial truths (e.g., ''Recorded Future provides IOCs but not TTPs''). Ensure distractors are plausible
    and derived from research context.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Threat Intelligence Platforms.
  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on ''ThreatConnect Integration'' (Category: Cybersecurity; Domain: Threat Intelligence
  And Hunting; Subdomain: Threat Intelligence Platforms; Entry Domain: 009_Integration and Interoperability; Entry Subdomain:
  SOAR Integration; Level 6: ThreatConnect Integration).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active learning: Tie cards to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving where relevant.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers – 6-7 per layer: Layer 1 Foundation (terms, prerequisites like IOCs/TTPs/SOAR);
  Layer 2 Components (integrations: Recorded Future, Cortex XSOAR, Splunk, Elastic, ServiceNow, Polyswarm, Microsoft Copilot);
  Layer 3 Implementation (configs, APIs); Layer 4 Integration (comparisons, workflows, SOC apps, links to MISP/Anomali/DevOps).

  - Voter consensus: Emphasize completeness (full integrations list with functions), pedagogy (Bloom''s, misconceptions like
  TIP=SIEM), connections (cross-links).

  - Research: TIP aggregates IOCs/TTPs; supports threat hunting, case mgmt; integrations enable SOAR interoperability.


  Use exact flashcard schema: [INSERT FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Output ONLY a JSON array of objects, each: {''type'': ''Q&A|MCQ|Cloze'',
  ''bloom_level'': ''Remember|etc.'', ''scaffolding_layer'': 1-4, ''front'': ''text'', ''back'': ''text'', ''tags'': [''integration:RecordedFuture'',
  etc.]}. Ensure variety, no duplicates, optimized for Anki/Quizlet (spaced repetition friendly).'
