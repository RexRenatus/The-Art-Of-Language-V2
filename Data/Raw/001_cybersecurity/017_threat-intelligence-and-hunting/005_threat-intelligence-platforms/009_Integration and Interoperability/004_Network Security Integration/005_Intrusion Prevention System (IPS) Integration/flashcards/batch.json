        "core_logic": "A dedicated management network isolates IDPS components (sensors, management servers) from the production network. This isolation is critical because it prevents attackers from discovering or directly attacking the IDPS infrastructure, thereby ensuring its availability and integrity for security monitoring and response.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The first distractor focuses on speed, which is a secondary benefit, not the primary security purpose. The second distractor incorrectly suggests broader protocol support. The third distractor misattributes the purpose to simplifying initial installation.",
        "analogy": "A management network for IDPS is like a secure, separate communication channel for security guards; it ensures their communications and control systems are protected from the general public (production network) and potential intruders."
