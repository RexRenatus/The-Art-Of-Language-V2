active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of deploying network-based IPS versus host-based IPS in
    a cloud-hybrid environment. Consider factors like visibility into encrypted traffic, scalability, and false positive rates.
    Support arguments with NIST SP 800-94 guidelines and real-world examples like the Equifax breach.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MC card: (1) Common misconception (e.g., ''IPS blocks all encrypted
    threats'' for NIDPS limitation), (2) Partial truth/mix-up (e.g., host-based feature attributed to network-based), (3)
    Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Zero false positives possible''). Ensure distractors are realistic based on research
    context and voter-noted pitfalls.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Intrusion Prevention System
  (IPS) Integration (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Platforms > 009_Integration
  and Interoperability > 003_Network Security Integration > Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) Integration).


  Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema: {''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''distractors'': [''...'', ''...'', ''...'']}}. Cover all learning objectives (REMEMBER: define/list types; UNDERSTAND:
  explain needs/limitations; APPLY: steps; ANALYZE: compare; EVALUATE: critique; CREATE: design) and 4 scaffolding layers
  proportionally.


  Content must be grounded in research: NIST SP 800-94 (IDPS defs), RFC 9424 (IoCs), MITRE ATT&CK (TTPs). Include all IDPS
  types (NIDPS: network traffic, limitations-encrypted blind; HIDPS: host agents, resource-heavy; WIDPS: wireless, spectrum-limited;
  NBA: anomalies, low-volume misses). Integration: SIEM/SOAR APIs, threat feeds, tuning, metrics. Case studies (Equifax),
  misconceptions (no zero FPs).


  Incorporate active learning: Tie explanations to discussions (e.g., trade-offs), peer teaching (steps), problem-solving
  (scenarios).


  Follow flashcard schema strictly: Varied Q types, precise distractors (misconceptions/partial truths/extremes), rich explanations
  with sources/Bloom''s/scaffolding ties. Ensure university-level pedagogy: progressive complexity, measurable verbs, no fluff.'
