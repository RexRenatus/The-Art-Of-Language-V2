    common misconceptions like ''WAF replaces secure coding''? Use real-world examples like the Capital One breach to support
    your arguments.'

    SNMP instead of REST APIs''). Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter-noted errors and research (e.g., confusing
    WAF with network firewalls).'

  \nGenerate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for university-level pedagogy using Bloom's Taxonomy. Distribute across\

  \ research context: WAF (Layer 7, blocks OWASP Top 10), threat intel (IoCs/TTPs), best practices (SIEM/SOAR integration,\
  \ NIST logging, rule tuning). Include real-world examples (Capital One breach), misconceptions (WAF ≠ secure coding replacement).\n\
