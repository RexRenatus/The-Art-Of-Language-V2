active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent does the DHS Cyber Threat Information Sharing Framework balance the need for rapid cyber
    threat information sharing with privacy and competitive concerns for critical infrastructure owners? Use examples from
    recent cyber incidents (e.g., Colonial Pipeline ransomware) to debate pros, cons, and potential improvements.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs: Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse ''Cyber Threat
    Indicator'' with ''IOC'' without DHS context; mix privacy rules; use similar frameworks like NIPP). Ensure distractors
    are realistic (e.g., from related terms like TTPs, vulnerabilities) but incorrect; label correct answer clearly.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in the DHS Cyber Threat Information
  Sharing Framework (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Platforms > 003_Frameworks
  and Methodologies > Standardized Frameworks > DHS Cyber Threat Information Sharing Framework).


  Generate 25-30 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema. Ensure coverage of:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert full layers above], with 6-8 cards per layer.

  - Active Learning: Incorporate elements (e.g., scenario questions from problem-solving, comparison prompts from discussion).

  - Research Context: Ground in DHS/CISA: Critical Infrastructure (vital sectors); Cyber Threat Indicator (malicious recon/vulns);
  Defensive Measure (mitigations); Cybersecurity Purpose (protection). Entities: CISA, AIS, ISACs. Processes: Anonymized sharing
  for collective defense. Links: NIPP, PPD-21, National Cyber Strategy. Sources: https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/critical-infrastructure-threat-information-sharing-framework;
