active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the strengths and weaknesses of STRIDE versus PASTA for threat modeling a cloud-based SaaS application.
    Which methodology would you choose for a startup versus a large enterprise, and why? Support your arguments with examples
    from OWASP resources.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    from research (e.g., real but incorrect methods like ''CIA Triad'' as threat model). 3. Vary difficulty: easy (obvious
    wrong), medium (partial truth), hard (contextual trap). 4. No more than 4 options total.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in OWASP Threat Modeling (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Platforms > 003_Frameworks and Methodologies
  > Standardized Frameworks > OWASP 005_Threat Modeling). Voter consensus: 82.9% approval on completeness and pedagogy enhancements.


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (20 MCQ, 20 cloze, 10 Q&A) covering all Bloom''s levels, active learning concepts, and
  4 scaffolding layers. Ensure even distribution: ~20% per layer, spanning objectives.


  Incorporate:

  - Research context: OWASP''s 4 key questions, STRIDE/PASTA, Threat Dragon, NIST SP 800-30 integration.

  - Active learning: Embed discussion/debate elements, peer teach-back, problem-solving scenarios (e.g., mobile banking app).

  - Scaffolding: Tag each card to a layer.

  - Prerequisites: Link to NIST/basic frameworks.

  - Concept map: Use in explanations (e.g., ''Branches from central OWASP node'').


  Follow exact flashcard_schema:

  Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''opt1'',
  ''opt2'', ''opt3'']}, ''metadata'': {...}}, ...]


  Prioritize: Completeness (full sources/URLs), measurable objectives, critical thinking via distractors/exercises. Make explanations
  pedagogical with examples, avoiding overload.'
