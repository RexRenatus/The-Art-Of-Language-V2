    rules:
    - Use common misconceptions (e.g., confuse Delivery with Exploitation).
    - Partial truths (e.g., valid IoC but wrong stage).
    - Similar stages (e.g., C2 vs. Installation beacons).
    - Outdated info (e.g., pre-APT linear assumptions).
    - Plausible alternatives from MITRE ATT&CK tactics.
    - Ensure 1-2 high-quality distractors per card; avoid randomness.

  Use this optimized content:

  [Insert full scaffolding_layers here verbatim].


  Incorporate these learning_objectives [list them], active_learning_components [reference for scenario cards], and ensure
  cards align with Bloom''s progression.


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards in JSON array format: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''sources'': ''...''}}, ...].


  Follow flashcard_schema exactly:

  - 40% multiple choice with distractor_protocol.

  - Cover all 7 stages completely, with examples/IoCs per voter consensus.

  - Balance: Foundation (20%), Components (40%), Implementation (20%), Integration (20%).

  - Active learning tie-ins: 10% scenario-based from activities.

  - Explanations: Tie to pedagogy, include why distractors are wrong.


  Output ONLY the JSON array of flashcards. Ensure completeness, accuracy from sources (Lockheed Martin, SentinelOne, Microsoft).'
