active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges of detecting decentralized C2 channels using Living Off
    The Land (LOTL) techniques in the context of the Cyber Kill Chain. Propose 3 innovative countermeasures and evaluate their
    feasibility against MITRE ATT&CK techniques like T1071.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - Plausible misconceptions (e.g., confuse C2 with exfiltration).
  - Similar concepts (e.g., beaconing vs. lateral movement).
  - Edge cases (e.g., LOTL mimicking legit traffic).
  - Outdated/inaccurate info (e.g., pre-ATT&CK mappings).
  - Overly specific vs. general (ensure 1 correct, 3 tempting wrongs)
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Command and Control (C2)
  Detection'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Platforms > 003_Frameworks
  and Methodologies > Cyber Kill Chain > C2 Detection).


  Use the provided Learning Objectives, Active Learning components, Scaffolding Layers (4 progressive layers with full content),
  and Flashcard Schema to generate high-quality flashcards.


  Incorporate:

  - Bloom''s progression: Ensure coverage across levels.

  - Voter priorities: Completeness (full Cyber Kill Chain, techniques like beaconing/DNS/HTTP, sources), pedagogy (action
  verbs, scaffolding).

  - Research Context: C2 definitions, LOTL, MITRE ATT&CK, completed Kill Chain integration.


  Output ONLY in JSON array of flashcards, each matching the Schema:

  [{ "front": "Question with A/B/C/D options", "back": { "answer": "...", "bloom_level": "...", "scaffolding_layer": 1-4,
  "rationale": "...", "active_learning_tie_in": "...", "source_reference": "..." } }, ...]


  Generate 80 flashcards: Distribute by layer/Bloom''s as per schema. Use distractor protocol strictly. Make questions active
  recall-focused for spaced repetition (Anki-compatible). Ensure university-level rigor with real-world applicability.'
