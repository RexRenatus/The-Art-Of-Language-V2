active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether the Cyber Kill Chain model is still relevant in 2024 given alternatives
    like MITRE ATT&CK. Provide examples of gaps it identifies uniquely and discuss how it complements threat hunting.
  peer_teaching: Pair students; one teaches a specific CKC stage (e.g., Command and Control) including common defensive gaps
    and mitigations, while the partner quizzes them and teaches back another stage. Switch roles to enhance retention and
    understanding.
  problem_solving: Using the Colonial Pipeline breach case study, students map the attack to CKC stages, perform a gap analysis
    on hypothetical defender controls, propose mitigations, and present findings. Incorporate threat intelligence data for
    realism.
