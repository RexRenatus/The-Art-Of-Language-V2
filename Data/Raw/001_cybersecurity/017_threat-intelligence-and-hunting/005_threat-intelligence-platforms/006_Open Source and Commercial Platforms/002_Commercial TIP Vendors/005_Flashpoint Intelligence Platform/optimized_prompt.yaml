  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how Flashpoint's focus on Primary Source Collection (PSC) from closed sources
    like private forums and Telegram enhances proactive threat hunting compared to relying solely on OSINT. Provide examples
    of TTPs or IOCs that could be uncovered exclusively via Flashpoint.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Threat Intelligence Platforms.
  Use the following to create 25 high-quality flashcards on the ''Flashpoint Intelligence Platform'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Platforms > 006_Open Source and Commercial Platforms > Commercial
  TIP Vendors > Flashpoint Intelligence Platform).


  **Completed Research Context** (expanded for completeness): Flashpoint is a commercial TIP providing actionable TI from
  illicit communities, chat (e.g., Telegram), open web, technical data. Key: TI (knowledge on threats/TTPs); CTI (digital
  subset); External TI (OSINT + deep/dark web); PSC (direct collection from closed sources per business needs); Threat Actors
  (malicious groups); IOCs (artifacts like IPs, hashes, domains). Capabilities: Data collection/analysis, finished intelligence,
  CTI organization (TTP/actor mapping), querying/alerting, reports. Integrates via APIs. Sources: flashpoint.io, cybersecurity
  blogs (e.g., Dark Reading), vendor datasheets.


  **Pedagogy**: Align to these Bloom''s objectives: [insert learning_objectives array]. Structure via scaffolding: [insert
  scaffolding object].


  **Active Learning Tie-In**: Flashcards should prompt reflection on discussion/activities, e.g., ''How does this apply to
  the ransomware scenario?''


  **Output Format**: JSON array of objects matching flashcard_schema. Exactly 25 cards, diverse types, balanced levels/layers.
  No extras.'
