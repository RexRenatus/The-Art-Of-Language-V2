active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the misconception that threat intelligence is solely about IOC lists versus
    Recorded Future's contextual analysis via the Intelligence Graph®. Provide examples of how contextual insights (e.g.,
    attacker motivations) lead to better prioritization than raw IOCs alone. Link to real-world breaches like SolarWinds.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education on the ''Recorded Future Intelligence Platform''
  (Category: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Platforms > 006_Open Source and Commercial
  Platforms > Commercial TIP Vendors > Recorded Future Intelligence Platform).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Active Learning: Use for context in explanations (e.g., ''As in peer teaching...'').

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers – 5-8 per layer (Layer 1: Foundation, Layer 2: Components, Layer 3:
  Implementation, Layer 4: Integration) [insert full scaffolding descriptions above]. Address misconceptions (threat intel
  ≠ IOCs only).

  - Topic Content: Threat Intelligence (contextual analysis), Intelligence Graph® (AI from 1M+ sources), Autonomous Threat
  Ops. Integrations: SIEM/SOAR/EDR. Aligns NIST CSF (Identify/Protect), ISO 27001. Best Practices: Onboard via API, query
  risks, auto-enrich alerts, validate telemetry, custom ML. Comparisons: Superior graph vs. ThreatConnect playbooks, Mandiant
  investigations, CrowdStrike EDR. Sources: https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform, https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/intelligence-graph,
