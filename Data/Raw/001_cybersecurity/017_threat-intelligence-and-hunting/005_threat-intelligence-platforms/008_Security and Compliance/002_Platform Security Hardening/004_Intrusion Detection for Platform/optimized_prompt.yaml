active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the strengths and limitations of signature-based vs. anomaly-based IDS
    in threat intelligence platforms. Use real-world examples like SolarWinds breach to support arguments and relate to MITRE
    ATT&CK TTPs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., confuse IOCs with
    TTPs); 2) Partial truths (e.g., signature-based as ''always better than anomaly''); 3) Edge cases (e.g., outdated standards);
    4) Voter-suggested gaps (e.g., incomplete MITRE descriptions). Ensure distractors promote analysis.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Intrusion Detection for
  Platform'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Platforms > 008_Security
  and Compliance > Platform Security Hardening > Intrusion Detection for Platform). Use the provided learning objectives,
  active learning activities, scaffolding layers (Foundation, Components, Implementation, Integration), and flashcard schema
  to generate 50 high-quality flashcards (15 Basic Q&A, 20 Multiple Choice, 15 Scenario-Based) spanning all Bloom''s levels
  and layers.


  Incorporate research context: Intrusion Detection (signature/anomaly-based), Threat Hunting (proactive), CTI, IOCs/IOAs,
  TTPs, MITRE ATT&CK, SIEM (Splunk, ELK), NIST SP 800-94. Use voter consensus: 82.9% approval, complete truncated sections
  with real-world examples.


  Textual concept map for context: ''Intrusion Detection for Platform'' (central) ↔ ''Threat Hunting'' ↔ ''CTI'' ↔ ''MITRE
  ATT&CK (TTPs)'' ↔ ''IOCs/IOAs'' ↔ ''SIEM Platforms (Splunk/ELK)''.


  Output ONLY in JSON array of flashcards, each as: {''type'': ''Basic/MC/Scenario'', ''front'': ''text'', ''back'': ''text'',
  ''blooms_level'': ''REMEMBER/etc'', ''layer'': 1-4}.


  Ensure pedagogical best practices: Scaffolding progression, active recall, spaced repetition-friendly, distractors per protocol.
  Promote university-style learning with ties to objectives/activities.'
