active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a low-risk data breach affecting PII of 5,000 customers (e.g., names and emails only, no financial
    data), debate whether immediate notification is required. Compare legal mandates like GDPR's 72-hour rule versus U.S.
    state laws (e.g., risk-of-harm thresholds in California CCPA) with ethical factors such as preserving customer trust versus
    avoiding panic. Identify common misconceptions like 'all breaches require instant notification.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Data Breach Notification
  Procedures (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Security and Compliance > Privacy and Compliance > Data Breach Notification
  Procedures). Generate 30 high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized flashcards covering all Bloom''s levels and scaffolding
  layers.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the full array from ''learning_objectives'']

  - Active Learning Elements: Weave in discussion debates (e.g., low-risk notification ethics), peer teaching (regulation
  quizzes), Equifax problem-solving (flowcharts/timelines).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute evenly: 25% Layer 1 (definitions: data breach, PII), 25% Layer 2 (NIST SP 800-61 phases, regs:
  GDPR 72h, CCPA 60d, HIPAA), 25% Layer 3 (steps, templates, risk assessment), 25% Layer 4 (threat intel integration, Equifax/SolarWinds
  examples).

  - Research Context: NIST SP 800-61/122, DHS PII handling, GDPR Art 33/34, CCPA §1798.82, HIPAA Breach Notification Rule,
  47 U.S. states; goals: mitigate harm, comply, build trust.

  - Voter Consensus: 82.9% approval; emphasize global regs, misconceptions, SMART objectives.


  Use exact Flashcard Schema: [paste full schema]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 30 flashcards, e.g., [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'':
  ''...'', ...}]. Ensure variety, no duplicates, active recall focus (questions test application/analysis over rote).'
