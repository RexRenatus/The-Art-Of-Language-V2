If PII is incidentally collected during a malware hunt, its retention and use must be strictly assessed against the original hunt's purpose. If it doesn't align, it should be isolated and handled according to privacy policies, potentially requiring deletion or anonymization if no other legitimate purpose exists.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors suggest immediate deletion without assessment, continued use based on perceived relevance, or relying solely on anonymization, all of which fail to properly address the core requirement of assessing alignment with the original purpose before further processing.",
