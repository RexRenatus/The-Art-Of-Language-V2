active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between strict PCI-DSS compliance (e.g., Req 9 physical
    access controls) and the agility needed for rapid threat hunting in financial intelligence platforms. How can organizations
    balance these without compromising security? Support with real-world examples like carding market threats.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Use this optimized learning framework:


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s Taxonomy):** [Insert the ''learning_objectives'' array here verbatim].


  **Active Learning Components:** Incorporate ties to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving in explanations (e.g., ''Discuss
  in peer teaching: ...'').


  **Scaffolding Layers:** Distribute flashcards progressively: Layer 1 (20%), Layer 2 (25%), Layer 3 (30%), Layer 4 (25%).
  Tag each with layer.


  **Sources:** pcisecuritystandards.org (PCI-DSS v4 doc), PCI SSC Glossary. Complete 6 objectives/12 reqs as per research:
  [Insert full scaffolding Layer 2 here]. Big picture: PCI-DSS enables compliant threat hunting for financial intel (e.g.,
  carding TTPs).


  **Flashcard Generation Rules:**

  - Output ONLY JSON array of flashcards.

  - Schema: [{''id'':1, ''type'':''mcq/basic/cloze'', ''layer'':1-4, ''bloom'':''REMEMBER/etc'', ''front'':''...'', ''back'':''...'',
  ''explanation'':''...'', ''req_ref'':''Req X'', ''distractors'':[''A'',''B'',''C''] (for MCQ)}]

  - [Insert full ''flashcard_schema'' here verbatim].

  - Ensure voter priorities: Completeness (full 12 reqs), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression), concept map links, prerequisites
  (CIA triad tie-ins), 2-3 embedded MCQs as examples.

  - High-quality: Active recall, spaced repetition friendly, no hints in front.


  Generate 50 flashcards now.'
