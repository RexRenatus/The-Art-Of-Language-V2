active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the role of ISO 27001 certification in enhancing secure threat intelligence
    sharing across organizations. Consider pros (e.g., standardized risk management), cons (e.g., implementation costs), and
    real-world examples from threat hunting platforms. Synthesize group consensus on whether it should be mandatory for TI
    platforms.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  under the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Security and Compliance > Privacy and Compliance > ISO 27001 Certification.
  Note: This aligns better with Security/Compliance than Threat Intelligence Platforms, but integrate threat intel/hunting
  examples throughout.


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (balanced across Bloom''s levels: 20% REMEMBER, 20% UNDERSTAND, 20% APPLY, 20% ANALYZE,
  10% EVALUATE, 10% CREATE; and scaffolding layers: 25% each). Cover: CIA triad, 10 clauses of ISO 27001:2022, Annex A controls
  (focus threat-relevant like A.5.23, A.8.1), risk-based approach (identify/analyze/treat/monitor with TI examples), certification
  process (gap analysis, implementation, audits, transition to 2022 by Oct 2025), best practices, and integration with threat
  hunting platforms.


  Incorporate these learning objectives:

  Use scaffolding layers for progression:

  [Insert full scaffolding descriptions]


  Include active learning hooks in explanations (e.g., ''Discuss in peer teaching: ...'').


  Strictly follow this schema for each flashcard:

  [Insert full flashcard_schema details]


  Output as a numbered list of flashcards in JSON array format: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...''}, ...]. Ensure web-grounded
  accuracy from ISO/IEC 27001:2022 (sources: official ISO site, research on ISMS for TI). Vary question types (60% MCQ, 30%
  cloze, 10% short answer). Make engaging, precise, and pedagogically optimal.'
