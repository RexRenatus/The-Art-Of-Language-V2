active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of recent ransomware attacks (e.g., WannaCry or cases where backups were targeted), debate
    whether encrypted backup storage alone is sufficient for recovery, or if additional measures like air-gapping, immutability,
    and regular testing are essential. Support arguments with NIST SP 800-53 controls and threat intelligence on attacker
    TTPs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on voter-noted misconceptions/common errors: 1) Semantic
    confusion (e.g., ''symmetric'' vs. ''asymmetric''), 2) Overgeneralization (e.g., ''all encryption prevents ransomware''
    ignoring key theft), 3) Partial truth (e.g., ''full-disk only for OS, not backups''). Ensure distractors are realistic
    from research context (e.g., outdated standards) or real-world failures (e.g., untested restores).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards
  on ''Encrypted Backup Storage'' (Category: Cybersecurity, Domain: Threat Intelligence And Hunting, Subdomain: Threat Intelligence
  Platforms, Entry: 008_Security and Compliance > Data Security and Encryption). Use this topic hierarchy: Level1: Cybersecurity
  > Level2: Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Level3: Threat Intelligence Platforms > Level4: 008_Security and Compliance
  > Level5: Data Security and Encryption > Level6: Encrypted Backup Storage.


  Incorporate research context: Core concepts (backup, encryption, encrypted backup storage, ransomware, threat intel/hunting).
  Standards: NIST SP 800-111 (storage encryption: full-disk, file/folder, virtual disk for end-user devices), NIST SP 800-53
  (controls), NIST MSP guide (client-isolated keys, audits). Best practices: AES-256, HSM key mgmt, air-gapping, immutability,
  test restores. Examples: WannaCry ransomware targeting backups.


  Align with these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full array from above]

  - Active Learning: [insert full active_learning object from above]

  - Scaffolding: Generate cards balanced across 4 layers [insert full scaffolding array from above].


  Prior knowledge: Link to basics (file backups, sym/asym encryption, ransomware) with analogies (padlock on safe).


  Output 40-60 flashcards strictly in JSON array format, each following this schema: { ''type'': ''mcq'' or ''basic'' or ''cloze'',

  Flashcard rules: 60% MCQ with distractors (plausible via protocol: semantic confusion, overgeneralization, partial truths
  from misconceptions like untested encryption). 20% basic Q&A for definitions. 20% cloze for processes. Balance: 25% per
  layer, span all Bloom''s. Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition, scaffolding. Sources: NIST SP 800-111/53
