active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between reactive SIEM alerting and proactive SIEC-driven
    threat hunting. How does SIEC integration with frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK and NIST CSF reduce alert fatigue while enabling
    faster response times? Support your arguments with real-world examples from cybersecurity breaches.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate this full content context:

  - Foundation: Prior knowledge (logs, networking, SIEM basics). Definitions: SIEC (correlating events from logs/network/endpoint
  to detect patterns/threats), SIEM (collects/analyzes), Threat Intelligence (TTPs, IoCs like IPs/hashes), Hunting (proactive
  search).

  - Components: SIEM flow, MITRE ATT&CK (TTPs e.g., TA0008 Lateral Movement), NIST CSF (Detect/Respond), ISO 27001 (controls).

  - Implementation: Rules (e.g., ''IF suspicious IP + failed auth + process spawn THEN alert''), examples (Cobalt Strike:
  DNS anomalies + injection), challenges (noise, tuning), best practices (baselines, enrichment).

  - Integration: Platforms for hunting, reduces fatigue, proactive vs reactive.

  Sources: MITRE ATT&CK (attack.mitre.org), NIST SP 800-61/SP 800-53 (nist.gov), SANS SIEM papers.
