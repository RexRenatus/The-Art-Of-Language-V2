active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one learner explains CTI's role in a prevented incident scenario (e.g., using MITRE ATT&CK to map
    a neutralized phishing campaign), including cost avoidance calculation. Switch roles after 5 minutes and provide feedback
    on clarity and accuracy.
  problem_solving: 'Analyze a case study: A threat intelligence platform detects and prevents a ransomware attack (T1486 from
    MITRE ATT&CK). Compute ROI using FAIR (assume LEF=0.5/year, LEM=$2M) and average breach costs from Verizon DBIR ($4.45M).
    Discuss integration with organizational KPIs.'
