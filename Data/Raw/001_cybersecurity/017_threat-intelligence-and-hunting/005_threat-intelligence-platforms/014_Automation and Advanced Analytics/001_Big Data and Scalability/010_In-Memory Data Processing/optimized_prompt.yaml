  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the trade-offs of in-memory data processing in threat hunting: How does it balance speed gains
    against costs, volatility, and scalability limits? Use MITRE ATT&CK examples like rapid TTP correlation (e.g., memory
    injection detection) vs. resource constraints. Discuss misconceptions like ''faster is always better'' and reference prior
    knowledge from big data scalability.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Use this optimized learning prompt to generate high-quality flashcards:


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full learning_objectives array here]


  **Active Learning:** [Insert full active_learning object here]


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full scaffolding_layers array here]


  **Research Context:** In-memory data processing stores/manipulates data in RAM for speed in threat hunting: rapid correlation,
  anomaly detection, hypothesis testing (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK memory injection). Core: IMC, RAM volatility, throughput/latency.
  Tools: Redis, Spark. Trade-offs: speed vs. cost/volatility.


  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly follow [insert full flashcard_schema here]. Ensure progression: 30% Remember/Understand (Layer
  1-2), 40% Apply/Analyze (Layer 2-3), 30% Evaluate/Create (Layer 3-4). Incorporate concept map nodes, prerequisites, and
  completed MITRE examples.


  Generate 25 flashcards in JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}}, ...]. Vary question types (definition, scenario,
  comparison) for active recall. Output only the JSON array.'
