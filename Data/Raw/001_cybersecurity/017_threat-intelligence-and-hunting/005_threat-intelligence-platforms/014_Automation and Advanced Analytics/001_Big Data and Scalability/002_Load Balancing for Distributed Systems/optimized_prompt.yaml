active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how inadequate load balancing could lead to missed threats during a large-scale
    DDoS attack or surge in IoC data. Use real-world examples from threat intelligence platforms (e.g., SIEM overload) and
    propose mitigations, referencing AWS or Azure best practices.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 1. Use real-world errors (e.g., 'Round Robin always best' as distractor for dynamic loads). 2. Mirror
    correct answer structure but alter key fact (e.g., swap AWS/Azure). 3. Include cybersecurity red herrings (e.g., 'Encryption'
    instead of distribution). 4. Ensure 70% plausibility for active recall.
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for university-level cybersecurity education on 'Load Balancing for\
  \ Distributed Systems' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Platforms\
  \ > 014_Automation and Advanced Analytics > Big Data and Scalability > Load Balancing for Distributed Systems). Use Bloom's\
  \ Taxonomy progression, active learning hooks, and 4-layer scaffolding for optimal retention.\n\n**Content Sources & Context:**\n\
  - Core: Load balancing distributes traffic across servers for scalability/reliability in TIPs/SIEMs handling IoCs/TTPs.\n\
  - Big Picture: Vital for threat hunting (real-time scale; downtime misses threats). Analogy: Traffic lights for server load.\n\
  - Prior Knowledge: TCP/IP, distributed systems, Hadoop/Spark.\n- Layers: 1-Foundation (defs), 2-Components (types/algos/AWS-Azure\
  \ frameworks), 3-Implementation (setup steps), 4-Integration (auto-scale/ML).\n- Frameworks: AWS Well-Architected Reliability\
  \ (fault tolerance via ELB/ALB/NLB, health checks, multi-AZ); Azure Reliability (LB/Application Gateway, availability zones,\
  \ auto-scale).\n- Concept Map: Central 'Load Balancing' → Algorithms (RR, Least Conn), Types (L4/L7), Integration (SIEM/TIPs),\
  \ Dependencies (Monitoring/Auto-scale).\n- Examples: SIEM load during DDoS; MISP TIP scaling.\n- Sources: AWS Docs (https://aws.amazon.com/well-architected/reliability/),\
  \ Azure Framework (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/reliability/), NIST SP 800-61 (incident handling\
  \ scalability).\n\n**Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives from above].\n**Active Learning Ties:** Questions should\
  \ prompt discussion (e.g., 'Why evaluate...?'), peer teach (analogies), problem-solve (scenarios).\n\nGenerate 50 flashcards\
