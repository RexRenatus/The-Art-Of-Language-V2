active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the Pyramid of Pain model by debating which IoC types (e.g., IP addresses vs. TTPs) cause the
    most adversary pain. Justify your position using real-world examples from malware campaigns, such as DGA-based C2 communication
    in APT groups, and discuss implications for SOC workflows.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ cards: 1 primary correct answer; 3 distractors that are plausible based on common misconceptions
    (e.g., for Pyramid level of IPs: distractors like ''highest pain'' or ''TTP equivalent''). Draw from research context
    (e.g., confuse fragile IPs with painful TTPs), voter examples (DGA vs. benign), or standards (misattribute STIX to TAXII).
    Ensure distractors teach by contrast (e.g., ''IP address (low pain)'' vs. ''TTP (high pain)'').'
