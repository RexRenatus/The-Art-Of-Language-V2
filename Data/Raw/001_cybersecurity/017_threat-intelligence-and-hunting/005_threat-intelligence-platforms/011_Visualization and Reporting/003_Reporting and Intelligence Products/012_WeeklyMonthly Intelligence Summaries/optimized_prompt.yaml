active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In small groups, debate the trade-offs of brevity versus detail in weekly/monthly intelligence summaries
    when tailoring content for technical analysts versus executive leadership. Support arguments with examples from MITRE
    ATT&CK mappings or NIST CSF alignments, and propose best practices for audience adaptation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2. Similar but incorrect term (e.g., STIX vs. TAXII), 3. Outdated/irrelevant detail (e.g., weekly = strategic). Ensure
    one distractor is partially correct to test nuance. Balance 50% QA, 50% MCQ.'

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM JSON]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM JSON]

  - Active Learning: Reference in explanations where relevant.

  - Research Context: Draw from CTI definitions, frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK, STIX, NIST CSF), best practices (audience-tailored,
  actionable), and sources provided.


  Generate 40 high-quality flashcards (10 per scaffolding layer, balanced across Bloom''s levels: 20% Remember/Understand,
  40% Apply/Analyze, 40% Evaluate/Create). Cover all objectives, structures, examples, and integrations.


  Output EXCLUSIVELY as a JSON array of flashcards matching this schema: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD_SCHEMA FROM JSON].


  Ensure flashcards promote active recall: Varied formats (QA for definitions, MCQ for analysis), realistic examples, and
  distractors per protocol. Make content precise, educational, and grounded in voter consensus (e.g., progression, completeness).'
