  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for spaced repetition and active recall, covering these EXACT learning objectives:
  [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]. Incorporate active learning by including prompts inspired by: [INSERT active_learning_components
  ARRAY HERE]. Use 4-layer scaffolding: [INSERT scaffolding_layers ARRAY HERE].


  Context: Threat actor network graphs visualize relationships between actors, TTPs (MITRE ATT&CK), and infrastructure using
  nodes/edges. Key frameworks: MITRE ATT&CK (https://attack.mitre.org), Navigator (https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator),
  D3FEND (https://d3fend.mitre.org), STIX (https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation). Tools: Gephi, Cytoscape, Neo4j.
  Best practices: TTP-based hunting (proactive patterns vs. IOCs), ML clustering. Sources: MITRE ATT&CK, SANS Hunting Guides
  (https://www.sans.org/blog).


  Follow this EXACT schema for each flashcard: [INSERT flashcard_generation_schema HERE]. Ensure 40% MCQs with distractors
  per protocol. Balance coverage: Align 1/6 to each objective, distribute across layers. Promote prior knowledge links (graph
  theory, cyber basics). Make explanations assessable and tied to big picture (threat hunting workflows).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 50 flashcards.'
