Visualizing this chain allows analysts to see how different activities unfold chronologically, identify patterns, and understand the progression of a compromise. This is because the temporal aspect of visualization maps directly onto the sequential nature of an attack chain, enabling a clearer understanding of adversary methodology. This functions by mapping discrete events onto a timeline to show causality and progression.",
