  Incorporate these exactly:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use elements in explanations (e.g., reference discussion risks).

  - Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL 4 LAYERS FROM ABOVE] – Assign each flashcard to one layer.

  - Sources: Always cite (CISA: https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts.xml, AlienVault OTX: https://otx.alienvault.com/,
  MITRE ATT&CK: https://attack.mitre.org/, STIX 2.1: https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/os/stix-v2.1-os.html, NIST
  CSF: https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework, feedparser: https://feedparser.readthedocs.io/).


  Generate a JSON array of 25 flashcards following this EXACT schema per card: {"question": "...", "correct_answer": "...",
  "distractors": [{"text": "...", "explanation": "..."}, ... (EXACTLY 3)], "bloom_level": "REMEMBER|UNDERSTAND|APPLY|ANALYZE|EVALUATE|CREATE",
  "scaffolding_layer": "Foundation|Components|Implementation|Integration", "explanation": "...", "source": "..."}.


  Balance: 4-5 cards per Bloom''s level, 6-7 per layer. Questions progress Bloom''s Taxonomy. Make applied cards use real
  code/examples (e.g., feedparser.parse). Distractors: Plausible, explained (e.g., ''Confuses <pubDate> with ISO format'').
  Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition friendly. Output ONLY the JSON array.'
