It means the file exhibits characteristics of that family, allowing threat hunters to infer its potential capabilities, Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), and other related indicators.

        "core_logic": "Standardized formats like STIX are crucial because they provide a common language for threat intelligence. This allows different security tools and organizations to exchange and understand data, such as file hash reputations, without complex custom integrations. This interoperability is vital for collaborative threat hunting and defense, because it ensures that intelligence can be acted upon consistently.
