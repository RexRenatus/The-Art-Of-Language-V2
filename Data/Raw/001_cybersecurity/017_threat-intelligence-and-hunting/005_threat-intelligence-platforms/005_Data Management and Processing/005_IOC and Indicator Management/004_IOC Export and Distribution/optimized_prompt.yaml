active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Using the Pyramid of Pain model, debate which types of IoCs (e.g., hashes vs. TTPs) are most valuable
    for long-term defense and why context is crucial in sharing them. Discuss common misconceptions, such as treating all
    IoCs as equally valuable.
  peer_teaching: Students pair up; one explains STIX vs. TAXII (standards for export/distribution) with real-world examples,
    the other teaches the IoC lifecycle and Pyramid of Pain model. Switch roles after 5 minutes and provide peer feedback
    on clarity and accuracy.
  problem_solving: In a simulated breach scenario (e.g., malware campaign with IP addresses, file hashes, and TTPs like phishing
    emails), students create a STIX bundle for IoC export, simulate TAXII distribution to partner organizations, and discuss
    deployment challenges such as versioning, access controls, and integration with SIEM tools.
