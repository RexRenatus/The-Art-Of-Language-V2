active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how behavioral clustering addresses the limitations of signature-based
    detection in detecting advanced persistent threats (APTs). Provide examples of TTPs from MITRE ATT&CK that could be clustered,
    and predict challenges in real-world implementation. Synthesize group insights into a shared concept map.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  focus: ''
  content: Define behavioral analysis (actions/patterns vs. signatures), clustering (unsupervised grouping), classification
    (supervised labeling), threat intelligence (adversary TTPs), threat hunting (proactive detection). Contrast with signature-based
    methods.
- level: 2
  name: Layer 2
  focus: ''
  content: 'MITRE ATT&CK framework (tactics: goals like Persistence; techniques: methods like Account Manipulation). Relationships:
    Clustering discovers anomalies; classification maps to ATT&CK. Examples: Group reconnaissance scans (TA0043); classify
    as Technique T1595 Active Scanning.'

  name: Layer 3
  focus: ''
  content: 'Step-by-step: 1) Data collection (logs, network flows); 2) Feature extraction (e.g., sequence of API calls); 3)
    Clustering (K-means on behavioral vectors); 4) Classification (train model on labeled ATT&CK data); 5) Validation. Example:
    Cluster malware behaviors by TTP similarity.'

    actor attribution (e.g., link clusters to APT groups). Case: Use clusters in hunting to profile actors evading signatures.'

  Use this optimized pedagogy:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: Incorporate ties to [discussion_prompt, peer_teaching_activity, problem_solving_exercise]

  - Scaffolding: 4 layers [insert full layers here], prerequisites, concept map.

  - Research Context: Behavioral analysis vs. signatures; Clustering (unsupervised, e.g., group TTPs); Classification (supervised,
  e.g., label to ATT&CK); MITRE ATT&CK (tactics=goals, techniques=methods); Examples: IP grouping by reconnaissance, behavior
  labeling to TA0008.

  - Voter Priorities: Explicit Bloom''s progression, assessments with distractors (e.g., Which groups without labels? B. Clustering),
  concrete examples, full references (MITRE: attack.mitre.org).
