active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the most critical threat to retail/e-commerce (e.g., ransomware vs. supply
    chain attacks) and evaluate how frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK and PCI-DSS mitigate it. Support arguments with real-world
    examples and propose improvements to threat sharing via ISACs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    related but incorrect term (e.g., NIST instead of PCI-DSS), 1 extreme/overgeneralized (e.g., ''all breaches are ransomware'').
    Ensure correct answer is unambiguous and explanations debunk distractors.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate high-quality, optimized flashcards
  for the topic ''Retail and E-commerce Threat Intelligence'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting
  > Threat Intelligence Platforms > 010_Threat Analysis and Intelligence Operations > Industry and Sector-Specific Intelligence
  > Retail and E-commerce Threat Intelligence).


  Incorporate:

  - Research context: CTI is actionable info on threats/TTPs/IoCs tailored to retail (threats: data breaches, ransomware,
  phishing, supply chain, Magecart, DDoS); Frameworks: MITRE ATT&CK (retail TTPs), PCI-DSS, NIST CSF; Platforms: MISP/Anomali;
  Best practices: SIEM integration, ISACs, STIX/TAXII, SOAR/AI.

  - Sources: MITRE.org/ATTACK, PCIsecuritystandards.org, NIST SP 800-53, Retail-ISAC.org, Mandiant M-Trends Report, Recorded
  Future reports.
