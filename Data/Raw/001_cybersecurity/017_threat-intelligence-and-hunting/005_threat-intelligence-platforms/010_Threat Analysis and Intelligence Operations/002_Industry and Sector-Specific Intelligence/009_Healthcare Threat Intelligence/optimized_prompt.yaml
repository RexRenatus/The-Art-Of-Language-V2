active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the strengths and limitations of the NIST CSF's five core functions (Identify,
    Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) when applied to healthcare compared to other sectors like finance. Use real-world examples
    from ransomware attacks on hospitals to support your arguments, encouraging critical thinking on sector-specific adaptations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    ransomware as only data theft, not operational disruption); 3) Confusions (e.g., insider as external actor); 4) Sector
    irrelevancies (e.g., finance threats in healthcare). Ensure 70% MCQs, 30% open-ended.'

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema. Incorporate these pedagogical elements:


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full learning_objectives array here]


  **Active Learning:** Use concepts from discussion, peer teaching, and problem-solving to inspire applied questions.


  **Scaffolding:** Distribute flashcards: 6 Layer 1 (Foundation), 6 Layer 2 (Components), 7 Layer 3 (Implementation), 6 Layer
  4 (Integration). Explicitly reference layers in explanations.


  **Research Context:** CTI for proactive defense in healthcare (EHRs, IoMT); threats: ransomware, phishing, insider/third-party;
  frameworks: NIST CSF (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover), MITRE ATT&CK, HIPAA. Sources: NIST Cybersecurity Framework
  (nist.gov/cyberframework), MITRE ATT&CK (attack.mitre.org), HHS Cybersecurity (hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security).


  **Flashcard Schema:**

  - Front: Engaging question.

  - Back: {answer, explanation (pedagogical links), distractors (if MCQ)}.

  Follow distractor protocol strictly.


  Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''opt1'',
  ''opt2'', ''opt3'']}}, ...]. Ensure progressive complexity, measurable outcomes, and voter priorities (completeness, pedagogy).'
