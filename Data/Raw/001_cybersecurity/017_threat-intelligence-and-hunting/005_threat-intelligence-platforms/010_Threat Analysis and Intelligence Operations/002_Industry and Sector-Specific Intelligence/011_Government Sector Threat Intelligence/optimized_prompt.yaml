active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Using the MITRE ATT&CK framework, debate the most critical threats to government sectors and how Living
    Off the Land (LOTL) techniques complicate detection. Provide real-world examples from CISA reports. (Sparks critical thinking
    on misconceptions like TI being just alerts vs. contextual analysis.)
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Common errors (e.g., confuse LOTL with malware drop; mix open-source/commercial feeds)
    - Similar concepts (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK tactic IDs off-by-one; NIST CSF functions swapped)
    - Real-world distractors (e.g., outdated CISA examples or non-gov sectors)

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  using Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, and scaffolding. Topic: Government Sector Threat Intelligence (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Platforms > 010_Threat Analysis and Intelligence Operations > Industry
  and Sector-Specific Intelligence > Government Sector Threat Intelligence). Use the provided research context: TI as evidence-based
  knowledge for national security, policy, defense, IR, cooperation; Threat Feeds (open/commercial); LOTL (abusing LOLBins
  for stealth); integrate MITRE ATT&CK, NIST CSF (Identify-Protect-Detect-Respond-Recover), CISA reports. Sources: CISA.gov
  alerts, MITRE.org/attack, NIST.gov/cyberframework, wiz.io/academy/threat-intel.


  Learning Objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY]. Active Learning: Incorporate elements like discussion on MITRE/LOTL/CISA,
  peer teaching on feeds, problem-solving scenarios. Scaffolding: [INSERT scaffolding ARRAY] – ensure coverage across layers.
  Prior Knowledge: Links to general TI/cybersecurity basics.


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards following the exact schema: [INSERT flashcard_schema]. Balance types/Bloom''s/layers.
  Questions must be active (e.g., ''Map this LOTL to MITRE''), explanations tie to objectives/active learning/real examples.
  Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''source'':
  ''...'', ''concept_map_link'': ''...'', ''blooms_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''1''}}]. Ensure accuracy, no
  fabrication, distractors per protocol. Promote deep understanding for threat hunting in gov sectors.'
