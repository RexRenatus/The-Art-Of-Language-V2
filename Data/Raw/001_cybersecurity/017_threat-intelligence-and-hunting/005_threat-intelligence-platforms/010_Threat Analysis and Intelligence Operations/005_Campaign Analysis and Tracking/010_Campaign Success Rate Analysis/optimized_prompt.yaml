  discussion_prompt: 'Debate in groups: Is breakout time a more reliable indicator of campaign success than objective achievement?
    Use real-world examples from MITRE ATT&CK evaluations to support your position, considering factors like adversary sophistication
    and defender maturity. Address misconceptions that ''faster always equals more successful'' without context.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Misconception 1: Confuse breakout time with detection time (e.g., ''Breakout time is defender detection speed'').

    - Misconception 2: Overemphasize speed without objectives (e.g., ''All fast campaigns succeed regardless of goals'').

    - Misconception 3: Ignore frameworks (e.g., options without ATT&CK context).

    Ensure distractors are realistic (e.g., swapped metrics, partial truths) but lead to incorrect analysis.'

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Active Learning: [insert full active_learning object].

  - Scaffolding: Prior Knowledge + Concept Map + 4 Layers [insert full scaffolding].

  - Best Practices: Use MITRE ATT&CK for TTP mapping, calculate success % via objective achievement, compare breakout/detection
  times, integrate with hunting/incident response.

  - Sources: MITRE ATT&CK Framework, industry reports on avg breakout times (10-20 days).


  Generate flashcards per exact schema: [insert full flashcard_schema].

  Output ONLY as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''Question with A/B/C/D options'', ''back'': ''Correct: A. Explanation...''},
  ...]. Ensure coverage across Bloom''s levels, voter priorities (e.g., debate breakout vs. objectives), and no policy violations.
  High-quality, engaging, misconception-busting content.'
