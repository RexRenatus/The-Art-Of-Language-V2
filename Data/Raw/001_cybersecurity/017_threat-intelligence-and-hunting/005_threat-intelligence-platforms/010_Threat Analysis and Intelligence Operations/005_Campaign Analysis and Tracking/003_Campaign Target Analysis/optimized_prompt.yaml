  Use this exact research context:

  [Insert full Research Context here, including completed CISA: ''CISA emphasizes that understanding adversary victimology
  disrupts campaigns—profile sectors/geographies, share via AIS/JCDC, integrate with hunting. Best practices: Stepwise analysis,
  ATT&CK mapping, predictive modeling. Sources: MITRE ATT&CK (attack.mitre.org), CISA Alerts (cisa.gov), #StopRansomware Guide.'']

  - Scaffolding Layers: [Paste full layers above].

  - Active Learning: Reference in explanations where relevant (e.g., ''As in peer teaching...'').

  - Prerequisites: Link to prior 010 topics.


  Generate flashcards per schema: [Paste full schema above]. Ensure completeness (CISA full, sources), measurable verbs, progressive
  complexity. Distractors must be realistic/common errors. Output ONLY the JSON array—no extra text.'
