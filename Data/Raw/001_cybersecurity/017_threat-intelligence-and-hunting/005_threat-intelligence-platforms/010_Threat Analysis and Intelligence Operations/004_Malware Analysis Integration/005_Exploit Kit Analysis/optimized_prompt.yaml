active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the evolution of Exploit Kits from early kits like Blackhole to modern
    ones like RIG, considering why they remain effective despite widespread awareness. Support your points with real-world
    examples from threat intelligence reports.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (2) Related but incorrect term (e.g., ''phishing'' for ''drive-by download''), (3) Outdated/historical example (e.g.,
    old EK variant). Ensure distractors are educationally valuable, drawing from real EK variants/tools.'

  Generate high-quality flashcards using the provided schema. Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM JSON]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL LAYERS FROM JSON] – Tag each card with its layer.

  - Active Learning: Embed tie-ins (e.g., ''Use for peer teaching'').

  - Bloom''s Coverage: Distribute across REMEMBER to CREATE.


  Content must be comprehensive, completing EK Operation Stages: (1) Landing Page (JS checks browser/plugins), (2) Vulnerability
  Scan (detects flaws), (3) Exploit Selection (picks matching exploit), (4) Payload Delivery (drops malware), (5) Post-Exploitation
  (C2, persistence). Include analysis techniques: static (JS review), dynamic (Cuckoo/REMnux), network (Wireshark), IOCs,
  tools (Hybrid Analysis), integration (SIEM/MISP).
