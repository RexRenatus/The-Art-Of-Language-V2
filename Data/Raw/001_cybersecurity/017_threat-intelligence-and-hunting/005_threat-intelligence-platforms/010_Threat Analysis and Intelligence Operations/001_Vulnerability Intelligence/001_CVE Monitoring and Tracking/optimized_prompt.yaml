active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss how the rapid exploitation of Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) exposed gaps in traditional CVE monitoring.
    What changes to monitoring practices (e.g., API polling frequency, SIEM rules) would you recommend for similar zero-day
    vulnerabilities, and why?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on voter-noted misconceptions (e.g., 'CVE guarantees
    an exploit exists'; 'NVD assigns CVE IDs'; outdated tools like 'manual email alerts only'). Ensure distractors are realistic
    (e.g., similar CVSS scores, wrong APIs) but incorrect per official sources (cve.org, nvd.nist.gov).

  **Completed Research Context (addressing voter completeness priorities):** CVE is a MITRE-managed dictionary of publicly
  disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities, with unique CVE-YYYY-NNNN IDs. CVE Records include descriptions, references. NVD
  (NIST) enriches with CVSS v3.1/v4.0 scores, CWE mappings. CNAs (e.g., vendors) assign IDs under CVE Program rules. CVE List:
  Comprehensive, searchable glossary updated ~daily, accessible via REST API (JSON), RSS feeds. Monitoring: NVD RSS/API polling,
  scanners (Nessus, OpenVAS), SIEM integration (Splunk/ELK), exploit tracking (Exploit-DB), platforms (MISP, DefectDojo, Kenna).
  CVSS for prioritization (e.g., Critical: 9.0-10.0). Example: Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228, CVSS 10.0; discovered Dec 2021,
  PoC same day, patches Dec 9). Workflows: Detect (API scan) > Prioritize (CVSS+context) > Remediate (patch/scan) > Hunt (SIEM).
  Misconceptions: CVE ≠ exploit; NVD ≠ CVE source. Sources: [cve.org](https://cve.org), [nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov),
  [exploit-db.com](https://exploit-db.com).


  **Pedagogical Instructions:** Generate 40 flashcards (10 per Bloom level pair: Remember/Understand, Apply/Analyze, Evaluate/Create;
  distribute across 4 scaffolding layers). Align to these objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives HERE]. Incorporate active
  learning hooks (e.g., ''How would this apply to Log4Shell?''). Use university pedagogy: Scaffolding layers [INSERT scaffolding
  HERE].


  **Output Format:** JSON array of objects matching [flashcard_schema]. Ensure variety: 40% MCQ (distractors per protocol),
  30% definitions, 30% scenarios. High-quality: Active voice, concise (Q<20 words), explanations 50-100 words with real-world
  ties. No truncation; complete CVE List/tools details.'
