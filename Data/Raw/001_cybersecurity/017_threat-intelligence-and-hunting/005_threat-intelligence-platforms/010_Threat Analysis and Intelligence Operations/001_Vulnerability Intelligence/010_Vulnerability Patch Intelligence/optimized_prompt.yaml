  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the following: In the Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) incident, should organizations have prioritized
    patching based solely on CVSS score (9.8) or also on emerging exploit intelligence? Support your position with evidence
    from NVD or vendor advisories and discuss trade-offs in deployment speed vs. testing.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse CVSS Base with Temporal
    score); 2) Related but incorrect term (e.g., CVE vs. CWE); 3) Extreme value (e.g., always ''highest priority'' vs. contextual).
    Base on real CVEs/sources for realism. Ensure 20-30% flashcards are MCQ.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Vulnerability Patch Intelligence
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Platforms > 010_Threat Analysis
  and Intelligence Operations > Vulnerability Intelligence > Vulnerability Patch Intelligence).


  Use the provided LEARNING OBJECTIVES, ACTIVE LEARNING prompts, SCAFFOLDING LAYERS (4 layers exactly), and FLASHCARD SCHEMA
  to generate 100 high-quality flashcards.


  Incorporate university pedagogy: Align to Bloom''s Taxonomy (tag each), active recall, spaced repetition. Draw from research
  context: NIST SP 800-40 Rev. 4 (full guide on patch planning: inventory, test, deploy, verify), CVSS v4, NVD, Log4Shell
  (CVE-2021-44228), CISA KEV, EPSS. Link prior knowledge to basic vulns/threat intel.


  Output ONLY in JSON array of flashcards, each matching SCHEMA structure (basic, cloze, or MCQ). Strictly follow distractor
  protocol. Balance: 40% Layer 1-2 (foundational), 40% Layer 3 (steps), 20% Layer 4 (integration). Include explanations referencing
  sources/real examples. Ensure measurable, active verbs.
