active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Using the NID Model, debate whether a viral Twitter thread from an anonymous researcher (with past mixed
    accuracy) reporting a zero-day exploit deserves a B3 or C4 rating. Justify your position with real-world implications
    for threat hunting, such as resource allocation and false positive risks. Address common misconceptions like over-relying
    on source popularity.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains Source Reliability ratings (A-F) using examples/non-examples (e.g., MITRE
    ATT&CK = A, rumor forum = D), while the partner explains Information Reliability (1-6) (e.g., confirmed by multiple vendors
    = 1, contradicts known facts = 5). Switch roles and provide teach-back feedback.
  problem_solving: Present students with 4 real-world/mock sources on a phishing campaign (e.g., vendor blog, dark web leak,
    news article, social media post). In small groups, rate each using the NID Model, prioritize for threat hunting action,
    and present findings with rationale. Reflect on how this mirrors daily intel analyst tasks.

    - 'Plausible: 1 nearly correct (off-by-one rating), 1 common error, 1 absurd.'
