active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the role of correlation analysis in distinguishing between benign anomalies and true threats
    across diverse sources (e.g., network logs, threat feeds, dark web data). Discuss common pitfalls such as over-reliance
    on static IOCs versus behavioral TTPs, and propose mitigation strategies like hybrid IOC-TTP rules.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1. Common misconceptions (e.g., IOCs as behaviors,
    missing lifecycle phases); 2. Partial truths (e.g., 4 phases instead of 6); 3. Superficial similarities (e.g., similar
    tools/sources); 4. Voter-noted errors (e.g., incomplete lifecycle). Ensure distractors promote critical thinking.'

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: Use to inspire higher-order questions (e.g., evaluation prompts from discussion).

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste the scaffolding_layers array here]. Ensure coverage across layers.

  - Research Context: CTI definition (cyware.com); Correlation links data for unified threats; Full 6-phase CTI lifecycle;
  IOCs/TTPs; Sources: chaossearch.io (threat hunting), tandfonline.com (techniques), MITRE ATT&CK.

  - Voter Priorities: Full CTI lifecycle (add phases 5-6); Examples (IP IOC + logs + ATT&CK); Pitfalls (IOC over-reliance).


  Generate 25-35 flashcards following the exact flashcard_schema. Distribute across Bloom''s levels and layers. Promote active
  recall, spaced repetition. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects, no extra text.'
