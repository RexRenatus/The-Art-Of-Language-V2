    SIEM integration and aggregation; switch roles and quiz each other on interconnections.'
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A suspected breach in a hybrid cloud environment. Design a log collection plan identifying key
    events from SIEM (e.g., correlated alerts), firewalls (e.g., blocked connections), and IDS/IPS (e.g., intrusion attempts).
    Outline tools, transmission methods, and analysis steps.'

  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [paste full list above].

  - Active learning: Weave in prompts for discussion/peer-teaching/problem-solving.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute across 4 layers [paste full scaffolding above]; tag each card.

  - Research context: Core concepts (logs, SIEM=aggregation/analysis, Firewall=traffic control/logs, IDS=detect, IPS=prevent/block);
  NIST SP 800-92 (full log mgmt lifecycle); standards (ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, MITRE); best practices (Syslog, agents, time-sync);
  concept map [from layer 1].

  - Voter consensus: 82.9% approval; emphasize pedagogy, completeness.


  Use flashcard schema: [paste full schema above]. Output as JSON array of 30 flashcards. Ensure variety: 60% MCQ, 40% short
  answer/cloze. Progressive difficulty matching scaffolding. No duplicates; cover all objectives/layers.'
