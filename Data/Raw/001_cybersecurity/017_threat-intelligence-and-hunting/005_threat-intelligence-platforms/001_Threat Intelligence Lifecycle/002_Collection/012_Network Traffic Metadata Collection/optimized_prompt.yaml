  **Completed Research Context:** Network Traffic Metadata: Derived data (flows, apps, behaviors, payload patterns) beyond
  headers. DPI: L7 payload analysis (Splunk Lantern). Flows: Packet sequences (MITRE CAR). IoCs: IPs/FQDNs/SNI/TTPs. RFC 9232
  (full): NETCONF Datastore Subscription Capability for network telemetry devices; modules (interfaces, BGP, OSPF, IS-IS,
  PIM, multicast; YANG push); export mechanisms (IPFIX, sFlow, streaming UDP/TCP); strengths: real-time, subscription-based;
  limits: NETCONF dependency, overhead. Tools: Wireshark, Zeek, Suricata, nfdump. Sources: https://lantern.splunk.com/Data_Types/Deep_packet_inspection_data;
  https://car.mitre.org/data_model/flow; https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9232; https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7011
  (IPFIX); https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9424 (if relevant, mobility); MITRE ATT&CK.
