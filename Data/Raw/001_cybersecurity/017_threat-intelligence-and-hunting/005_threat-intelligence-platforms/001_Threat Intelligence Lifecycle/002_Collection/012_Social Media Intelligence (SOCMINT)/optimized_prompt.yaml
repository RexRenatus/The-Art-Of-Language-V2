  Research Context: SOCMINT is a subset of OSINT focusing on public social media data (profiles, posts, metadata) for actionable
  threat insights. Key terms: SOCMINT, OSINT, Actionable Insights, Threat Intelligence, Cyber Threat Index (AI/NLP). Tools:
  Twint, Hootsuite. Ethics: GDPR/CCPA compliance critical (privacy vs. detection, e.g., election interference). Sources: blog.mcafeeinstitute.com/socmint/,
  osint.industries/post/social-media-intelligence-socmint, mdpi.com/2079-9292/12/5/1242. Scaffolding: Use 4 layers provided.
  Concept Map: SOCMINT → OSINT, Collection Phase, GDPR/CCPA, Threat Intelligence.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Active Learning: Tie cards to discussion (ethics), peer teaching (SOCMINT vs OSINT), problem-solving (Twitter hunt).

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert full layers above]. Balance cards: 25% L1, 25% L2, 25% L3, 25% L4.


  Generate 60 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema:

  - 40% MCQ with 3 distractors (plausible misconceptions).

  - 30% Basic Q&A.

  - 30% Application/Analysis scenarios.

  Tag each with Bloom''s level, layer, source.

  Output ONLY a JSON array: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'':
  1-4, ''explanation'': ''...'', ''source'': ''...''}]. Ensure university-level rigor, active recall, spaced repetition optimization.'
