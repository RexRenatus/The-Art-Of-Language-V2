  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL LIST ABOVE] (hint at these in explanations).

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL LIST ABOVE] (tag each card).


  Content Sources: upguard.com (definitions Metrics/KPIs/KRIs/MTTD/MTTR), sentinelone.com/purplesec.us (threat intel KPIs).
  Expanded KPIs: MTTD, MTTR, Number of Security Incidents (detected/handled per period), IOCs Processed, Intelligence Accuracy
  Rate (%), Threat Coverage Ratio (%), False Positive Rate (%).


  Follow EXACT Flashcard Schema: [INSERT FULL SCHEMA ABOVE]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"front": "...",
  "back": "...", "type": "cloze/mcq/etc", "bloom_level": "...", "layer": 1-4, "difficulty": "easy/medium/hard"}.


  Ensure cards scaffold progressively (more Layer1 first), use distractor protocol strictly, explanations pedagogical with
  ties to objectives/activities/lifecycle. High-quality, error-free, optimized for spaced repetition (Anki-compatible).'
