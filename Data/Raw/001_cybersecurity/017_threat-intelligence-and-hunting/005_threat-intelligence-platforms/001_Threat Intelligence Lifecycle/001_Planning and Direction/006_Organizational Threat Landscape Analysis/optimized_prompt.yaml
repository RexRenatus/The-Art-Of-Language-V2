active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the top three threats in your chosen organization's threat landscape (e.g., ransomware for healthcare).
    Compare prioritization using NIST CSF versus MITRE ATT&CK. Which framework better suits the Planning and Direction phase
    of the TI lifecycle, and why? Support with evidence from recent breaches.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    TTPs with IOCs), framework swaps (NIST vs MITRE), or outdated examples. Ensure 1-2 distractors are ''attractive errors''
    from real-world confusions (e.g., ''Threat hunting is passive monitoring''). Vary difficulty.'
