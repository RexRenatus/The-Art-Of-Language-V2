  discussion_prompt: 'Debate: In threat intelligence hunting, should PII ever be retained in shared IOCs for better threat
    tracking, or is full anonymization always preferable? Use the data minimization principle and provide pros/cons citing
    NIST SP 800-122 and real-world examples.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate high-quality, pedagogically optimized flashcards using university-style methods (Bloom''s Taxonomy progression,
  active learning hooks, scaffolding). Cover these learning objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]. Incorporate
  active learning for deeper engagement: [INSERT active_learning DISCUSSION_PROMPT, PEER_TEACHING_ACTIVITY, PROBLEM_SOLVING_EXERCISE

  Sources for grounding: NIST SP 800-122 (PII protection guide), NIST Privacy Framework (full: Identify-Govern-Control-Communicate),
  NIST SP 800-63 (data min), GDPR (Art 4/25 pseudonymization), CCPA. Web context: PII as direct/indirect identifiers; data
  min reduces risks; privacy mgmt in threat intel/hunting.
