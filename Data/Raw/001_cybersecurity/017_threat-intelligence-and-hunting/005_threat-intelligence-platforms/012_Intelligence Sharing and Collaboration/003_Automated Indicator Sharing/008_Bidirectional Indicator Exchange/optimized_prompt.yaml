active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of bidirectional indicator exchange: How does sharing TTPs
    via STIX enhance collective defense against advanced persistent threats (APTs), but what trust and privacy mechanisms
    (e.g., anonymization) are essential to mitigate risks like poisoning attacks? Reference the Pyramid of Pain and provide
    evidence from sources like OASIS STIX specs.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education on ''Bidirectional Indicator Exchange''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Platforms > 012_Intelligence Sharing
  and Collaboration > Automated Indicator Sharing > Bidirectional Indicator Exchange). Generate 40-50 high-quality multiple-choice
  flashcards using the exact schema: Front (Question with Bloom''s level and layer), Back (correct_answer, 3 distractors,
  explanation with links to objectives/layers/active learning, bloom_reference, scaffold_layer, concept_map_link).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full list above].

  - Active Learning: Tie explanations to discussion/peer-teach/problem-solving.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute evenly across 4 layers [paste full scaffolding]. Balance Bloom''s (Remember/Understand: 30%, Apply/Analyze:
  40%, Evaluate/Create: 30%).

  - Prerequisites: Assume knowledge of IoCs/networking/threat detection.

  - Key Content: STIX 2.1 Domain Objects (Indicator, Attack-Pattern, etc.), TAXII channels, MISP/US-CERT AIS, Pyramid of Pain,
  Kill Chain, trust models, sources (OASIS STIX/TAXII, MISP site).

  - Distractor Protocol: [paste full protocol].
