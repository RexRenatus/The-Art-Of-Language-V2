active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between rapid AIS sharing for collective defense (e.g., using TAXII for real-time
    IOC exchange) and risks of exposing sensitive IOCs to untrusted partners. Reference CISA AIS brokering examples and real-world
    incidents to support arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., TAXII as language vs. protocol), (2) Confuse similar terms (STIX vs. TAXII, CTI vs. DM), (3) Partial truths (e.g.,
    brokering only federal-to-nonfederal), (4) Outdated/irrelevant (e.g., non-STIX formats). Ensure distractors from research/voter
    context.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Threat Intelligence Platforms.
  Topic: CISA Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) Program (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat
  Intelligence Platforms > 012_Intelligence Sharing and Collaboration > Automated Indicator Sharing > CISA AIS Program). Use
  provided research: AIS enables automated CTI/DM exchange via STIX/TAXII; brokering by CISA; scoring framework. Examples:
  CTI=IP 192.0.2.1/hash abc123, DM=YARA rules. Voter consensus: 100% approval, integrate pedagogy (Bloom''s, scaffolding),
  engagement (debate/problem-solving), completeness (ISA ACS: isa-iec-62443, sources: cisa.gov/ais, oasis-open.org/stix-taxii).


  Learning Objectives: [insert array above]. Active Learning: Incorporate elements into explanations (e.g., reference debate
  in eval cards). Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [insert array above]; 25% per layer.


  Generate flashcards per schema [insert schema above]. Cover all Bloom''s levels proportionally (remember/understand: 30%,
  apply/analyze: 40%, evaluate/create: 30%). Mix types: 40% MCQ (w/ distractors), 30% QA, 30% cloze. Ensure active recall,
  no hints on front. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards. Prioritize university pedagogy: measurable, scaffolded, engaging.'
