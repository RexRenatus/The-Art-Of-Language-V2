These measures directly address the vulnerabilities associated with the insecure FTP protocol, preventing unauthorized access and data exposure.",

        "analogy": "Port 21 (FTP) is like an unlocked back door. The best security is to either lock that door permanently (disable FTP), replace it with a secure, locked door (SFTP/FTPS), or block access to it entirely (firewall rule)."
