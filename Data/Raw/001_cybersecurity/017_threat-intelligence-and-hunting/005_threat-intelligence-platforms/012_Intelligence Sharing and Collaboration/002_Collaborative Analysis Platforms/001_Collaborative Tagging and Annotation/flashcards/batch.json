        "core_logic": "The best practice for tagging in MISP is to apply tags at the event level when they are relevant to all or most attributes, because this promotes efficiency and reduces clutter. Attribute-level tags should be reserved for exceptions or specific nuances, because this layered approach maintains clarity and searchability.",
