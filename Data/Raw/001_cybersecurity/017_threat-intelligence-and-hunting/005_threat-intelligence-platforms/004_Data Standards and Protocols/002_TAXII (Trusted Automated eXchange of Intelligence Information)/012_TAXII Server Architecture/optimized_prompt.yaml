    - explain
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of using Collections versus Channels in TAXII for different threat intelligence
    scenarios, such as real-time alerts vs. batch historical data sharing. Consider scalability, security, and client needs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
  additional_activities:
  - Think-pair-share on misconceptions (e.g., TAXII is a transport protocol over HTTP/1.1/HTTPS, not a data format).
  - Role-playing client-server interactions.
  - Hands-on setup with open-source TAXII servers like OpenCTI or MISP.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education on TAXII Server Architecture. Use the provided
  research context, learning objectives (spanning Bloom''s: remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, create), active
  learning activities (discussion on Collections vs Channels, peer teaching on API Roots/Endpoints, problem-solving for agency
  design), and 4 scaffolding layers to create high-quality, pedagogically optimized flashcards.


  Key facts from research: TAXII is RESTful API over HTTP/1.1/HTTPS for CTI exchange; API Root (grouping URL), Collection
  (pull repo), Channel (push, future); Discovery via DNS/endpoint; open-source: OpenCTI, MISP. Misconceptions: TAXII=transport
  (not STIX=data).


  Topic hierarchy: [''Cybersecurity'', ''Threat Intelligence And Hunting'', ''Threat Intelligence Platforms'', ''004_Data
  Standards and Protocols'', ''TAXII (Trusted Automated eXchange of Intelligence Information)'', ''TAXII Server Architecture'']


  Generate 20-30 flashcards covering all objectives, layers, and activities. Each must inspire active recall, include exactly
  3 plausible distractors (e.g., swap Collection/Channel, confuse with STIX).


  Output ONLY a valid JSON array of objects conforming EXACTLY to this REQUIRED FLASHCARD SCHEMA: {question: string, answer:
  string, distractors: [string,string,string], bloom_level: ''remember|understand|apply|analyze|evaluate|create'', explanation:
  string, topic_hierarchy: [...]}. No extra text, wrappers, or deviations.'
