active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages of CEF over plain Syslog for threat hunting in a multi-vendor
    environment. Consider scalability, parsing efficiency, and real-world SIEM integration challenges, referencing ArcSight
    examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Plausible but incomplete (e.g., Syslog field instead of CEF)
    - Common misconceptions (e.g., Severity as 1-5 vs 0-10)
    - Edge cases (e.g., optional vs required fields)
    - Related concepts (e.g., OCSF keys vs CEF extensions)
    - Ensure 1-2 distractors from voter-completed fields (e.g., Device Version)

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste full list above].

  - Active Learning: Use for inspiration (e.g., flashcards simulating parsing exercises).

  - Scaffolding: Generate 5 flashcards per layer [Paste full scaffolding above]; ensure progression.

  - Voter Consensus: Ensure completeness (full header: Version|Device Vendor|Device Product|Device Version|Device Event Class
  ID|Device Event Class Name|Severity|Extension; examples like ''CEF:0|ArcSight|Logger|1.0|100|login failed|5|src=10.1.1.1
  suser=admin msg=Invalid password''); prerequisites (Syslog/SIEM); big picture (ArcSight SIEM, threat hunting normalization).

  - Research: CEF by ArcSight/OpenText; extensible Syslog enhancement for SIEM/log management.


  Generate 25 flashcards following this schema [Paste full schema above]. Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'':
