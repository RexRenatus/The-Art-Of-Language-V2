active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss the operational risks of incorrect STIX timestamps or versioning (e.g., mismatched 'created'
    vs. 'modified', or revoking without updating 'modified') when sharing threat intelligence across organizations. How might
    this lead to SOC failures like duplicate alerts or missed updates?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Complete Research Context (synthesized and expanded from sources like OASIS STIX 2.1 docs, STIX Project):** STIX is a
  JSON-based language for cyber threat intelligence (CTI). Objects (SDOs like Indicators, SCOs like IPs) have versioning:
  stable ''id'' (e.g., ''indicator--8e2e2d2b-17d4-4cbf-938f-98ee46b3cd3f''), ''created'' (first RFC 3339 UTC timestamp, immutable),
  ''modified'' (updated RFC 3339 UTC on changes), ''revoked'' (boolean; true + new ''modified'' deprecates). Versioning workflow:
  Publish v1 (created=modified=''2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z''), update v2 (same id, modified=''2023-01-02T12:00:00.000Z'', changed
  pattern), revoke (revoked=true, modified advanced). Bundles hold multiple versions. Integrates with TAXII; timestamps ensure
  chronology in hunting. STIX 2.1 enhances vs. 2.0 with better revocation.


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Generate 25 flashcards aligned to these learning objectives [insert learning_objectives array].
  Incorporate active learning hooks (e.g., reference discussion on SOC risks). Scaffold across 4 layers [insert scaffolding
  array].


  **Output flashcards using this exact schema [insert flashcard_schema]:** JSON array of objects, e.g., [{''front'': ''...'',
  ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''hints'': [...], ''tags'': [...]}}]. Balance Bloom''s levels
  (4 Remember/Understand, 8 Apply/Analyze, 8 Evaluate/Create, 5 mixed). Use distractor protocol for MCQs. Ensure measurable,
  active recall. Reference RFC 3339 (e.g., ''2023-10-05T14:48:00.000Z''). Make explanations tie to real-world CTI (e.g., ''Incorrect
  modified leads to stale intel in MISP/ThreatConnect'').'
