  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the role of SCOs in threat hunting workflows: How do misconceptions like
    treating SCOs as interchangeable with SDOs impact intelligence accuracy? Use examples from real-world breaches (e.g.,
    SolarWinds) to argue for or against SCOs as ''evidentiary atoms'' versus higher-level SDO narratives.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert STIX 2.1 flashcard generator for ''STIX Cyber-Observable Objects (SCOs)'' in Cybersecurity
  > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Platforms > 004_Data Standards and Protocols > STIX > SCOs. Use
  the provided learning objectives, active learning ideas, 4-layer scaffolding (with prior knowledge and concept map), and
  flashcard schema to generate 75 high-quality flashcards.


  Incorporate: Voter priorities (pedagogy via Bloom''s/scaffolding, completeness with sources/JSON examples, engagement via
  logs/concept map, snake_case/valid JSON). Web context: SCOs as atomic evidence (files, IPs, processes) vs SDOs; STIX 2.1
  Parts 3/4 (OASIS links).


  Generate variety: MCQs (distractors per protocol), short answer, JSON construction. Tie to layers (e.g., Layer 1: recall
  types). Include real log snippets (e.g., Apache/Zeek logs) for mapping. Explanations reference specs, address misconceptions
  (SCOs ≠ SDOs).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''hints'': [...], ''example'': ''...''}}, ...]. Ensure valid, educational, no extra fields.'
