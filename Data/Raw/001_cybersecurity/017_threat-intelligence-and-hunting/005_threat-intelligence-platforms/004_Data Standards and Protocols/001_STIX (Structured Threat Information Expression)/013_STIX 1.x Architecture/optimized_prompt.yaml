  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the role of STIX 1.x versus CybOX in threat intelligence sharing: How
    does STIX enable structured CTI while CybOX focuses on observables? Provide examples from real-world threat reports and
    predict challenges in integration.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
