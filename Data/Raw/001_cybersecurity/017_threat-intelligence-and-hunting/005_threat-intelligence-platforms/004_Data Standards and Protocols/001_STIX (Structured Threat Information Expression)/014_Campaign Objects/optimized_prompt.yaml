active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how Campaign objects in STIX provide broader context for threat intelligence
    compared to isolated Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). Use examples from recent cyberattacks (e.g., SolarWinds) to argue
    for or against their prioritization in threat hunting workflows.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
