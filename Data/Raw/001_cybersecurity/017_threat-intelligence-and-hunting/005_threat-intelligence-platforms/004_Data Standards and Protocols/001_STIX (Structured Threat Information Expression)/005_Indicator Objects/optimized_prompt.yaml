active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, take turns explaining the STIX Indicator Object structure (e.g., pattern, indicator_types, valid_from/valid_until)
    and crafting a sample pattern (e.g., YARA for a malware hash or SNORT for network traffic); partner quizzes the other
    on components and relationships to SDOs.
  problem_solving: Given a real-world scenario (e.g., SolarWinds supply chain attack), students create and validate STIX Indicators
    for key IoCs (e.g., hashes, domains, behaviors), then test in a mock EDR/IDS tool or simulate integration with SIEM; role-play
    as SOC analysts triaging alerts and building a peer-reviewed threat feed.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in STIX and Threat Intelligence.
  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on ''Indicator Objects'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting
  > Threat Intelligence Platforms > 004_Data Standards and Protocols > STIX > Indicator Objects). Use provided research: IoCs
  as artifacts (IPs, hashes, etc.); STIX Indicator SDO with patterns (STIX Patterning/YARA/SNORT); Pyramid of Pain (Hashes,
  IPs/Domains, Network/Host Artifacts like registry/mutexes/TLS certs, Tools, TTPs); tools (EDR/IDS/SIEM/MISP); sources (oasis-open.github.io/stix/v2.1,
