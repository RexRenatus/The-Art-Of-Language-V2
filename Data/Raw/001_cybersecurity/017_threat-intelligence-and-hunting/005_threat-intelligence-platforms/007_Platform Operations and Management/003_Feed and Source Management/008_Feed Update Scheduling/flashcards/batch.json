This predictable rhythm allows for consistent ingestion of new indicators of compromise (IOCs) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), which is fundamental for maintaining an effective and up-to-date security posture. Because timely data is essential for proactive defense, regular updates enable security operations centers (SOCs) to detect and respond to threats before they can cause significant damage.",
