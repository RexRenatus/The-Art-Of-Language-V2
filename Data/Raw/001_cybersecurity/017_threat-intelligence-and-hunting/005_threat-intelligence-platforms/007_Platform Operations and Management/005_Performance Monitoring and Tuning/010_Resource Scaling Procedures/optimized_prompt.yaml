active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a scenario where a ransomware attack surges IoC volume by 10x, debate the trade-offs between horizontal
    scaling (adding servers) vs. vertical scaling (upgrading hardware) in threat intelligence platforms, considering factors
    like cost, downtime, and MITRE ATT&CK TTP detection speed.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate this research context: Resource scaling dynamically adjusts personnel, tools, computing for threat detection/response.
  Key concepts: Threat Intelligence (threat info for decisions), Threat Hunting (proactive malicious activity search), Resource
  Scaling (adjust resources for demands), IoCs (intrusion indicators), TTPs (MITRE ATT&CK adversary behaviors). Frameworks:
  MITRE ATT&CK (tactics/techniques); NIST CSF (Identify threats, Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover with scaling); best practices
  include KPIs (CPU>80%, memory spikes, query volume 10x), horizontal (add servers) vs vertical (upgrade hardware) scaling,
  auto-triggers, personnel surges during incidents like ransomware (per CISA). Sources: chaossearch.io/blog/threat-hunting-methods-frameworks,
