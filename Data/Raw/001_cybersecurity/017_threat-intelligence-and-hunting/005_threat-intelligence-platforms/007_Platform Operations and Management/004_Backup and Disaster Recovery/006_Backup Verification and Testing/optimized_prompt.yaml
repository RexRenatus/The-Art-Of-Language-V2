active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between conducting frequent full recovery tests (high assurance
    but disruptive) versus periodic verification checks (less disruptive but potentially insufficient). Reference CIS Control
    11.3 and NIST SP 800-53 CP-4 to support arguments, and propose a balanced approach for a threat intelligence platform.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol:
  - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse RTO with RPO), 2) Partial truth/overgeneralization
    (e.g., ''backups don''t need testing if encrypted''), 3) Extreme/unrealistic (e.g., ''test daily full restores'').'
  - Base on research context, voter priorities, standards to ensure accuracy.
  - Avoid random; make challenging for mid-level learners.

  - Research Context: Core concepts (Backup, Verification, Testing, RTO, RPO); Standards (NIST CSF PR.DS-11, NIST SP 800-53
  Rev.5 CP-4/CP-9/CP-10; CIS v8 Safeguard 11.1-11.7 fully: 11.1 Practices, 11.2 Automated Backups, 11.3 Verify Integrity/Efficacy,
  11.4 Offsite, 11.5 Protect Data, 11.6 Full Test, 11.7 Secure Storage); Sources (NIST CSF 2.0: https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework,
  NIST SP 800-53 Rev5: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final, CIS Controls v8: https://www.cisecurity.org/controls).

  - Active Learning: Draw from for scenario-based cards.


  Use EXACT Flashcard Schema: Front (MCQ with A/B/C/D, C=correct), Back (Correct Answer + Explanation + Distractors Explained).
  Follow Distractor Protocol strictly. Ensure Bloom''s progression, scaffolding coverage, accuracy (no NIST SP 800-2020 errors).
  Vary difficulty; include higher-order (analyze/evaluate/create) via scenarios.
