  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse RPO with RTO/downtime).
    2) Inverse/extreme value (e.g., if correct is ''1 hour'', distractor ''1 day''). 3) Related but incorrect term (e.g.,
    ''backup size'' instead of ''time window''). Ensure distractors are realistic based on research context (tiers, calculations)
    and test higher Bloom''s levels.'

  Incorporate scaffolding layers progressively (Layer 1 foundation to Layer 4 integration):

  [INSERT scaffolding_layers ARRAY HERE]


  Embed active learning hooks (e.g., ''Relates to discussion on financial vs. marketing RPO'').


  Use research context: RPO = max acceptable data loss time; influences backup frequency; tiers (Tier 1 zero, Tier 2 minutes,
  etc.); RPO calculation via BIA (backup freq ≤ RPO); example: RPO=1hr → hourly backups.


  Follow exact schema:

  [INSERT flashcard_schema HERE]


  Output as JSON array of objects: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''blooms_level'': ''...'',
  ''layer'': 1-4}]. Ensure distractors are plausible. No duplicates; vary difficulty.'
