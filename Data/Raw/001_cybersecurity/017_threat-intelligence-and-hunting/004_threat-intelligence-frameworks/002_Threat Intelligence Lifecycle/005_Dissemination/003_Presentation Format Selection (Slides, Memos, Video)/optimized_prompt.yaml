active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether slides or video is better for disseminating urgent threat intelligence
    to C-level executives during a live incident. Use audience analysis, strengths/weaknesses, and real-world examples from
    CISA or MITRE to support your position.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    weakness as strength), 1 misconception (e.g., ''videos always best for executives''). Ensure plausibility from real-world

  Core Content (complete and balanced):

  - **Slides**: Strengths (visual appeal, structured narrative, engagement, summarization); Weaknesses (superficial detail,
  tech-dependent); Best Practices (clarity: <5 lines/slide, visuals/charts for ATT&CK TTPs/IOCs, 10-20-30 rule); Use Cases
  (A: Exec briefings on high-level threats; B: IOC summaries; C: Q&A sessions); Sources: MITRE ATT&CK, CISA Alerts.

  - **Memos**: Strengths (detailed, archival, precise for technical depth); Weaknesses (less engaging, read-time); Best Practices
  (structure: Exec summary, findings/analysis, recs/actions; concise language, STIX embeds); Use Cases (analyst handoffs,
  policy updates, detailed TTP reports); Sources: NIST SP 800-61, SANS Institute.

  - **Video**: Strengths (demonstrative, training/replayable, remote-friendly); Weaknesses (production time, bandwidth); Best
  Practices (scripted, short 5-10min segments, visuals/demos, captions); Use Cases (hunt walkthroughs, training on ATT&CK
  mappings, remote briefings); Sources: CISA Video Guidance, MITRE Engenuity.

  - **Decision Matrix**: Factors - Audience (Exec:Slides, Tech:Memo, Train:Video), Urgency (High:Slides/Video), Detail (High:Memo),
  Interactivity (High:Slides/Video).

  - Links: Builds on TI Lifecycle (Analysis → Dissemination); Integrates ATT&CK/STIX.

  Generate 25 flashcards using the exact schema: Front (question + tags), Back (answer, explanation, distractors w/why wrong,
  active tie-in, refs). Cover all layers/Bloom''s evenly. Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition friendly,
  no hints on front. Output as numbered list in markdown for easy import (e.g., Anki).'
