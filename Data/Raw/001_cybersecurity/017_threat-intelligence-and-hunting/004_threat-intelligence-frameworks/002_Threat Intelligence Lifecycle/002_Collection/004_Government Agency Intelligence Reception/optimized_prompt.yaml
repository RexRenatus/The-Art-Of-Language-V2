  Topic: ''Government Agency Intelligence Reception'' (Category: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat
  Intelligence Frameworks > 003_Threat Intelligence Lifecycle > 003_Collection > Government Agency Intelligence Reception).
  Definition: The collection phase in the threat intelligence lifecycle for government entities, involving reception of CTI
  (IoCs, TTPs) via standards like NIST SP 800-150, STIX/TAXII, from sources like CISA/US-CERT feeds, integrated with TIPs,
  MITRE ATT&CK, and threat hunting.


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives: [insert learning_objectives array here]

  - Active learning: Inspire cards that prep for [insert active_learning_components here]

  - Scaffolding: Build cards progressively across 4 layers: [insert scaffolding_layers here]

  - Concept map: ''Intelligence Reception'' (central) ←→ STIX/TAXII, TIPs, NIST 800-150 → Collection → Processing → Hunting.

  - Research context: CTI (NIST.gov), IoCs/TTPs (MITRE ATT&CK), NIST SP 800-150 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/150/final),
  STIX/TAXII (oasis-open.org), CISA/US-CERT (cisa.gov), NIST CSF (Identify/Protect/Detect via intel).


  Generate flashcards per schema: [insert flashcard_generation_schema here]. Output as JSON array of objects: [{''type'':
  ''MCQ'' or ''Q&A'', ''layer'': 1-4, ''bloom_level'': ''REMEMBER'' etc., ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...''}]. Ensure
  measurable, gov-focused, complete (no truncations), with distractors and explanations. Vary difficulty progressively.'
