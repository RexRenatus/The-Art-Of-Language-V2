  Incorporate this optimized content:

  [Insert full scaffolding_layers content here, including frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK, Cyber Kill Chain: Reconnaissance→Actions
  on Objectives; Diamond Model: 4 nodes), misconceptions, concept map, prior knowledge, sources: MITRE ATT&CK (mitre.org),
  Lockheed Martin (lockheedmartin.com), Diamond Model (parnell.io), SANS Institute, NIST SP 800-150].


  Learning Objectives: [Insert learning_objectives array]. Active Learning: Use for scenario-based cards [Insert active_learning_components
  summaries].


  Generate 60 flashcards per the exact schema:

  - 20 MCQs (5/layer): Question | Options A-D | Back: Correct (e.g., ''A: Explanation... Distractors wrong because...'') +
  Bloom + Layer + Source.

  - 12 Cloze (3/layer): Front with {} blanks | Back: Answers + Expl.

  - 8 Short Answer (2/layer): Scenario | Model Ans + Rubric + Expl.


  Distractors: Strictly per protocol (misconceptions, partial truths). Ensure progressive difficulty (Layer 1 easy REMEMBER
  → Layer 4 CREATE). Output as JSON array of objects: {''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}, ''bloom'':
  ''...'', ''layer'': 1, ''source'': ''...''}.


  Balance: 30% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 40% APPLY/ANALYZE, 30% EVALUATE/CREATE. High-quality, exam-ready, active recall optimized.'
