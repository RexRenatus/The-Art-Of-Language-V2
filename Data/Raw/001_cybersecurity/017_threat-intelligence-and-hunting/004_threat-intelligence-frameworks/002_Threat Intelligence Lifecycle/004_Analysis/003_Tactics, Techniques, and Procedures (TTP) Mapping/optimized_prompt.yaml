  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives** (span Bloom''s): 1. REMEMBER: Define TTPs/Sub-techniques. 2. UNDERSTAND: Explain TTP mapping in
  Threat Intel Lifecycle Analysis & ATT&CK matrices (Enterprise, Mobile, ICS). 3. APPLY: Map behaviors to ATT&CK. 4. ANALYZE:
  Compare actors (APT28, Conti). 5. EVALUATE: Critique TTP maps. 6. CREATE: Design custom maps.

  - **Scaffolding Layers**: Layer 1 (definitions, lifecycle link), Layer 2 (ATT&CK matrices/components, examples), Layer 3
  (mapping steps), Layer 4 (Sigma/Diamond integrations).

  - **Content Sources**: MITRE ATT&CK (attack.mitre.org) - Tactics (why, e.g., TA0001), Techniques (how, e.g., T1078), Sub-techniques
  (.001), Procedures (actor-specific). Palo Alto (paloaltonetworks.in/cyberpedia/what-is-mitre-attack-matrix), AVFirewalls
  (avfirewalls.com/MITRE-ATTCK.asp). Complete matrices: Enterprise (Recon-Impact), Mobile (T1430), ICS (T0806).

  - **Active Learning Tie-ins**: Use real-world (APT28 T1059, Conti T1486), steps (collect→identify→map→share).


  **Output Format**: JSON array of objects, each: {"front": "Question", "back": "Answer", "options": ["A. Distractor1", "B.
  Correct", "C. Distractor2", "D. Distractor3"], "explanation": "Rationale + why distractors wrong", "metadata": {"blooms_level":
  "REMEMBER", "layer": "1", "hierarchy": "[exact hierarchy]", "sources": "[list]"}}. Balance: 12-13 per objective/layer. Exactly
  3 distractors per card (plausible: confusion, error, mismatch; explain why wrong). Questions: 40% recall, 30% apply/analyze,
  30% evaluate/create. Ensure completeness (all matrices, actors).'
