active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between manual IoC extraction (e.g., contextual reading
    for TTPs) and automated methods (e.g., regex for IPs/hashes). How does the Pyramid of Pain influence your choice for different
    threat hunting scenarios? Support with examples from real-world reports.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in 'Indicator Extraction from\
  \ Reports' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Frameworks > 003_Threat\
  \ Intelligence Lifecycle > Processing > Indicator Extraction from Reports). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized\
  \ for Anki/Quizlet, covering all Bloom's levels via these objectives: [insert learning_objectives array here]. Incorporate\
  \ scaffolding layers progressively: Foundation (defs, Pyramid), Components (types, steps), Implementation (checklist, example\
  \ excerpt), Integration (challenges, best practices). Include active learning elements like discussion hooks in explanations.\n\
  \nUse this exact schema per flashcard in JSON array output:\n[\n  {\n    'front': 'Question text...',\n    'back': {\n \
  \     'answer': 'Correct answer...',\n      'explanation': 'Detailed explanation with rationale, Pyramid reference, layer\

  \ read → pattern recog → validate), tools (regex/YARA/MISP), challenges (false positives/obfuscation), prior knowledge (builds\
  \ on Gathering reports), sample excerpt ('SHA256: abc123... IP:192.0.2.1 T1071'), concept map (Extraction → Reports → IoCs\
  \ → Hunting).\n\nDistractors: Plausible errors (e.g., mis-type IoC). Balance: 20% remember/understand, 30% apply/analyze,\
  \ 30% evaluate, 20% create. Vary formats: 40% MCQ, 30% short answer, 20% scenario extraction, 10% create-your-own. Ensure\
