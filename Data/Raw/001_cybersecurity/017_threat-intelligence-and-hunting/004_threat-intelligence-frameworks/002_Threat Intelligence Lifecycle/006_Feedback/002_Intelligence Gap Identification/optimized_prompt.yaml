  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE]

  - Research Context: Intelligence Gap = deficiency hindering defense (Recorded Future). TI Lifecycle feedback identifies
  gaps post-analysis. Frameworks: MITRE ATT&CK (TTP mapping), NIST CSF (Identify gaps in assets/threats), CTID INFORM (maturity).
  Prerequisites: Planning/Collection/Analysis stages.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema:

  Ensure pedagogical alignment: Progress from lower to higher Bloom''s, scaffolded layers, distractors per protocol. Make
  explanations educational (1-3 sentences, with source ties). Output as JSON array of flashcards, each with ''type'', ''bloom_level'',
  ''scaffolding_layer'', ''objective_aligned'', and fields per type.'
