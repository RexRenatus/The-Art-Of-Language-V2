  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL DESCRIPTION FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving to inspire scenario-based cards.

  - Generate flashcards following EXACT schema: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD SCHEMA FROM ABOVE].

  - Ensure 100% coverage: Balance Bloom''s (Remember 15%, Understand 20%, Apply 20%, Analyze 20%, Evaluate 15%, Create 10%);
  Layers (25% each); Voter priorities (metrics, NIST completion, concept maps).

  - Content grounded in: CTI defs, Threat Hunting, Frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK for TTPs, CTI-CMM maturity, INFORM assessment,
  NIST CSF full: Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover for CTI integration), Lifecycle Feedback metrics (detection rates,
  response times), real-world examples/case studies.

  - Output ONLY as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'':
  ''...'', ''layer'': ''...'', ''references'': ''...''}}, ...]. No extra text.'
