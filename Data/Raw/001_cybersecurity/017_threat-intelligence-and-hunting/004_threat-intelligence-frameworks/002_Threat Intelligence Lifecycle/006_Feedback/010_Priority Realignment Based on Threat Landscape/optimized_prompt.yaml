active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given a sudden emergence of a new ransomware threat targeting your industry, debate as a group whether
    to elevate it to a PIR over an ongoing nation-state espionage campaign, considering resource constraints, business impact,
    and alignment with the Threat Intelligence Lifecycle feedback loop. Support arguments with threat landscape assessments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors from voter-identified misconceptions: (1) Conflating IRs (broad) with PIRs (high-impact)
    or SIRs (granular); (2) Viewing realignment/threat hunting as reactive vs. proactive/adaptive; (3) Ignoring resource constraints
    or business impact; (4) Disconnecting from TI Lifecycle feedback. Ensure distractors are plausible (50-70% likely to trick
    learners) but debunkable via explanations.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Threat Intelligence Frameworks.
  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Priority Realignment Based on Threat Landscape'' (Category: Cybersecurity
  > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Frameworks > 003_Threat Intelligence Lifecycle > Feedback > Priority
  Realignment Based on Threat Landscape).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [REMEMBER: Define key terms... CREATE: Design updated PIRs...] (span all Bloom''s levels).

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to discussion (ransomware vs. espionage debate), peer teaching (hierarchy teach-back),
  problem-solving (healthcare realignment scenario).

  - Scaffolding: Layer 1 (Foundation: definitions), Layer 2 (Components: hierarchy/process), Layer 3 (Implementation: scenarios),
  Layer 4 (Integration: TI Lifecycle/big picture).

  - Research Context: Threat Landscape (threats/TTPs), TI, Hunting (proactive), IRs (broad), PIRs (high-impact), SIRs (granular).
  Realignment process: monitor → assess → update → adjust.


  Follow this exact Flashcard Schema:

  {front: ''Question'', back: {answer: ''...'', explanation: ''... (reference context/layers)'', distractors: {for MCQs: A:''...'',
  B:''...'', etc.}, bloom_level: ''...'', scaffolding_layer: 1-4, active_learning_link: ''...''}}.

  Distractor Protocol: Plausible misconceptions (e.g., IRs=PIRs confusion, reactive hunting).

  Variety: 30% REM/UND, 30% APP/ANA, 20% EVA, 20% CRE; 50% Q&A, 30% MCQ, 20% scenario.

  Big Picture: Emphasize adaptive hunting/resilience.
