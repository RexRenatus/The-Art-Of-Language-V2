  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives** (span Bloom''s): [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - **Active Learning** (inspire cards): [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - **Scaffolding Layers** (distribute coverage): [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE]

  - **Key Content**: CMF (Dragos for ICS visibility/blind spots); TTPs (ATT&CK: Tactics=why, Techniques=how, Sub-techniques=variations,
  Procedures=instances); IoCs (fragile); Analysis Space (time/terrain/behavior); Steps (review/map/assess/prioritize/validate);
  Big Picture (lifecycle feedback for adaptive hunting).

  - Sources: Dragos CMF PDF, MITRE TTP-hunting, RFC9424.


  **Schema**: Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards. Each: {''front'': ''Question'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''blooms_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''1/2/3/4'', ''references'': ''...''}}. Use schema exactly.

  - Balance: 30% Layer1/REMEMBER-UNDERSTAND (Q&A/Cloze), 40% Layer2-3/APPLY-ANALYZE (MCQs), 30% Layer4/EVALUATE-CREATE (scenarios).

  - Distractors (MCQs): 4 options (A-D, mark correct), plausible via protocol: [INSERT FULL DISTRACTOR PROTOCOL FROM ABOVE].

  - Ensure progressive complexity, active recall, spaced repetition optimization (detailed explanations).

  - 20% ICS/OT scenarios. No duplicates; cover all objectives.'
