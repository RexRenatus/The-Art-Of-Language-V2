  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the following: ''Is the Feedback stage the most critical in the TI Lifecycle
    for long-term analysis technique improvement, or should resources prioritize earlier stages like Collection and Analysis?
    Use examples from MITRE ATT&CK TTPs and real-world false positive scenarios to support your position.'' Encourage participants
    to reference voter-suggested feedback loops and ISO 27001 audits.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Threat Intelligence. Topic:
  ''Analysis Technique Improvement'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Frameworks
  > 003_Threat Intelligence Lifecycle > Feedback > Analysis Technique Improvement). Consensus: 100% approval from 7 voters
  emphasizing completeness (full ISO 27001/27002: ISO 27001 ISMS PDCA cycle with audits/management reviews for continual improvement;
  ISO 27002 controls like A.10.7), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression), feedback loops (e.g., false positives, metrics), and 4-layer
  scaffolding.


  Incorporate research: TI (info on threats), Threat Hunting (proactive search), IoCs (compromise evidence), IoAs (attack
  intent), TTPs (MITRE ATT&CK), NIST CSF (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover), full TI Lifecycle (Planning, Collection,
  Processing, Analysis, Production, Dissemination, Feedback drives improvements).


  Learning Objectives: [insert the 6 objectives above]. Active Learning: Use for context/enrichment. Scaffolding: Generate
  20-30 flashcards progressively (5-8 per layer).


  Output JSON array of flashcards, each matching schema: {front, back: {answer, explanation, distractors}, metadata}.


  Ensure: Varied types (50% MCQ, 30% short answer, 20% scenario). Active recall. Distractors per protocol. Explanations pedagogical,
  source-referenced. Progressive complexity: Layer 1 simple recall, Layer 4 integrative creation scenarios.'
