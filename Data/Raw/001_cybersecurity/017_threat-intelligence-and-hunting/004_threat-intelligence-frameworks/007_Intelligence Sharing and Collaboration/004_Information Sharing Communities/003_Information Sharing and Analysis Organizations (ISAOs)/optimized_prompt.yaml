active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the balance between rapid information sharing in ISAOs and protecting sensitive data privacy.
    Use case studies like the SolarWinds incident to argue for or against stricter trust frameworks, drawing on ISAO 100-2
    guidelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., ignores trust), 3) Extreme/misconception (e.g., no standards needed). Ensure plausibility from voter-noted errors
    like ISAO/ISAC confusion.'

  \nIncorporate this comprehensive content:\n- Foundation: Definitions (ISAOs for cyber risk sharing, threat intel, trust;\
  \ sources: isao.org).\n- Components: Standards – ISAO 100-1 (Intro), 100-2 (Establishing guidelines, trust focus; https://www.isao.org/isao-100-2...),\
  \ 300-1 (Sharing intro), 300-2 (Automated sharing via STIX/TAXII; complete details: enables machine-readable intel exchange).\n\
  - Implementation: Joining steps, best practices, examples (Auto-ISAC).\n- Integration: Links to STIX/TAXII, MITRE ATT&CK,\
  \ ISACs.\n\nLearning Objectives: [Insert full list from above].\nActive Learning: Use for tie-ins [discussion, peer teaching,\
