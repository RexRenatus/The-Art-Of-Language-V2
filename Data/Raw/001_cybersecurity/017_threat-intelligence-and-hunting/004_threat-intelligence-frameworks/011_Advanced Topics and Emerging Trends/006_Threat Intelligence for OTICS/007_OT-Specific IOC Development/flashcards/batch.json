      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Bastion hosts are specialized, highly secured systems designed to be the sole controlled entry point into sensitive network segments like OT. By centralizing and monitoring all traffic, they act as a critical security layer, preventing unauthorized access and lateral movement from less trusted networks (like IT) into the OT environment.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors mischaracterize bastion hosts as general internet gateways, patch management tools, or data storage devices, failing to recognize their specific role as hardened, monitored access points for critical network segments.",
        "analogy": "A bastion host is like the heavily guarded main gate to a secure facility. All visitors must pass through this gate, be identified, and have their purpose verified before being allowed further access, preventing unauthorized individuals from wandering freely."
