active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare MITRE ATT&CK for Containers with the standard Enterprise matrix. Which container-specific TTPs
    (e.g., image poisoning, kubelet exploits) pose the greatest risk in Kubernetes environments, and why? Debate mitigation
    strategies such as runtime security tools (e.g., Falco) versus network policies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Research Context: Containerization packages apps with dependencies (images: read-only templates; containers: instances;
  runtimes: Docker/containerd; orchestrators: Kubernetes). Security covers lifecycle (build/ship/run). TI: actionable threat
  info; Hunting: proactive searches. Key frameworks: MITRE ATT&CK for Containers (TTPs like image poisoning, pod escapes);
  NIST SP 800-190 (container security guide: threats, controls); SP 800-123 (server security). Real-world: Codecov 2021 breach.
