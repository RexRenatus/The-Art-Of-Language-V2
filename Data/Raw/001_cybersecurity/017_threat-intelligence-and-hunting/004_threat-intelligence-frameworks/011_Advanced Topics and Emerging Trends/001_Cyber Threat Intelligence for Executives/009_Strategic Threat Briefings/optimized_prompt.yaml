active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: As an executive, how would you prioritize resource allocation based on a strategic threat briefing highlighting
    LOTL techniques by state-sponsored actors? Debate the trade-offs between investing in detection tools vs. strategic intelligence
    gathering.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2. Partial truth from lower layers (e.g., MITRE tactic name but wrong sub-technique).

    3. Real-world foil from research (e.g., outdated NIST ref or non-LOTL example).

    Ensure distractors test nuance, not trivia.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for university-level cybersecurity education on 'Strategic Threat Briefings'\
  \ (Category: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Frameworks > 015_011_Advanced Topics\
  \ and Emerging Trends > Cyber Threat Intelligence for Executives > Strategic Threat Briefings).\n\nPrerequisites: Basic\
  \ cybersecurity terms, executive risk awareness; builds on prior MITRE ATT&CK/threat intel modules.\nBig Picture: Strategic\
  \ briefings top the threat intel pyramid, aiding CISO mastery via executive insights (e.g., LOTL trends per CISA).\n\nUse\
  \ these EXACT learning objectives [insert learning_objectives array], active learning components [insert active_learning\
  \ object], and 4-layer scaffolding [insert full scaffolding object including all layers/content] to generate flashcards.\n\
  \nSources: CISA LOTL Guidance (https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-03/Joint-Guidance-Identifying-and-Mitigating-LOTL508.pdf),\

  \ NIST SP 800-150.\n\nGenerate 30 high-quality flashcards (5-6 per Bloom's level, covering all layers proportionally; include\
  \ 20% scenario-based for active learning tie-in). Optimize for Anki/Spaced Repetition: Promote active recall, Bloom's progression,\
  \ scaffolding (reference prior layers).\n\nOutput STRICTLY as JSON array: [\n  {\n    \"question\": \"Stem here?\",\n  \

  \ questions scaffold (Layer 1 basic recall → Layer 4 synthesis), distractors per protocol, explanations pedagogical with\
  \ ties to discussion/problem-solving."
