  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Business Risk Translation is more important than raw
    threat intelligence for securing C-level buy-in.'' Provide 3 arguments for and against, referencing NIST CSF and real-world
    case studies like ransomware attacks.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate exactly 3 distractors per card: 1) Common misconception (e.g., equates TI directly to risk
    without translation); 2) Partial truth (e.g., mentions financial but ignores reputational); 3) Framework mix-up (e.g.,
    confuses NIST CSF with ISO 27001). Ensure distractors are realistic, derived from voter consensus errors, and explained
    to reinforce learning.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Threat Intelligence Frameworks.
  Topic: Business Risk Translation (exact hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence
  Frameworks > 001_Intelligence Types and Classification > Strategic Intelligence > Business Risk Translation). Use university
  pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives (as listed), 4-layer scaffolding (as detailed), active learning ties (e.g., reference
  discussion examples), and voter consensus (completeness with NIST CSF/SP 800-161, examples like ransomware, measurable outcomes,
  concept map flow: TI input → frameworks → business output).


  Big picture: Enables C-level buy-in by translating technical threats (TTPs/IoCs) to business risks (financial/operational/reputational).
  Prerequisites: Strategic Intelligence basics.


  Core knowledge: Business Risk Translation bridges technical TI to business metrics using NIST CSF (Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover)
  and NIST SP 800-161 (supply chain). Steps: Gather TI → Map assets → Quantify impacts → Prioritize.


  Generate exactly 50 flashcards following the schema: Front (Q), Back (answer + exactly 3 distractors w/ explanations + Bloom
  level + layer + hierarchy_tags). Ensure distractors per protocol. Vary formats: 30% MCQ (4 options), 40% cloze, 30% short
  answer. Balance: 10 cards/Bloom level, even layers, 5+ ransomware cases. Output as JSON array of objects. Make educational,
  active (e.g., ''Apply by translating...''), and optimized for Anki/Quizlet.'
