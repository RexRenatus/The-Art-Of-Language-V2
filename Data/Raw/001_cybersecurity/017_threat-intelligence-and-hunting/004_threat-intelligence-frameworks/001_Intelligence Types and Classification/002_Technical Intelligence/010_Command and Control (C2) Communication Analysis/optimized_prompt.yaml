  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, compare C2 evasion techniques (e.g., LOTL using cloud services) with legitimate
    network behaviors (e.g., software updates). Debate: ''How can defenders differentiate without false positives?'' Support
    arguments with MITRE ATT&CK TA0011 examples and real-world dwell time impacts.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    1. Common misconception (e.g., ''All periodic traffic is beaconing'' – distractor: Windows Update).

    2. Related but incorrect term (e.g., confuse TA0011 with TA0001 Initial Access).

    3. Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''C2 always uses encryption'' – ignore domain generation). Ensure distractors
    are realistic from research/voter inputs, promoting analysis.'

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full array from above].

  - Active Learning: [insert full active_learning object from above] – tie cards to these.

  - Scaffolding: [insert full scaffolding object from above] – distribute cards: 10 Layer 1, 15 Layer 2, 15 Layer 3, 20 Layer
  4.

  - Prior Knowledge: Builds on Technical Intelligence (network artifacts analysis).

  - Accuracy: MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise Tactic TA0011 (Command and Control). Key concepts: Beaconing, LOTL, dwell time, OpenC2
  (defensive standard: producers/consumers, JSON commands, profiles e.g., Linux).

  - Misconceptions: Not all periodic traffic is C2 (e.g., updates).


  Generate flashcards using this exact schema: [insert full flashcard_schema from above].


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"front": "Question text with A/B/C/D options", "back": "Correct answer
  (e.g., A) + Explanation + Source/Tie-in"}. Ensure progression through Bloom''s (10 cards/level), high-quality distractors,
  and university pedagogy for retention.'
