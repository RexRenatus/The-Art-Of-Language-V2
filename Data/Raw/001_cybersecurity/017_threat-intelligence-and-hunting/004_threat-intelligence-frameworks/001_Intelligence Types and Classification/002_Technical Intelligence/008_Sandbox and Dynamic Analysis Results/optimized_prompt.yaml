  discussion_prompt: 'Discuss in groups: ''In what scenarios might malware evade sandbox detection (e.g., environmental checks),
    and how can threat hunters integrate dynamic results with static analysis and frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK or the Diamond
    Model to mitigate this? Provide real-world examples.'' Encourage critical thinking on limitations and mitigations.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., ''Dynamic analysis examines code without execution'' - confuses with static); 2) Partial truths (e.g., ''Sandbox
    always detects C2'' - ignores evasion); 3) Opposites/extremes (e.g., ''Sandbox is unsafe for production'' vs. isolated);
    4) Related but wrong concepts (e.g., wrong MITRE technique). Ensure 1 correct is unambiguous. Mark correct with **.'
