This practice significantly increases the attack surface because a compromise of one workstation could grant an attacker access to numerous systems, facilitating lateral movement. Because these credentials are easily discoverable and universally applied, they present a direct pathway for unauthorized access and privilege escalation.",

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Insufficient network segmentation between IT and OT environments means that security boundaries are weak or non-existent, allowing threats from the less secure IT network to potentially reach critical OT systems. Because OT systems often control physical processes, a compromise could lead to safety risks, operational disruptions, or equipment damage. This highlights the critical need for robust segmentation to contain threats and protect industrial control systems.",
