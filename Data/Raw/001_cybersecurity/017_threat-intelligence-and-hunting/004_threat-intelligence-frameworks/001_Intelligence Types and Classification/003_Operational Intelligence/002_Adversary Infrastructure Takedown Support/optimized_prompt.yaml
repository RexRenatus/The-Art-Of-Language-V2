active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a think-pair-share activity, discuss and debate the ethical and legal challenges of conducting adversary
    infrastructure takedowns. Consider scenarios where takedowns might inadvertently affect legitimate users or international
    jurisdictions. Share and refine arguments as a class, addressing misconceptions like confusing takedowns with illegal
    hacking.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate exactly 3 plausible distractors per card: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuses takedown
    with hacking), 2) Partial truth (e.g., omits framework integration), 3) Unrelated concept (e.g., from endpoint security).
    Provide brief explanation for each distractor on why it is incorrect. Ensure distractors are realistic based on research
    context (ATT&CK, Kill Chain).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 20-30 high-quality MCQ flashcards
  on ''Adversary Infrastructure Takedown Support'' using the exact topic_hierarchy: ''Level 1: Cybersecurity > Level 2: Threat
  Intelligence And Hunting > Level 3: Threat Intelligence Frameworks > Level 4: 001_Intelligence Types and Classification
  > Level 5: Operational Intelligence > Level 6: Adversary Infrastructure Takedown Support''. Integrate web research: Definitions
  (adversary infrastructure: servers/domains/IPs/C2/botnets; takedowns via ISP/legal collab); Frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK for
  tactics, Cyber Kill Chain for stages). Builds on prior operational intelligence classification.


  Learning Objectives (span all Bloom''s): [insert full list above]. Scaffolding Layers: [insert full list above]. Active
  Learning: Embed ties (e.g., ''Relates to problem-solving exercise IOCs'').
