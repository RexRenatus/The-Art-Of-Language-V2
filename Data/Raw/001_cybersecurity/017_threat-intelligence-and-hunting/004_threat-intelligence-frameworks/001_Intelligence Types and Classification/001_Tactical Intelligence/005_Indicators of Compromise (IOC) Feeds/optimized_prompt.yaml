active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Using the Pyramid of Pain model, debate in groups which types of IOCs (e.g., IP addresses vs. TTPs) provide
    the most strategic value for defenders and why adversaries find some easier to change. Address common misconceptions,
    such as confusing IOCs with durable TTPs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on\
  \ 'Indicators of Compromise (IOC) Feeds' using the exact topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting\
  \ > Threat Intelligence Frameworks > 001_Intelligence Types and Classification > Tactical Intelligence > Indicators of Compromise\
  \ (IOC) Feeds.\n\nIncorporate:\n- Research: IOC types (IPs, hashes SHA-256/MD5, URLs, domains, YARA, SNI, certs, beaconing);\
  \ Pyramid of Pain (Hashes low, TTPs high); IoC Lifecycle (discovery-validation-sharing-enrichment-deployment-detection-response-retirement);\
  \ STIX 2.1 (SDOs: Indicator/Observed Data; SCOs: IPv4/File/Url; Patterning: '[file:hashes.'SHA-256' = 'abc123]'); Sources:\
  \ OASIS STIX, MISP, OTX, Abuse.ch, RFC9424.\n- Learning Objectives: [Insert full list above].\n- Scaffolding: Strictly 4\
  \ layers [Insert full scaffolding].\n- Active Learning: Draw from discussion (Pyramid debate), peer teaching (STIX), problem-solving\
  \ (SolarWinds STIX hunt).\n- Assessments: Include MCQs with 3 distractors/explanations targeting misconceptions (IOCs vs\
  \ TTPs, hash durability).\n\nOutput ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards, each as:\n{\n  'id': 1,\n  'type': 'MCQ' or 'Q&A',\n\
