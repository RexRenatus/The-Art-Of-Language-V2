      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Insufficient network segmentation between IT and OT environments poses a significant risk because attackers can exploit this lack of separation to move laterally from compromised IT systems to critical OT systems. This allows them to bypass security controls and potentially cause physical disruption, as attackers can leverage access gained in the IT network to reach and manipulate sensitive OT infrastructure, thus undermining real-time blocking efforts that may be focused only on the IT segment.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly suggest segmentation causes isolation, reverses dependency issues, or makes blocking impossible due to protocol differences, failing to identify the core risk of lateral movement from IT to OT due to poor segmentation.",
        "analogy": "Without proper walls and doors (segmentation) between your house (IT) and your workshop (OT), a burglar who gets into the house can easily access the workshop and cause damage there too."
