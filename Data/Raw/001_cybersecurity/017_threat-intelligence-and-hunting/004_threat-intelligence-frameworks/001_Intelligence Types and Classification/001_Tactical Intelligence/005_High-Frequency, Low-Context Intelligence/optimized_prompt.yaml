active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a fast-evolving cyber threat landscape, debate the scenarios where high-frequency, low-context intelligence
    (e.g., raw IOCs) is more valuable than low-frequency, high-context intelligence (e.g., detailed TTP analysis). Use examples
    from the CTI lifecycle or MITRE ATT&CK to support your position. Address misconceptions that volume equals value.
  peer_teaching: Students pair up; one explains 'high-frequency, low-context intelligence' with IOC examples (e.g., IP addresses,
    hashes from real-time feeds), the partner explains its limitations and contrasts with TTPs, then switch roles and use
    teach-back (e.g., partner summarizes key points) to verify understanding.
  problem_solving: Provide students with a simulated feed of 20 IOCs (e.g., domains, hashes, IPs). In small groups, prioritize
    them, contextualize using Cyber Kill Chain stages, and propose mitigation steps. Builds practical threat hunting skills
    with real-world application.

    ''Always superior due to speed''). 2) Mix with TTPs/high-context (e.g., ''Includes adversary intent''). 3) Ignore frameworks
    (e.g., ''No relation to CTI Lifecycle''). Ensure distractors are realistic from voter/research (e.g., IOC vs TTP errors).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Threat Intelligence. Topic:
  ''High-Frequency, Low-Context Intelligence'' (Category: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence
  Frameworks > 001_Intelligence Types and Classification > Tactical Intelligence > High-Frequency, Low-Context Intelligence).
  Consensus: 100% approval from 7 voters.


  Incorporate:

  - Research: HF-LC intel = rapid, low-analysis raw data (IOCs: IPs, hashes, domains) vs TTPs. CTI Lifecycle (Collection/Processing
  heavy). Sources: AlienVault OTX, MISP.
