  discussion_prompt: 'Debate in groups: Does a public cybersecurity blog post detailing common phishing tactics (no specific
    IOCs or targets) qualify as TLP:CLEAR? Justify using risk of misuse criteria, and discuss if any details might warrant
    upgrading to TLP:GREEN. Reference CISA TLP 2.0 guidelines.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives [insert learning_objectives array here]; active learning inspirations
  [insert active_learning object here] for question ideas (e.g., classification scenarios, debates as eval Qs); 4-layer scaffolding
  [insert scaffolding object here] to ensure coverage (Layer 1: 20%, Layer 2: 25%, Layer 3: 30%, Layer 4: 25%).


  Voter consensus (100%): Emphasize completeness (sources/links), pedagogy (Bloom''s, scaffolding, prior knowledge), related
  concepts (TLP table), MCQs with distractors, examples.

  Research: TLP by FIRST; CISA TLP 2.0 (Nov 2022) renamed WHITE to CLEAR; sources as in scaffolding.


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards (10 MCQ, 10 definition/cloze, 10 application/analyze/eval/create). Balance: 1-2 per
  objective; progressive difficulty (foundation to integration).


  Strictly follow flashcard_schema [insert schema here]: Output as JSON array of objects: [{''type'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'':
  ''REMEMBER|...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''1|...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'':
  [''A'', ''B'', ''C''] (for MCQ only), ''related_objective'': ''#1|...''}].


  Ensure: Distractors per protocol; explanations with feedback/sources/examples; no spoilers on front; optimized for Anki/Quizlet
  (concise, active recall); misconceptions addressed (e.g., CLEAR != public domain fully, copyright applies).'
