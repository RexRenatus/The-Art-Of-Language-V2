active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the risks of over-classifying intelligence as TLP:RED versus under-classifying
    as TLP:WHITE. Use real-world examples from sources like FIRST.org/TLP to support arguments on impacts to collective defense
    in cybersecurity.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - D1: Common misconception (e.g., ''TLP:RED can be shared with partners'' – confuses with AMBER).

    - D2: Inverse rule (e.g., overly permissive/restrictive).

    - D3: Non-TLP concept (e.g., mix with U.S. classification like ''SECRET''). Base on voter-noted misconceptions and research
    (e.g., sharing violations).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university-style pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic ''TLP Integration in Intelligence
  Reports'' (Category: Cybersecurity, Domain: Threat Intelligence And Hunting, Subdomain: Threat Intelligence Frameworks,
  Entry: 006_Intelligence Standards and Data Exchange, Entry Subdomain: Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)).


  **Voter Consensus (82.9% approval)**: Emphasize completeness (full TLP definitions, best practices: ''Producers/consumers
  MUST adhere'', real-world/STIX examples, sources: [FIRST TLP](https://www.first.org/tlp/), [STIX 2.1](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/os/stix-v2.1-os.html));
  pedagogy (Bloom''s progression, 4-layer scaffolding, active learning, prior CTI links).


  **Learning Objectives** (span Bloom''s): [insert array from above].

  **Active Learning** (integrate prompts): [insert active_learning object].

  **Scaffolding** (4 layers, 20-30% cards per layer): [insert scaffolding object].


  **Content Synthesis**: Use provided research (TLP colors/rules, CTI/CTI reports, STIX marking-definitions). Ensure flashcards
