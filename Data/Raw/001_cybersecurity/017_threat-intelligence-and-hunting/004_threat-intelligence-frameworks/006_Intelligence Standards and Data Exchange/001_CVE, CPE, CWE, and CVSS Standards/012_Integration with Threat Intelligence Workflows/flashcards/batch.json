        "core_logic": "The STIX Best Practices Guide strongly recommends populating optional properties on SDOs and SROs whenever feasible. This enriches the objects with valuable context, making them more informative and useful for analysis, correlation, and decision-making within threat intelligence workflows. The goal is to maximize the utility of STIX data, not to minimize its content.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors suggest limiting optional properties based on minimal necessity, size concerns, or trust group mandates, contradicting the best practice of populating them to enhance the informativeness and utility of STIX objects.",
        "analogy": "When filling out a form, you wouldn't just put the bare minimum required fields if there are extra boxes for helpful details (like 'emergency contact' or 'preferred method'). Filling those optional boxes makes the form much more useful."
