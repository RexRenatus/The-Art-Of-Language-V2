active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the effectiveness of the CWE Top 25 in guiding organizational security priorities versus the need
    for industry-specific tailoring. Use recent CVE examples from NVD (e.g., referencing View-1003 mappings) to support arguments,
    considering factors like prevalence, impact, and evolving threats.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (2) Similar CWEs from Top 25 (e.g., CWE-79 XSS vs. CWE-89 SQLi); (3) Related terms (CPE, CVSS, NVD views). Ensure distractors
    test subtle differences and link to threat intel implications.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom''s Taxonomy, active
  recall, and spaced repetition (Anki-compatible). Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Common Weakness Enumeration
  (CWE) Classification'' in Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Frameworks > 006_Intelligence
  Standards and Data Exchange > CVE, CPE, CWE, and CVSS Standards > CWE Classification.


  Incorporate these elements:

  - LEARNING OBJECTIVES: [Paste the full learning_objectives array here]. Ensure coverage across all levels.

  - ACTIVE LEARNING: Use concepts from discussion, peer teaching, and problem-solving for higher-level cards (apply/analyze/evaluate/create).

  - SCAFFOLDING: Distribute cards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4.

  - RESEARCH CONTEXT: CWE: Community list of 944 weaknesses (Nov 2024); Top 25 (2025 list prioritizes by CVE frequency/impact);
  NVD uses CWE mappings (View-1003 for CWE-specific CVE views); Root cause mapping links CWE (weaknesses) to CVE (vulnerabilities).
  Sources: cwe.mitre.org, nvd.nist.gov.

  - CONCEPT MAP: Central CWE → Weakness → CVE (NVD); Top 25; NVD View-1003.

  - PRIOR KNOWLEDGE: Builds on CVE (instances), CVSS (scoring).
