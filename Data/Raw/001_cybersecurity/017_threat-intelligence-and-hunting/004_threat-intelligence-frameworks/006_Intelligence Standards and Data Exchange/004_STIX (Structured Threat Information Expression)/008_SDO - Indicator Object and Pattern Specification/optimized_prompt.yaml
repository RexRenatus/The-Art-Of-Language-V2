active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss how STIX Indicators fit into threat hunting pipelines and intel sharing platforms like MISP or
    AlienVault OTX. How does the 'pattern' property enable SIEM correlation compared to traditional IOC formats?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Topic: SDO: Indicator Object and Pattern Specification (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat
  Intelligence Frameworks > 006_Intelligence Standards and Data Exchange > STIX > SDO: Indicator Object and Pattern Specification).
  Consensus: 100% approval on completeness (full STIX Patterning Language: Observation Expressions like [file:hashes.''SHA-256''
  = ''abc123''], Qualification like AND/OR; examples: [ipv4-addr:value = ''1.2.3.4''] OR [...]); pedagogy (Bloom''s objectives,
  4 layers, prior knowledge: SDOs/SCOs/Bundles/IOCs, big picture: threat hunting/SIEM/MISP/OTX).


  Generate 30-50 flashcards using the exact schema: {front: ''...'', back: {answer: ''...'', explanation: ''...'', hints:
  [...], source: ''...''}}. Distribute: 40% MCQ (distractors: property confusion like pattern vs valid_from, syntax/PCRE mix-up),
  30% Q&A, 15% cloze, 15% application. Align to objectives [insert learning_objectives list], layers [insert scaffolding],
  active learning for realism.


  Incorporate: Properties (type=''indicator'', pattern required, pattern_type=''stix'', valid_from/until, indicates); Patterns
  (full syntax, comparisons =/!=/> etc.); JSON examples; misconceptions (pattern != created_by_ref/marking_refs). Ensure university
  pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, progressive complexity. Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards.'
