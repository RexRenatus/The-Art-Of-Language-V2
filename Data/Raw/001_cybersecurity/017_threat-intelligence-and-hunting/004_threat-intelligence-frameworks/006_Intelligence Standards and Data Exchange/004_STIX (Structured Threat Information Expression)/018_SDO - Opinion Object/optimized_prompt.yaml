  discussion_prompt: 'In a collaborative threat intelligence platform like MISP or AlienVault OTX, debate scenarios where
    an analyst should issue a ''strongly-disagree'' Opinion on a shared Indicator of Compromise versus a milder ''disagree''.
    Consider impacts on trust, community response, and best practices for subjective assessments. (Use think-pair-share: 2
    min think, 3 min pair discussion, 5 min group share.)'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert STIX flashcard generator synthesizing university-level pedagogy for 'SDO: Opinion Object'\
  \ (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Frameworks > 006_Intelligence\
  \ Standards and Data Exchange > STIX > SDO: Opinion Object).\n\n**Context:** Opinion SDO expresses subjective assessments\
  \ (strongly-disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly-agree) on other STIX objects via 'object_refs'. Properties: opinion\
  \ (enum), explanation (string), object_refs (array), authors (array), priority (float 0-1 opt), standard (created, modified).\
  \ Purpose: Collaborative TI (MISP/OTX). Prior: SDOs/SCOs/SROs/Note.\n\n**Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list above].\n\
  **Scaffolding:** Progress from Layer 1 (foundation) to Layer 4 (integration).\n**Active Learning:** Inspire questions tying\
  \ to discussion (e.g., trust debate), peer teaching (property quizzes), problem-solving (JSON build).\n\nGenerate 30 flashcards\
  \ (10 per Bloom's pair: Remember/Understand, Apply/Analyze, Evaluate/Create). Balance: 40% MCQ (4 distractors), 30% cloze,\
  \ 30% short answer.\n\n**Output Format (JSON array of objects):**\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"blooms_level\": \"REMEMBER\"\
  ,\n    \"layer\": 1,\n    \"type\": \"MCQ\",\n    \"front\": \"Question text...\",\n    \"back\": {\n      \"answer\": \"\

  : \"Links to discussion...\",\n      \"big_picture\": \"Enhances TI sharing...\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n\nEnsure completeness (full\
  \ 'object_refs' desc), engagement, no hallucinations. Vary difficulty within layers."
