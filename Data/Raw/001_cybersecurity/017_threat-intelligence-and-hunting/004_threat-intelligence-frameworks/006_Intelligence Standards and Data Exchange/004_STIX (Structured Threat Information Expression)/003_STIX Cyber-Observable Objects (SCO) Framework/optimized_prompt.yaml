  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the importance of SCO standardization for interoperability in threat hunting:
    How does using SCOs in STIX prevent misinterpretation of observables across tools like SIEMs and EDRs? Provide examples
    from real-world CTI sharing via TAXII.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
