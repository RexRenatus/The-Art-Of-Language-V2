active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages of using STIX Attack Patterns over unstructured descriptions
    in threat intelligence sharing. Provide examples from real-world threat hunting scenarios and reference how they integrate
    with MITRE ATT&CK.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Plausible misconceptions: e.g., Confuse ''kill_chain_phases'' with ''external_references''; mix STIX 1.x vs 2.x properties.'
    - 'Similar terms: e.g., ''Indicator'' vs ''Attack Pattern''; ''CAPEC'' vs ''CWE''.'
    - 'Edge cases: Optional vs required properties; invalid JSON structures.'
    - 'Common errors: Wrong spec_version (e.g., 2.0 vs 2.1); missing ''type'' field.'
    - 'Balance: 1 highly plausible, 1 superficially similar, 1 unrelated.'
    coverage: Distribute across Bloom's levels; 40% MCQ with distractors.

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Tie explanations to discussion/peer teaching/problems.

  - Scaffolding: Ensure cards progress from Layer 1 (Foundation) to Layer 4 (Integration).

  - Sources: Always cite OASIS STIX 2.1 spec, CAPEC website, MITRE ATT&CK.


  Follow this exact output format: JSON array of objects, each with ''front'', ''back'' (nested object with ''answer'', ''explanation'',
  ''source'', ''related_objective'', ''difficulty''), ''type'' (''cloze''|''mcq''|''short_answer''), ''layer'' (1-4), ''bloom_level''.


  Use Flashcard Schema: [INSERT FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Ensure distractors follow protocol for MCQs. Cards must be precise,
  use real JSON examples, promote active recall. Generate 40 cards balanced by Bloom''s levels and layers. Prioritize hands-on
  JSON creation for Apply/Create levels.'
