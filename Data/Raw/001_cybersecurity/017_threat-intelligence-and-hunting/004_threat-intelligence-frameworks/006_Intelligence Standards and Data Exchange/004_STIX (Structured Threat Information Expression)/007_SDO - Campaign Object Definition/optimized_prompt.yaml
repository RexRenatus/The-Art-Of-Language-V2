  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active learning: Ensure cards support discussion/problem-solving (e.g., scenario cards).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers: [PASTE FULL LAYER DESCRIPTIONS FROM ABOVE]. Tag each card with layer.

  - Key content: STIX 2.1 properties (name:str, description:str, first_seen:timestamp, last_seen:timestamp, objective:str,
  status:enum(ongoing|success|compromised|hiatus), etc.); differences vs. Intrusion Set; relationships (attributed-to Threat
  Actor, uses TTPs/Malware); examples (SolarWinds, NotPetya); prior knowledge (STIX basics, Threat Actor).

  - Sources: OASIS STIX 2.1 Spec, STIX GitHub.


  Follow flashcard schema exactly: [PASTE FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Output as JSON array of objects, each with ''type'', ''front'',
  ''back'' (nested object), ''bloom_level'', ''layer'', ''tags'' (e.g., [''real-world'', ''JSON'']). Use distractor protocol
  for MCQs. Cards must be precise, educational, and spaced for active recall. No duplicates; vary phrasing.'
