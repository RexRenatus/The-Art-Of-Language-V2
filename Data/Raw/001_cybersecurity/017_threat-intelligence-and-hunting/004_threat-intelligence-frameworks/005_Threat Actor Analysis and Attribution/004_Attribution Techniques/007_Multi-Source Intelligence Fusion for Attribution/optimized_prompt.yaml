active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges of achieving high-confidence attribution in real-world incidents
    like the SolarWinds supply chain attack. How does multi-source fusion mitigate issues like adversary obfuscation (e.g.,
    proxies, false flags)? Support arguments with examples from MITRE ATT&CK or Cyber Kill Chain.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truth (e.g., single-source example); 3) Inverse error (e.g., high-confidence for low-overlap data). Ensure
    distractors test nuance in fusion/attribution.'
