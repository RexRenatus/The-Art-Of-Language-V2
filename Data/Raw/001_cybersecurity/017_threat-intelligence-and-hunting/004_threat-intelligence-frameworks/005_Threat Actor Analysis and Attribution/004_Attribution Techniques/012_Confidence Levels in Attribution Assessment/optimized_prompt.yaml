active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the implications of publicly reporting 'Low Confidence' attribution to
    a state actor (e.g., in the SolarWinds case). What are the risks to national security vs. benefits for transparency? Support
    with examples of estimative language misuse.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
