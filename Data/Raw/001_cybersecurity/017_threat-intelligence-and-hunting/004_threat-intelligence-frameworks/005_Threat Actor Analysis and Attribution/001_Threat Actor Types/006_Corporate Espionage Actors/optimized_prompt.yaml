active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the relative risks of insider threats versus nation-state actors in corporate
    espionage. Use real-world examples (e.g., SolarWinds supply chain attack) to argue which is harder to detect and why,
    citing detection challenges and mitigation trade-offs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - Active Learning: [paste the active_learning object here]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste the scaffolding_layers array here]

  - Prior Knowledge: Builds on basic threat actors and attribution.

  - Full Content: Core concepts (corporate espionage, IP theft); Actors (disgruntled insiders: revenge, exfiltration; nation-states:
  APTs like APT41; competitors: social engineering; supply chain: SolarWinds); Tactics (phishing, malware, dumpster diving);
  Hunting (UEBA, EDR); Sources (Mandiant, CrowdStrike, MITRE ATT&CK, CISA).

  - Concept Map: As in Layer 1.
