active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of defanging URLs in threat reports (e.g., safety vs. usability
    for analysts). Provide real-world examples from phishing campaigns and evaluate how standards like STIX 2.1 address this.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
