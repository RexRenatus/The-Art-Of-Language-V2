      "correct_answer": "Because using common tools like <code>tasklist.exe</code> or <code>powershell.exe</code> helps adversaries blend in with normal network activity, making detection more challenging.",
      "distractors": [
        {
          "text": "Because these utilities are always the first step in any malware infection.",

          "text": "Because these utilities are typically unpatched and vulnerable.",

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Adversaries leverage legitimate system utilities for Process Discovery because their normal usage provides a cover, making it difficult for security tools to distinguish malicious reconnaissance from legitimate administrative tasks, thus aiding in defense evasion.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors misrepresent the reason by focusing on malware infection order, utility vulnerabilities, or privilege acquisition, rather than the core threat intelligence insight that legitimate tool usage aids adversary stealth.",
        "analogy": "It's like a spy using a regular postal service to send coded messages; the postal service itself is legitimate and widely used, making it hard to flag the specific message as suspicious."
