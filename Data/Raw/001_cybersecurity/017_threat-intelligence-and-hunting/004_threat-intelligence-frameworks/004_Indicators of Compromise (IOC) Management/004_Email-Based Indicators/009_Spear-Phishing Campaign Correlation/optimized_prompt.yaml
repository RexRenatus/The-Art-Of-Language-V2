active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare the reliability of IoCs versus TTPs in correlating spear-phishing campaigns. Using real-world
    cases like the 2020 Twitter Bitcoin scam, debate their strengths, limitations, and when to prioritize one over the other
    in threat hunting.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Confusable term (e.g., IoC vs TTP); 3) Partial truth (e.g., valid for broad phishing but not spear). Base on real pitfalls
    from sources like MITRE ATT&CK.'

  **Research Context (Complete):** Spear-phishing: Targeted phishing using personalized lures (MITRE T1566.001/002). Campaigns:
  Series sharing TTPs/IoCs. TI/CTI: Evidence-based threat knowledge. Threat Hunting: Hypothesis-driven search. Frameworks:
  MITRE ATT&CK (Phishing matrix), Diamond Model. Best Practices: Cluster IoCs (domains/IPs/hashes) via MISP/ThreatConnect;
  prioritize TTPs over ephemeral IoCs; validate with behavioral analysis. Industry Standards: NIST SP 800-150 (TI), MITRE
  Engage. Concept Map: Central ''Correlation'' → TTPs (stable) → IoCs (email-specific) → TI → Hunting. Sources: MITRE.org/attack-matrix/enterprise/phishing,
  researchsquare.com/rs-7349090, NIST.gov.

  - Scaffolding: [Insert full scaffolding object here, including prerequisites].

  - Active Learning: Tie cards to activities, e.g., ''Apply to problem-solving exercise''.


  **Generation Rules:**

  - Use flashcard_schema exactly.

  - Balance: 20% Remember/Understand (Layer 1), 30% Apply/Analyze (Layers 2-3), 30% Evaluate (Layer 4), 20% Create (Integration).

  - Cards: Varied types (Q&A, cloze, scenarios). Incorporate real examples (Twitter scam).

  - Output: JSON array of flashcards. Ensure educational depth, no fluff.'
