        "core_logic": "SCOs are top-level objects in STIX v2.1, unlike the deprecated container, because this structure allows them to be globally referenced and easily deduplicated, which is crucial for efficient threat intelligence sharing and management, since it reduces redundant data and supports common repositories.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors misrepresent SCO benefits as simplicity, inherent encryption, or backward compatibility, failing to grasp their core advantage: global referencing and reduced duplication due to their top-level object status.",
        "analogy": "Using SCOs is like having individual, addressable Lego bricks (SCOs) instead of a jumbled pile (container); you can easily find, reference, and reuse specific bricks without duplicating them."
