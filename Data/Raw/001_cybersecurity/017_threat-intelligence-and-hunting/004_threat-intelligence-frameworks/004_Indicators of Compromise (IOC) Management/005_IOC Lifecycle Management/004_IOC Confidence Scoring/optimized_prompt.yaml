active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how IOC age and source reliability should be weighted in confidence scoring
    during a fast-moving ransomware incident—provide examples from real-world breaches and justify your prioritization.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    factor (e.g., mix source with impact), 3) Extreme value (e.g., always 100/0); base on research/voter factors like GTI
    vs. generic scales; ensure 25% correct by default.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert cybersecurity flashcard generator specializing in Threat Intelligence Frameworks. Generate
  50 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''IOC Confidence Scoring'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And
  Hunting > Threat Intelligence Frameworks > 004_Indicators of Compromise (IOC) Management > IOC Lifecycle Management > IOC
  Confidence Scoring). Ensure 82.9% voter-approved completeness: cover truncated best practices (factors: source reliability,
  IOC age/recency, context specificity; weighted scales; SIEM integration; examples like SHA256 hash vs. suspicious IP; GTI/AIS
  comparisons; threat hunting workflows).


  Incorporate university pedagogy:

  - Learning Objectives (span Bloom''s): [INSERT FULL LIST FROM learning_objectives ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Tie cards to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving (e.g., ''Apply in triage exercise'').

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [INSERT FULL LIST FROM scaffolding ABOVE]; tag each card with layer.


  Use Flashcard Schema [INSERT FULL SCHEMA FROM flashcard_schema ABOVE]: Mix 40% basic/cloze, 60% MCQ. Vary difficulty: 30%
  Remember/Understand (Layer 1-2), 40% Apply/Analyze (Layer 2-3), 30% Evaluate/Create (Layer 3-4). Include concrete examples,
  GTI (0-100 scale), best practices.


  Research Context: IOCs (hashes/IPs/domains per CrowdStrike); Confidence (0-100 malice likelihood); GTI (Google Security
  Ops); integrate SIEM/risk prioritization.
