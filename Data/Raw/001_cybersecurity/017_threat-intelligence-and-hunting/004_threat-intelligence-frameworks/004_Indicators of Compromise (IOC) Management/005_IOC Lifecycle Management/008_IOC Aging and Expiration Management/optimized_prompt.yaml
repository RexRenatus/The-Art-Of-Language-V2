active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of aggressive (short expiration timelines) versus conservative
    (longer timelines) IOC aging policies. Consider impacts on false positives, dwell time reduction, and operational efficiency
    in a threat intelligence team. Provide evidence from real-world examples like file hashes vs. TTPs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the 6 objectives above].

  - Active Learning: [Insert the 3 activities above] for contextual prompts.

  - Scaffolding: Generate 40 flashcards distributed: 10 Layer 1, 10 Layer 2, 10 Layer 3, 10 Layer 4.

  - Prior Knowledge: Assume basics from IOC definitions/lifecycle.

  - Big Picture: Emphasize reducing alert fatigue, dwell time, optimizing TI.

  - Research Context: [Insert full research summary provided]. Complete MITRE ATT&CK: IOCs map to techniques (e.g., aging
  based on tactic changes); Sources: paloaltonetworks.com (IOC defs), rfc-editor.org (lifecycle/fragility), dragos.com (aging),
