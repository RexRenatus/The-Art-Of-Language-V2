        "core_logic": "RFC 9424 notes that while IP addresses and domain names cause more pain for adversaries to change than file hashes, they are still subvertible. This is because adversaries can change IP ranges or providers, but the effort involved is greater than simply recompiling code, making them a mid-tier IoC in terms of adversary pain and fragility.",

        "analogy": "Blocking an IP address or domain is like blocking a specific road to a house; it's more effort for the attacker than changing the house number (hash), but they can still find alternative routes (new IPs/domains)."
