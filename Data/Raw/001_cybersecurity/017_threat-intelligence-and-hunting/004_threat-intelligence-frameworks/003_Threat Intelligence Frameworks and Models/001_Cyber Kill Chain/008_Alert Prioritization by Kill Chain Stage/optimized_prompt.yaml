active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Should alerts from early Cyber Kill Chain stages (e.g., Reconnaissance) be deprioritized compared to
    later stages like C2 or Actions on Objectives? Debate using real-world examples, MITRE ATT&CK mappings, and SOC resource
    constraints. Consider misconceptions like assuming the Kill Chain is strictly linear.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains one Cyber Kill Chain stage, maps 2-3 sample alerts to it, and provides prioritization
    rationale; the partner performs a teach-back quiz with follow-up questions on TTP relationships.
  problem_solving: Provide 8-10 anonymized SIEM alerts (e.g., suspicious DNS queries for Recon, beaconing for C2). In groups,
    categorize by Kill Chain stage, prioritize with impact scoring (low for early stages, high for late), justify decisions,
    and propose disruption strategies integrating threat hunting.

    ''Kill Chain is linear'' → distractor assumes no loops), 2. Partial knowledge (e.g., confuses C2 with Installation), 3.
    Related concepts (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK tactic instead of Kill Chain stage), 4. Real-world edge cases (e.g., low-volume late-stage
    alert). Ensure 1 correct, 3 distractors; mark correct in explanation.'

  Content Context:

  - Cyber Kill Chain (Lockheed Martin): 7 stages - Reconnaissance (passive/active info gathering, e.g., DNS queries), Weaponization
  (exploit/malware assembly), Delivery (phishing/email), Exploitation (code execution), Installation (backdoor/DLL), C2 (beaconing),
  Actions on Objectives (data exfil/lateral movement).

  - Prioritization: Early stages low priority (high volume, low impact); late stages high (disrupt before objectives).

  - MITRE ATT&CK Integration: Kill Chain maps linearly to Tactics (e.g., Recon → Reconnaissance; C2 → Command and Control).

  - Examples: Recon alert (suspicious port scan) → Low; C2 (domain generation) → High.
