active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of using open-source TIPs like MISP versus commercial
    ones like ThreatConnect for Cyber Kill Chain-based threat hunting. How does STIX/TAXII standardization influence your
    choice? Reference real-world examples from Microsoft Sentinel or Splunk integrations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Topic: ''Integration with Threat Intelligence Platforms'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting >
  Threat Intelligence Frameworks > 003_Threat 001_Intelligence Frameworks and Models > Cyber Kill Chain > Integration with
  Threat Intelligence Platforms). Use this optimized learning prompt to generate 25 high-quality flashcards.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the learning_objectives array here].

  **Active Learning Integration:** Ensure flashcards support discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving by including scenario-based
  questions.

  **Scaffolding:** Distribute flashcards across 4 layers: [Insert scaffolding details here].

  **Voter Consensus (82.9% approval):** Emphasize Cyber Kill Chain prior knowledge (map IOCs/TTPs to stages), STIX (structured
  threat intel format), TAXII (exchange protocol), integrations (API, SIEM like Sentinel/Splunk, SOAR, MISP/ThreatConnect
  examples), concept map (TIP Integration central).

  **Research Context:** CTI: threat evidence; TIP: aggregates intel; IOCs: artifacts (IPs/hashes); TTPs: behaviors. Standards:
  STIX/TAXII. Integrations enhance Kill Chain detection.


  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly follow [Insert flashcard_schema here]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcards. No additional
  text.'
