        "core_logic": "Threat hunting for EoP involves actively searching for signs of unauthorized privilege escalation by analyzing system logs for anomalies like unexpected process executions, changes in user rights, or attempts to access restricted files. This is because EoP fundamentally alters a user's or process's permissions on a system.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors describe activities more aligned with hunting for other threats: data exfiltration (Information Disclosure), malware (general threat hunting), and firewall rule analysis (network security). Log analysis for privilege changes is the direct method for hunting EoP.",
        "analogy": "It's like a detective looking for fingerprints or tool marks left at a crime scene (logs of privilege changes) to understand how a burglar gained access, rather than just looking for stolen goods (data exfiltration) or the burglar's tools (malware)."
