active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''DFDs and trust boundary identification in PASTA Stage
    3 are more critical for threat hunting than traditional vulnerability scanning.'' Provide evidence from PASTA methodology
    and real-world examples (e.g., API vulnerabilities in web apps), considering pros, cons, and alternatives.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT ARRAY FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT DETAILS FROM ABOVE] (link flashcards to these)

  - Scaffolding: [INSERT 4 LAYERS FROM ABOVE] (tag each card)

  - Research: Application Decomposition breaks down systems via DFDs, trust boundaries, assets; builds on PASTA 1-2; aligns
  with NIST/OWASP/ISO 27001.

  - Best Practices: Step-by-step DFD creation, boundary ID, asset inventory, examples (web apps, APIs).


  Use exact Flashcard Schema: [INSERT SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards, e.g., [{''front'': ''...'',
  ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ...}, ''metadata'': {...}}, ...]. Balance Bloom''s levels, ensure
  distractors are plausible (misconceptions like ignoring external entities). Make explanations educational, tying to threat
  hunting.'
