  discussion_prompt: 'Debate in groups: For a healthcare organization, should a low-likelihood but catastrophic data breach
    risk be accepted or mitigated first over frequent phishing risks? Justify using likelihood, impact scores, business context,
    and risk treatment options from PASTA Stage 7.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in threat intelligence frameworks\
  \ like PASTA. Generate 75 high-quality flashcards for the topic 'PASTA: Stage 7 - Risk and Impact Analysis' (Category: Cybersecurity\
  \ > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Frameworks > 003_Threat 001_Intelligence Frameworks and Models\
  \ > 005_Threat Modeling Methodologies > PASTA: Stage 7 - Risk and Impact Analysis).\n\nIncorporate these elements:\n- Learning\
  \ Objectives: [REMEMBER: List and define core concepts... CREATE: Formulate a customized risk... ] (paste full list).\n\
  - Scaffolding Layers: [Layer 1: Foundation... Layer 4: Integration] (ensure coverage across layers).\n- Active Learning:\
  \ Tie cards to discussion (healthcare debate), peer teaching (FAIR/ treatments), problem-solving (e-commerce SQLi scenario).\n\
  - Research Context: Core concepts (risk=likelihood x impact, treatments), standards (ISO 31000 evaluation/treatment, NIST\
  \ SP 800-30 risk assessments), best practices (risk matrices, ALE=SLE x ARO, stakeholder involvement, business impact prioritization:\
  \ financial/operational/reputational).\n\nOutput ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards, each following this schema:\n{\n \
  \ \"id\": 1,\n  \"front\": \"Question text\",\n  \"back\": \"Correct answer\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Detailed explanation\
  \ with pedagogy links\",\n  \"distractors\": [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"],\n  \"metadata\": {\"blooms_level\": \"APPLY\", \"scaffolding_layer\"\
  : 3, \"active_learning_link\": \"problem_solving\"}\n}\n\nBalance: 70% basic recall/understand, 20% apply/analyze, 10% evaluate/create.\
  \ Distractors: plausible per protocol. Ensure university-level rigor, active learning prompts, no spoilers in front."
