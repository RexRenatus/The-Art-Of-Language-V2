    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how feedback loops from the Disseminate phase in F3EAD improve the Find
    phase in proactive threat hunting. Use real-world examples like APT campaigns and reference links to frameworks like MITRE
    ATT&CK.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    truth (e.g., name from general TI lifecycle not F3EAD); 3) Plausible alternative (e.g., similar phase like ''Process''
    instead of ''Analyze''). Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter-noted inaccuracies (e.g., general TI vs F3EAD).'

  Incorporate these exactly:

  - Learning objectives: [insert full list from above]

  - Active learning components: [insert summaries of discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving]

  - Scaffolding layers: [insert full layer descriptions]

  - Research context: Align to F3EAD (Find, Fix, Finish, Exploit, Analyze, Disseminate); intelligence products from Analyze
  (transform data) + Disseminate (share, e.g., briefs, IOCs); feedback loops for iteration; sources: cycognito.com/threat-intelligence/,
  military F3EAD refs (e.g., US Army FM 3-05), MITRE ATT&CK.

  - Voter consensus: Focus Analyze/Disseminate; complete feedback (gather consumer input to refine); examples (APT28 briefs);
  links to threat hunting.
