active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the advantages (e.g., faster threat neutralization via F3EAD's Finish/Exploit phases) and challenges
    (e.g., balancing TI's structured Analysis/Production with F3EAD's speed) of integrating the F3EAD cycle with the traditional
    six-phase TI Lifecycle (Direction-Collection-Processing-Analysis-Production-Dissemination/Feedback). Provide real-world
    cybersecurity examples where this integration enhances proactive defense, such as in incident response or hunting persistent
    threats.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Use plausible alternatives: e.g., similar phase names (Exploit vs. Analyze), common misconceptions (TI Feedback as
      linear end vs. loop), partial truths (F3EAD speed ignores strategic depth).'

    - Avoid 'all/none' options; ensure 25% correct rate simulation.
    - 'Tie to voter priorities: Distractors test completeness (missing phases) and integration mappings.'

  Topic: ''Cycle Integration with Traditional Intelligence Lifecycle'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And
  Hunting > Threat Intelligence Frameworks > 003_Threat 001_Intelligence Frameworks and Models > F3EAD Cycle > Cycle Integration
  with Traditional Intelligence Lifecycle). Use provided research context: Complete TI Lifecycle (Direction: PIRs alignment;
  Collection: multi-source data; Processing: clean/normalize/validate; Analysis: contextual fusion; Production: actionable
  products; Dissemination: stakeholder delivery; Feedback: iterative refinement). F3EAD: Find-Fix-Finish-Exploit/Examine-Analyze-Disseminate
  (military rapid cycle).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Active Learning: [insert summaries of discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving]

  - Scaffolding: [insert 4 layers]


  Generate 60-80 high-quality flashcards following the exact schema: 50/50 basic QA and MCQ. Balance Bloom''s levels progressively.
  Use distractor protocol strictly. Ensure completeness: Cover all phases with best practices, explicit F3EAD-TI mappings,
  voter priorities (e.g., similarities/differences, debate points). Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''basic_qa''|''mcq'',
  ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}, ''blooms_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': 1-4, ''topic_hierarchy'': ''Level
  6 Integration''}]. Make explanations educational, tying to real-world cyber threat hunting.'
