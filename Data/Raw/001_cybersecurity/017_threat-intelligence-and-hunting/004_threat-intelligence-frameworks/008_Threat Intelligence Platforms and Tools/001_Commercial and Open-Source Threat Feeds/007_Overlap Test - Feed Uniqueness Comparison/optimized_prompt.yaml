  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Research Context: TI knowledge for threats; Hunting proactive search; Feeds with IOCs/TTPs (e.g., Recorded Future, ThreatConnect
  commercial; AlienVault OTX, MISP open-source). Metrics: Jaccard Index. Tools: Python pandas. Standards: MITRE ATT&CK. Sources:

  Generate flashcards per schema: [PASTE FULL FLASHCARD SCHEMA FROM ABOVE].

  Output ONLY a JSON array of objects, e.g., [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}}]. Ensure completeness, pedagogy (Bloom''s
  progression), voter priorities (examples, MITRE, workflows), and distractor protocol. Cover big picture (TI lifecycle, SOC
  optimization) and concept map (Overlap Test → Feeds → Metrics → Hunting).'
