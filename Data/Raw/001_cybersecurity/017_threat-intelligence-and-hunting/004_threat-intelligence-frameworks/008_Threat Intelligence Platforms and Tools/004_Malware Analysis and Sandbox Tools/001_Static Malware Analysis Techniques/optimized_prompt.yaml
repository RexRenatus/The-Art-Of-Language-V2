active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of relying solely on static analysis for malware triage
    versus combining it with dynamic analysis. Use real-world examples from threat intelligence reports to support your arguments,
    and consider evasion techniques like obfuscation or packing.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    with dynamic tools); 2) Partial truths (e.g., valid dynamic tool as static); 3) Edge cases (e.g., advanced tools for beginners);
    4) Voter-suggested gaps (e.g., incomplete techniques like omitting YARA). Ensure distractors are realistic from research
    context.'

  Incorporate this research context: Static analysis examines files without execution for triage, IOC extraction (hashes MD5/SHA256,
  strings, IPs/domains), functionality insights. Techniques: hashing, ''strings'' extraction, file type ID (''file'', PEiD),
  packer detection, header exam (PEview/PEStudio, hex editors), YARA rules. Frameworks: FIRST Malware Analysis Framework v2.0,
  MITRE ATT&CK. Best practices (zeltser.com): Non-execution, document IOCs, decide on dynamic next steps. Prerequisites: Basic
  IOCs, threat intel concepts.
