active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using public online sandboxes (e.g., Hybrid Analysis,
    Any.Run) versus private setups (e.g., Cuckoo Sandbox) for threat hunting. Consider factors like evasion detection, data
    privacy, and IOC reliability. Provide real-world examples from recent malware campaigns.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the array above]

  - Active Learning: Use for scenario cards (e.g., ''Discuss...'').

  - Scaffolding: [paste the 4 layers above] – Distribute flashcards evenly.

  - Research Context: Dynamic analysis executes malware in isolated sandboxes to observe behaviors/IOCs safely. Complete details
  in scaffolding.


  Generate flashcards following EXACT schema: [paste flashcard_schema.structure]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards,
  e.g., [ {flashcard1}, {flashcard2}, ... ]. Ensure 40-60 cards, high-quality, measurable, tied to objectives/layers. No extra
  text.'
