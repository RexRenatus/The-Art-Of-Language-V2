  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use for scenario-based cards (e.g., ''In a peer teaching activity...'').

  - Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL LAYERS, PREREQS, CONCEPT MAP ABOVE]. Cover all layers progressively.

  - Research Context: Automated detonation = sandbox execution for behavior obs (file/registry/net/process changes, evasion).
  IoCs from analysis feed TTPs/MITRE. Tools: Cuckoo, Joe, VirusTotal. RFC 9424 for automated sharing.


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards:

  - Span all Bloom''s levels (min 4 per level).

  - Balance scaffolding layers.

  - Use Flashcard Schema: [INSERT FULL SCHEMA ABOVE].

  - Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''correct_answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors_explained'':
  {...}}, ''tags'': [''level'', ''layer'', ''concept'']}, ...]

  - Ensure active recall, no hints in front. Pedagogically optimized for spaced repetition.'
