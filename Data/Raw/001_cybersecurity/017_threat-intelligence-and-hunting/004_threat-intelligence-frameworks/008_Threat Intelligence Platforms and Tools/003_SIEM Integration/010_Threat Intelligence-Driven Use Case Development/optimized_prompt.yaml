active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the misconception that 'Threat Intelligence is only about IOCs' versus
    its inclusion of TTPs and strategic insights. Provide real-world examples of how Tactical TI reduces false positives in
    SIEM use cases, and link to prior knowledge of basic SIEM integration.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truth (e.g., mixes Tactical with Operational), 3) Extreme/unrealistic (e.g., ignores SIEM integration). Ensure
    plausibility from research context or voter suggestions.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards
  for the topic ''Threat Intelligence-Driven Use Case Development'' using university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning,
  and 4-layer scaffolding.


  **Topic Hierarchy (use exactly):** [''Cybersecurity'', ''Threat Intelligence And Hunting'', ''Threat Intelligence Frameworks'',
  ''008_Threat Intelligence Platforms and Tools'', ''SIEM Integration'', ''Threat Intelligence-Driven Use Case Development'']


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the exact array from ''learning_objectives'' above]. Ensure coverage.


  **Active Learning Integration:** Draw questions from discussion (e.g., misconceptions), peer teaching (e.g., TI types),
  problem-solving (e.g., phishing scenario).


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert exact details from ''scaffolding'' above]. Distribute flashcards: 10-15 per layer.


  **Content Completeness:** Cover four TI types fully (Strategic: high-level landscape/executives [MITRE]; Tactical: TTPs/SOC
  [SANS]; Operational: campaigns/hunters [Recorded Future]; Technical: IOCs/tools [BlueVoyant]). TI lifecycle, MITRE ATT&CK,
  step-by-step process, SIEM integration (Splunk/ELK), examples (Cobalt Strike), pitfalls (alert fatigue, IOC-only), misconceptions
  (TI ≠ IOCs). Prior knowledge: SIEM basics, IOCs.


  **Flashcard Schema:** Output JSON array of objects matching [Flashcard Schema structure above]. Mix types; balance Bloom''s
  (20% lower, 80% higher). For MCQs, always include 3 distractors per protocol.


  **Output Format:** Pure JSON array, no extra text. Each flashcard must reference hierarchy, layer, Bloom''s. Explanations:
  2-4 sentences, actionable, with sources (e.g., [RecordedFuture.com]). Ensure progressive complexity.'
