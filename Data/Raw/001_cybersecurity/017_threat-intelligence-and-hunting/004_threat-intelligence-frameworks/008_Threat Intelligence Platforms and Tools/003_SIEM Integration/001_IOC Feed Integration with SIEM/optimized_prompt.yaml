active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a resource-constrained environment, should organizations prioritize STIX/TAXII standardized feeds
    or custom IOC sources for SIEM integration? Debate pros, cons, and real-world trade-offs, considering factors like interoperability,
    speed, cost, and alignment with threat hunting maturity.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    protocol'' vs. TAXII), 2) Partial truths (e.g., outdated protocols), 3) Related but incorrect concepts (e.g., confuse
    with YARA rules). Ensure distractors are realistic from voter/research context.'

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''IOC Feed Integration with SIEM'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat
  Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Frameworks > 008_Threat Intelligence Platforms and Tools > SIEM Integration
  > IOC Feed Integration with SIEM).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Active Learning: Use concepts from discussion, peer teaching, and problem-solving for applied cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [insert full scaffolding above].

  - Prerequisites: Assume basic SIEM/IOC knowledge.
