active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains LOTL techniques with real-world examples (e.g., using PowerShell for persistence);
    the partner teaches back using a non-example (e.g., legitimate admin activity) and quizzes the first on detection methods.
  problem_solving: 'In groups, analyze a real-world breach scenario like SolarWinds: Use CTI from sources like CISA to hunt
    for indicators, hypothesize adversary TTPs (including LOTL), and propose countermeasures linking to threat hunting frameworks.'

  - **Learning Objectives** (span Bloom''s): [insert full list above].

  - **Active Learning** for context: [insert full active_learning above].

  - **Scaffolding** (4 layers): [insert full scaffolding above]. Prior knowledge: Link to basic threats/vulns.

  - **Content Completion**: Key Trends: RaaS, supply chain (SolarWinds), AI-powered attacks, cloud misconfigs, LOTL rise,
  enterprising adversaries (business-like). Sources: MITRE ATT&CK, NIST, CISA, CrowdStrike, BlueVoyant. Big Picture: Foundational
  for program skills/training.

  - Definitions: CTI (actionable threat info), Threat Hunting (proactive search), LOTL (native tool abuse), etc.
