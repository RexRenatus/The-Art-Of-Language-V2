        "core_logic": "Successful threat hunting procedures should be automated where possible and their findings shared because this maximizes the efficiency of the threat hunting team and improves the organization's overall detection capabilities, since repeatable processes can be integrated into broader security operations. This works by turning novel detection methods discovered during hunts into automated analytics or SIEM rules, providing continuous monitoring for those specific TTPs.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors suggest limiting knowledge sharing, discarding valuable procedures, or prematurely handing off without automation, failing to recognize the importance of leveraging successful hunts for efficiency and broader detection.",
        "analogy": "If you discover a clever way to disarm a specific type of trap (successful hunt), you document it, teach others (share), and maybe even build a machine to do it automatically (automate)."
