active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the critical role of an Intelligence Architect in bridging Threat Intelligence
    and Threat Hunting. Use real-world examples like mapping TTPs from MITRE ATT&CK to internal hunting hypotheses, and evaluate
    potential gaps if this role is absent in a SOC.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Plausible misconceptions: E.g., confuse IOCs with TTPs (IOCs are artifacts, TTPs are behaviors).'
    - 'Common errors: Mix frameworks (e.g., Cyber Kill Chain as detection-only vs. full lifecycle).'
    - 'Related but incorrect: E.g., for Architect role, distractors like ''only collects data'' vs. ''designs systems''.'
    - 'Balance: 3 distractors per MCQ, 1 very close (e.g., Diamond Model vs. ATT&CK for analysis).'
    quantity: 20-30% of cards as MCQs with distractors.

  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Frameworks > 009_Threat Intelligence
  Program Management > Team 003_Roles and Responsibilities > Intelligence Architect). Use this research context: [Insert full
  research context here, including definitions of TI, Hunting, Architect, IOCs/TTPs; frameworks: MITRE ATT&CK (TTPs), Diamond
  Model (analysis), Cyber Kill Chain, TI Lifecycle; platforms: MISP, ThreatConnect; roles: design pipelines, feedback loops.

  Incorporate these EXACT learning objectives: [paste learning_objectives array]. Scaffolding layers: [paste scaffolding_layers
  array]. Active learning: [reference activities for explanations].


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards following the flashcard_schema exactly. Balance: ~1/3 per Bloom''s category (Remember/Understand,
  Apply/Analyze, Evaluate/Create); 12-13 per layer. Use voter priorities: Complete frameworks, roles, pedagogy.


  Prioritize active recall, spaced repetition best practices. Ensure university-level rigor. Output ONLY a JSON array matching
  the schema''s output_format. No extra text.'
