active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the pros and cons of centralized vs. decentralized threat intelligence teams using NICE Framework
    roles. Consider factors like communication efficiency, response time to threats, and resource allocation in real-world
    scenarios (e.g., a financial institution vs. a government agency).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Threat Intelligence Frameworks.
  Topic: Organizational Structure and Roles Definition (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat
  Intelligence Frameworks > 009_Threat Intelligence Program Management > Program Development and Strategy > Organizational
  Structure and Roles Definition).


  Content Foundation: Use NICE Framework (niccs.cisa.gov): Categories (Analyze, Collect/Operate, Investigate, etc.); TI Roles
  (Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst: analyze threats/TTPs/IOCs; Threat Hunter: proactive hunts; All-Source Analyst, etc.).
  Include CTI (collect/analyze/disseminate intel), Threat Hunting, TTPs, IOCs. Structures: Centralized (flat, direct reporting)
  vs. Decentralized (team silos). Other frameworks: MITRE ATT&CK (TTP mapping), SANS. Real examples: Enterprise TI teams with
  Manager > Analysts > Hunters.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list from above]

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to activities (e.g., MCQs for debate prep).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers [Insert full layers from above].

  - Concept Map: Central ''Org Structure & Roles'' → ''NICE Categories'' → ''TI Roles'' → deps ''TTPs/IOCs''.


  Generate 25 flashcards following this exact schema [Insert full flashcard_schema from above]. Output as JSON array of objects,
  each with ''type'', ''layer'', ''blooms_level'', ''front''/''question'', ''back''/''options''/''explanation''. Ensure high-quality,
  accurate, engaging content with sources (e.g., NICE, MITRE, LinkedIn guides).'
