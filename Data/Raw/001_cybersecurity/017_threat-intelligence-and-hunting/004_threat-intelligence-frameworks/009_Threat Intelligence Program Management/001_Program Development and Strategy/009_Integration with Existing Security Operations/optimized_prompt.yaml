active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: Divide the class into teams, each assigned a key framework (e.g., NIST CSF, MITRE ATT&CK). Teams prepare
    a 5-minute teach-back on its core components, integration benefits for SOCs, and one practical example. Peers take notes,
    ask questions, and rate clarity on a rubric (e.g., accuracy, relevance to TI integration).
  problem_solving: 'In teams, develop an integration roadmap for a hypothetical mid-sized enterprise SOC to incorporate threat
    hunting using NIST CSF and MITRE ATT&CK. Include: current state assessment, tools (e.g., SIEM like Splunk, SOAR like Splunk
    Phantom), timelines (phased over 6-12 months), training plans, and KPIs (e.g., reduced MTTD by 30%). Present roadmaps
    to the class for feedback and iteration.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on
  the topic ''Integration with Existing 012_Security Operations'' (Category: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting
  > Threat Intelligence Frameworks > 009_Threat Intelligence Program Management > Program Development and Strategy > Integration
  with Existing 012_Security Operations).


  Incorporate this research context: CTI (actionable insights on threats/IOCs/TTPs); Threat Hunting (proactive search); TI-Driven
  SOC (proactive via real-time CTI); IOCs (IPs/hashes/domains). NIST CSF: Govern/Identify (risk mgmt)/Protect/Detect (anomalies)/Respond/Recover.
  MITRE ATT&CK: Tactics (e.g., Recon, Execution), Techniques/Procedures matrix. Integration shifts SOC from reactive to predictive;
  challenges: silos, skills; tools: SIEM (Splunk), SOAR (Phantom), EDR. Examples: SolarWinds (ATT&CK mapping).
