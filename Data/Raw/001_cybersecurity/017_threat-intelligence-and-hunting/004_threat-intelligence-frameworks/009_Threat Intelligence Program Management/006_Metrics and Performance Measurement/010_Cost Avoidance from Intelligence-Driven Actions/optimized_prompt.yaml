  - Learning objectives: [PASTE learning_objectives array here]

  - Active learning: [PASTE active_learning_components array here]

  - Scaffolding: [PASTE scaffolding_layers array here]

  - Voter priorities: Emphasize completeness (FAIR formulas: ALE=LEF×LM; Cost Avoidance=ALE_pre-ALE_post; examples: ransomware
  $1.5M avoided, DBIR $4.45M avg breach); best practices (measurable metrics: prevented incidents, response time reductions).

  - Research: CTI defs from arXiv:2507.17628v1; FAIR for ROI; NIST; MITRE ATT&CK; Verizon DBIR.


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema: JSON array of objects with ''front'', ''back'' (answer, explanation,
  distractors), ''metadata'' (bloom_level, scaffolding_layer, tags). Ensure 70% MCQ with 3 distractors per protocol. Cover
  all objectives/layers evenly. Promote active recall, spaced repetition best practices. Use real examples (e.g., ALE calcs).
  Output ONLY the JSON array.'
