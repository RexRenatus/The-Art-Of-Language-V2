active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges of quantifying 'avoided losses' in ROI calculations for
    proactive threat hunting programs. Provide examples from real-world breaches (e.g., Equifax) and propose solutions for
    hybrid metrics to address stakeholder skepticism.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Threat Intelligence. Topic:\
  \ Return on Investment (ROI) Calculation (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence\

  \ Calculation).\n\nGenerate 50 high-quality Anki-style flashcards optimized for spaced repetition, covering all Bloom's\
  \ levels and scaffolding layers. Incorporate voter consensus: Focus on ROI formulas (e.g., ROI = ((Net Benefits - Costs)/Costs)×100),\
  \ cybersecurity examples (avoided breaches, personnel costs), hybrid metrics, CTI levels (strategic/operational/tactical),\
  \ and threat hunting.\n\n**Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list from above].\n**Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full descriptions\
