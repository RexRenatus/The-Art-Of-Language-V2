active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, explain PoC vs. PoV using a cybersecurity tool example (e.g., SIEM for threat hunting), then quiz
    your partner on key differences, success metrics, and common misconceptions like treating PoC as a sales demo.
  problem_solving: Given a threat actor's TTPs (e.g., APT29 from MITRE ATT&CK), design a PoC test for a SIEM tool, including
    hypothesis, data collection, success metrics, risks, and procurement recommendations. Simulate group presentations to
    'stakeholders' and role-play threat hunting scenarios using IoCs/IoAs.

    2) Partial truth (e.g., correct step but wrong framework), 3) Extreme/opposite (e.g., ignore risks). Base on voter-noted
    pitfalls like PoC=PoV or truncated frameworks.'

  **Completed Research Context (Voter-Approved Completeness):** PoC is a small-scale experiment validating tech feasibility
  against threats (moxso.com). Integrates with Threat Intelligence (threat actor data/TTPs) and Hunting (proactive searches).
  Bitsight''s 5-Step Framework: 1. Hypothesis (from intel), 2. Collect data, 3. Profile data, 4. Hunt (using IoCs/IoAs), 5.
  Respond. Key: MITRE ATT&CK for TTPs. Concept Map: PoC (center) connects upstream to Hypothesis/TTPs/IoCs/IoAs (hunting frameworks)
  and downstream to Procurement (tech selection). Pitfalls: Scope creep, confusing PoC/PoV. Sources: Bitsight Guide to Cyber
  Threat Hunting (https://www.bitsight.com/learn/cti/guide-to-cyber-threat-hunting), Moxso PoC Glossary (https://moxso.com/blog/glossary/proof-of-concept-poc),
  MITRE ATT&CK (https://attack.mitre.org).
