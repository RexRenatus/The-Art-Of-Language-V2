active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, prioritize three persistence techniques from MITRE ATT&CK (e.g., Scheduled Tasks,
    BITS Jobs, Account Manipulation) by eradication difficulty. Justify your ranking based on real-world challenges like indicator
    removal and adversary countermeasures, and debate how threat intelligence can optimize prioritization.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate research context: Persistence (TA0003) maintains access; Eradication removes it fully. Key techniques: T1053
  Scheduled Task/Job, T1197 BITS Jobs, T1547 Boot/Logon Autostart, T1098 Account Manipulation, T1136 Create Account, T1546
  Event Triggered, T1133 External Remote Services, T1574 Hijack Execution Flow. Procedures: Isolate, Inventory, Remove, Hunt,
  Validate. Sources: MITRE ATT&CK (https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003/), CISA IR Guidance (https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/IR).


  Pedagogy: Align to Bloom''s (Remember/Understand: Layers 1; Apply/Analyze: 2-3; Evaluate/Create: 3-4). Scaffolding: Layer1
  Foundation (definitions, prior: NIST IR, ATT&CK intro); Layer2 Components (ATT&CK techniques); Layer3 Implementation (eradication
  steps); Layer4 Integration (IR/threat hunting links). Active learning: Embed hints for discussion/peer teach/problem-solving.
