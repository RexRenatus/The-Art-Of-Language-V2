active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between signature-based filtering rules (e.g., exact IoC
    matches) and behavior-based rules informed by threat intelligence TTPs. Consider false positives, evasion techniques,
    and scalability in enterprise environments. Support arguments with examples from NIST CSF or real-world breaches.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    term (e.g., ''spam filter'' vs. ''phishing rule''), 2) related but incorrect framework (e.g., ''NIST CSF Identify'' vs.
    ''Protect''), 3) partial truth (e.g., ''IP-based only'' vs. ''domain + IP reputation''). Ensure distractors are web-research
    grounded and promote critical analysis.'
