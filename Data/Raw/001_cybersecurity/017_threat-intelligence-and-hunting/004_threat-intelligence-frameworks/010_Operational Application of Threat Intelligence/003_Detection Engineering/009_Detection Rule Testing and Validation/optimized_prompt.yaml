active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss how inadequate testing and validation of detection rules contributes to alert fatigue in Security
    Operations Centers (SOCs). Propose strategies using NIST CSF Detect function and threat intelligence to mitigate false
    positives while minimizing false negatives.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - D1: Common misconception (e.g., confuse FP with FN).

    - D2: Related but incorrect concept (e.g., mix NIST CSF with Respond function).

    - D3: Edge case or partial truth (e.g., valid metric but wrong formula).

    Ensure distractors test nuance, not trivia.'

  **Context (Completed Research Summary):** Detection rules identify threats; testing verifies under scenarios, validation
  ensures objectives met (min FP/FN). Use threat intel for tests. NIST CSF Detect: DE.CM-1 (anomalies), DE.AE-1 (events)—testing
  aligns rules here. MITRE ATT&CK for TTP tests; Sigma for SIEM rules; Metrics: Precision/Recall. Steps: Scenarios, simulate,
  measure, tune. Integrate: Hunting, SOAR, ML. Sources: [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org), [NIST CSF](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework),

  **Active Learning:** Use for inspiration (e.g., flashcards simulating discussions/problems).


  **Task:** Generate 24 high-quality flashcards following the exact schema. Balance: 6 per layer, progressive Bloom''s. Output
  as numbered JSON array. Ensure university-level: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, distractors per protocol. No
  duplicates; ground in context/sources.'
