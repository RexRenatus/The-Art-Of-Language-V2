  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Detection Coverage Gap Analysis using MITRE ATT&CK is
    more effective than traditional vulnerability scanning for improving security posture.'' Support your position with examples
    from real-world breaches (e.g., SolarWinds) and address common misconceptions like confusing TTP mapping with IOC hunting.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Research Context (Complete Summary):** Detection Coverage Gap Analysis identifies deficiencies in detecting threats by
  comparing security controls against adversary TTPs. Key concepts: Detection Coverage (extent of threat identification),
  Gap (blind spots), TI (threat info), Threat Hunting (proactive search), TTPs (MITRE ATT&CK). Frameworks: MITRE ATT&CK (Enterprise/Mobile/ICS
  matrices for TTPs); CTI Lifecycle (1. Planning/Direction, 2. Collection, 3. Processing/Exploitation, 4. Analysis/Production,
  5. Dissemination, 6. Feedback). Process: Inventory detections → Map to ATT&CK → Identify/prioritize gaps → Recommend fixes.
  Integration: SIEM automation, hunting pipelines. Sources: MITRE ATT&CK (https://attack.mitre.org/), ATT&CK Navigator (https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/),
  SANS CTI Lifecycle (https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/threat/intelligence-35282).
