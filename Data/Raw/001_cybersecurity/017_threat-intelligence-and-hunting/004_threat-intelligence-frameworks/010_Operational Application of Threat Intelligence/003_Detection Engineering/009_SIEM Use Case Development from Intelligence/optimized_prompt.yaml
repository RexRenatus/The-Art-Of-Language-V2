active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages and limitations of IOC-based versus TTP-based SIEM use cases
    when developing detections from threat intelligence. Use examples from MITRE ATT&CK to support your arguments and consider
    real-world scenarios like ransomware campaigns.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    IOCs with TTPs); 2) Similar terms (e.g., SIEM vs SOAR); 3) Partial truths (e.g., valid for one ATT&CK tactic but not another);
    4) Real-world pitfalls (e.g., high false-positive rules). Ensure one correct answer, distractors plausible per voter consensus
    and research.'
