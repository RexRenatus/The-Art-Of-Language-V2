  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''CVSS scores alone are sufficient for patch prioritization
    in most organizations.'' Use evidence from EPSS data, CISA KEV, and real-world exploits like Log4Shell to support your
    position, considering organizational context such as industry and threat actors.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors that are plausible errors: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''CVSS v4 is always
    exploit-predictive'' – false). 2) Partial truth (e.g., high CVSS but low EPSS). 3) Extreme/outlier (e.g., ignore threat
    intel entirely). Ensure distractors teach by contrast, referencing real sources like EPSS model limitations.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Patch Prioritization
  Based on Threat Context'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Intelligence Frameworks
  > 010_Operational Application of Threat Intelligence > 011_Vulnerability Management Integration > Patch Prioritization Based
  on Threat Context). Use the provided research context, voter suggestions (complete adversary focus with APTs/ransomware,
  Log4Shell examples, EPSS/CISA KEV sources), prior knowledge (CVSS basics), and pedagogical structure to generate high-quality
  Anki-style flashcards.


  **Research Context Summary:** Traditional CVSS has limitations (poor real-world exploit correlation; sources: csiac.dtic.mil).
  Shift to threat-centric: Use EPSS (first.org/epss, predicts exploit probability), CISA KEV (cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog),
  CTI for adversary TTPs (e.g., APTs like APT29, ransomware like LockBit). Key process: Collect intel > Map to assets > Score
  (EPSS/KEV adjust CVSS) > Prioritize. Examples: Log4Shell (rapid prioritization due to mass exploitation).


  **Incorporate:**

  - Learning Objectives: [insert the 6 objectives above].

  - Scaffolding: [insert the 4 layers above].

  - Active Learning: Inspire flashcards that prep for discussions/exercises (e.g., scenario Qs for problem-solving).


  **Output Format:** JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"front": "...", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "..."},
  "distractors": ["opt1", "opt2", "opt3"], "metadata": {"bloom_level": "...", "layer": 1, "difficulty": "Medium"}}. For non-MCQ,
  distractors optional. Ensure active recall, spaced repetition best practices. No fluff; precise, educational.'
