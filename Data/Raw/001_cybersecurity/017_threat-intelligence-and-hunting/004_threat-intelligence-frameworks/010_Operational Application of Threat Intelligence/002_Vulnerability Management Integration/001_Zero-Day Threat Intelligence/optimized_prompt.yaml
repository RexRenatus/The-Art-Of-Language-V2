active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical and practical trade-offs of sharing zero-day threat intelligence
    via standards like STIX/TAXII before vendor patches are available. Use real-world examples like the SolarWinds Orion supply
    chain attack to support arguments on risks vs. benefits for collective defense.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Core Content:

  - Definitions: Zero-day vulnerability (unknown to vendor/public), exploit (attack method), threat intel (early warnings).

  - Frameworks: MITRE ATT&CK (map tactics), STIX (structured CTI), TAXII (sharing), NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

  - Best Practices: Proactive monitoring paramount, integrate threat hunting/vuln mgmt, automate intel feeds, tabletop exercises.

  - Examples: SolarWinds Orion supply chain zero-day.

  - Sources: CISA MITRE ATT&CK Best Practices (https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/Best%20Practices%20for%20MITRE%20ATTCK%20Mapping.pdf),
  OASIS STIX 2.1 (https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro.html), NIST SP 800-61 (2022).


  Learning Objectives (Bloom''s): [Insert the learning_objectives array here].

  Scaffolding Layers: [Insert the scaffolding array here].

  Active Learning Integration: Ensure cards support discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving by including scenario-based questions.


  Generate exactly 25 flashcards following the schema:

  [Insert flashcard_schema.structure here]


  Rules:

  - Balance: 4-5 per Bloom''s level, 6 per scaffolding layer.

  - Distractors: ALWAYS exactly 3, plausible (e.g., mix up STIX/TAXII), with explanations debunking misconceptions.

  - Pedagogy: Use active recall, spaced repetition-friendly (concise Q/A, rich explanations).

  - Accuracy: Ground in provided content/sources; no fabrication.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcard objects. No additional text.'
