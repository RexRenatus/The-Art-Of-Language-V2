active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: When integrating threat intelligence into vulnerability management, under what conditions should compensating
    controls be prioritized over immediate patching? Debate using a recent breach case (e.g., Log4j) and NIST CSF functions
    (e.g., Detect and Respond). Consider factors like CVSS/EPSS scores and operational constraints.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Plausible misconceptions (e.g., 'Compensating controls replace primary ones' vs. 'offset risks').
    - Partial truths (e.g., 'Use patching' as distractor for unpatchable scenario).
    - Opposites/extremes (e.g., 'Ignore vulnerability' vs. 'Proactive hunting').
    - Common errors from frameworks (e.g., misalign NIST functions).
    - Generate 3 per MCQ, ensure 1-2 are highly plausible to promote active recall.

  Incorporate these exactly:

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE THE learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [PASTE THE scaffolding_layers OBJECT HERE]

  - Active Learning: Use elements to inspire scenario cards.

  - Research: NIST CSF 2.0 (Govern/Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover), PCI-DSS compensating controls, examples (Log4j
  breach, Windows XP legacy, threat hunting for unpatched vulns, CVSS/EPSS).


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards following the schema:

  Ensure progressive coverage: Start with Layer 1/Remember, build to Layer 4/Create. Make MCQs challenging with distractors.
  Explanations must be educational, tying to pedagogy (e.g., ''This tests Apply level by simulating vuln mgmt'').
