active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In groups of 4-5, debate the pros and cons of relying primarily on IoCs versus TTPs for active exploitation
    monitoring. Reference the Pyramid of Pain and recent breaches (e.g., Log4Shell exploitation). Synthesize group insights
    into a shared class mind map, identifying when to pivot from one to the other.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Core Content (expanded from research): Active Exploitation Indicator Monitoring is the continuous process of detecting ongoing
  attacks via IoCs (e.g., IPs, hashes; RFC 9424: observable artifacts) and TTPs (adversary behaviors; MITRE ATT&CK: 14 tactics
  like Reconnaissance TA0043, techniques like T1190 Exploit Public-Facing App). Pyramid of Pain: IoCs low-effort for attackers,
  TTPs high. Implementation: SIEM (Splunk/ELK) + ATT&CK mapping, Sigma rules, threat hunting loops. Integration: Vuln mgmt
  (CVEs + EPSS), ML anomalies, proactive hunts. Sources: https://attack.mitre.org/, https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9424,
  SANS Threat Hunting.
