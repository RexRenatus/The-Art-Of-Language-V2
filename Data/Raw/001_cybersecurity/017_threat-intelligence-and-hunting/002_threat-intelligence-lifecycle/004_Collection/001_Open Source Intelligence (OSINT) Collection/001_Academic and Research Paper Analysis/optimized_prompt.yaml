active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast the role of OSINT in the threat intelligence lifecycle as described in two selected
    academic papers (e.g., one on passive OSINT sources and one integrating active collection with TTPs). Debate strengths,
    limitations, real-world applicability, and address misconceptions like OSINT being solely passive surveillance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    elements); 2. Partial truth/mix-up (e.g., confuse IoCs with TTPs); 3. Irrelevant/outdated concept (e.g., legacy framework
    vs. MITRE). Ensure distractors are plausible based on research context and voter-noted misconceptions.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Threat Intelligence and
  Hunting. Generate 25 high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards on the topic ''Academic and Research Paper Analysis'' in the
  context of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) 003_Collection within the Threat Intelligence Lifecycle.

  **Research Context:** CTI is proactive collection/processing/analysis of threat data into actionable intel. Threat Hunting:
  Hypothesis-driven search for undetected threats using IoCs/TTPs. Key terms: IoCs (e.g., IPs, hashes), TTPs (adversary behaviors),
  APTs (targeted attacks), OSINT (public sources). MITRE ATT&CK: Globally-accessible knowledge base of TTPs from real-world
  attacks, with matrices (Enterprise, ICS) covering Tactics (e.g., Reconnaissance), Techniques (e.g., Phishing T1566), Procedures,
  Mitigations. Real-world: SolarWinds APT used supply chain compromise (T1195.001).

  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives from above].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers from above].


  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Incorporate prompts referencing discussion (compare papers), peer teaching (explain sections),
  problem-solving (SolarWinds analysis).


  **Flashcard Generation Instructions:**

  - Follow exact schema: {''front'':..., ''back'':..., ''explanation'':..., ''bloom_level'':..., ''type'':..., ''distractors'':[...]}.

  - Ensure university pedagogy: Scaffolded progression, active recall, spaced repetition friendly.

  - Cover voter priorities: TTPs/IoCs extraction, MITRE validation, misconceptions, completeness.

  - Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcards, e.g., [card1, card2,...]. No extra text.'
