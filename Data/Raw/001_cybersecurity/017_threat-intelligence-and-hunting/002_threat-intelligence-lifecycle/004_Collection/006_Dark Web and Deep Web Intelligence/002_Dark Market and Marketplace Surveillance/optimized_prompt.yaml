  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving where relevant.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute across 4 layers [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM ABOVE].

  - Research Context: Dark markets (Tor-hidden, trade stolen data/malware); Tools (Flashpoint, Recorded Future, Memex, Tor
  crawlers); TI role (proactive IOCs); MITRE ATT&CK mapping (e.g., stolen creds to Initial Access); Ethics/Legal (CFAA compliance);
  Sources (kelacyber.com, crowdstrike.com, ingecom.net).

  - Prior Knowledge: Tor, onion routing, Deep/Dark Web distinctions.


  Use EXACTLY the flashcard schema [INSERT FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE], with snake_case fields, precisely 3 distractors per card
  (follow protocol), and balanced coverage (4-5 per Bloom''s level, 6-7 per layer). Questions must be active/measurable (e.g.,
  ''List 3 tools for...''). Ensure completeness: Cover truncated areas like full MITRE ATT&CK ties and sources.


  Knowledge Checks: Include 5 cards as formative assessments (e.g., ''Evaluate this strategy...'').


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcards, no additional text.'
