      "correct_answer": "They provide Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), meaning that the compromise of a server's long-term private key does not allow decryption of past sessions.",

        {
          "text": "They eliminate the need for SSL/TLS certificates altogether.",
          "misconception": "Targets [misunderstanding of role]: Ephemeral key exchange methods are used during the TLS handshake to establish session keys; certificates are still required for authentication."

          "text": "They significantly speed up the TLS handshake process.",

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Ephemeral key exchange methods like DHE and ECDHE generate unique, temporary key pairs for each session. This provides Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) because even if the server's long-term private key is compromised later, past session keys cannot be derived from it. Therefore, past communications remain secure, significantly enhancing overall security posture.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly claim ephemeral methods eliminate certificates, drastically speed up handshakes, or enforce AES usage, missing the core security benefit of Perfect Forward Secrecy.",
        "analogy": "Using ephemeral keys is like using a unique, disposable code word for each secret conversation. Even if someone learns today's code word, they can't use it to decipher yesterday's conversations."
