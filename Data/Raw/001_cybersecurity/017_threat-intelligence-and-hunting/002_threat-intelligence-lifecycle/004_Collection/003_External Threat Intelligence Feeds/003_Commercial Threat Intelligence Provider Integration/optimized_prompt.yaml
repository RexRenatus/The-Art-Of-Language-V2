active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a resource-constrained organization, debate whether integrating a commercial threat intelligence provider
    like those supporting STIX/TAXII (e.g., into Microsoft Sentinel) is worth the cost compared to free open-source feeds.
    Consider factors like data freshness, coverage, integration ease, and false positives.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    STIX with TAXII roles; mix up SIEM vs SOAR; use real but incorrect providers like ''VirusTotal'' for commercial CTI).
    Ensure 1 correct answer. Distractors from research context or voter suggestions (e.g., ''open-source only supports STIX'').'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Commercial Threat Intelligence
  Provider Integration'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > 003_Threat Intelligence Lifecycle
  > 003_Collection > External Threat Intelligence Feeds > Commercial Threat Intelligence Provider Integration). Use university-style
  pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy progression (Remember/Understand → Apply/Analyze → Evaluate/Create), active learning (discussion,
  peer teaching, problem-solving), and 4-layer scaffolding (Foundation → Components → Implementation → Integration).


  Core Content (from research/voter consensus): CTI/TI definitions, IOCs, TIP/SIEM/SOAR, incident enrichment, STIX (Structured
  Threat Information eXpression: standard for expressing threat data), TAXII (Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information:
  sharing protocol), Microsoft Sentinel integration (connectors, API keys, workflows). Commercial providers offer fresh/covered
  data vs open-source trade-offs. Sources: Microsoft Sentinel Docs (https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/), OASIS STIX/TAXII
  (https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/).
