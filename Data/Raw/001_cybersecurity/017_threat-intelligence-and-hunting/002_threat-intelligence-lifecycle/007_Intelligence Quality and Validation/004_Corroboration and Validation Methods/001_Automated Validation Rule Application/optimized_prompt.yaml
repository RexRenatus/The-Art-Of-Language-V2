active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether automated validation rules can fully replace human analysts in validating
    threat hypotheses based on MITRE ATT&CK TTPs, using real-world examples of automation failures (e.g., false positives
    in Sigma rules during high-volume alerts).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Threat Intelligence and
  Hunting. Generate 50 high-quality Anki-style flashcards for the topic ''Automated Validation Rule Application'' (Topic Hierarchy:

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives: [insert learning_objectives array here]

  - Active learning tie-ins: Reference discussion debates, peer teaching examples, and problem-solving scenarios in explanations.

  - 4-Layer Scaffolding: Layer 1 (Foundation: basic terms); Layer 2 (Components: frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK, Cyber Kill
  Chain); Layer 3 (Implementation: steps, Sigma rules in SIEM/SOAR); Layer 4 (Integration: ML, lifecycle).

  - Research context: Automated validation uses rules engines to verify IOCs/IOAs/TTPs in TI lifecycle. Cyber Kill Chain (Lockheed
  Martin): Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, C2, Actions. Examples: Sigma rules in Splunk/ELK,
  SOAR (Phantom/XSOAR). Sources: MITRE ATT&CK (https://attack.mitre.org/), Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain (https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html),
  SigmaHQ (https://sigmahq.io/).

  Output ONLY a JSON array of 50 flashcards: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''references'': [''...'']}}, ...]. Balance types across Bloom''s levels (10 per lower 2 levels, 15 mid, 15 upper). Ensure
  active recall, spaced repetition optimization (concise fronts, detailed backs). Use real-world examples (e.g., IP IOC validation).'
