      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "A cost-benefit analysis for detection thresholds aims to find the optimal balance between detecting most real threats (minimizing false negatives) and avoiding an overwhelming number of false positive alerts that burden security analysts. This balance ensures efficient resource allocation and effective risk management.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The first distractor proposes an impossible goal. The second suggests maximizing alerts, which is counterproductive. The third focuses on platform costs, which are not the primary concern of threshold analysis.",
        "analogy": "It's like adjusting the sensitivity of a motion detector for a security system: you want it sensitive enough to catch intruders (real threats) but not so sensitive that it triggers for passing cars or blowing leaves (false alarms), which wastes security's time."
