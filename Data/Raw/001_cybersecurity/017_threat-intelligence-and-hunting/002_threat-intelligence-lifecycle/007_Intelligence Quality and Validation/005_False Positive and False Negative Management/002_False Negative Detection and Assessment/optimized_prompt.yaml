active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of relying on IoC-based detection (bottom of Pyramid of
    Pain) versus TTP-based detection (top of Pyramid of Pain) for minimizing false negatives. Provide real-world examples
    from breaches where FNs occurred due to fragile IoCs, and propose hybrid strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
