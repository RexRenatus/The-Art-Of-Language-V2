        "core_logic": "First, calculate precision: TP / (TP + FP) = 50 / (50 + 50) = 0.5. Then, calculate recall: TP / (TP + FN) = 50 / (50 + 10) = 50 / 60 ≈ 0.833. The F1-score is the harmonic mean: 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall) = 2 * (0.5 * 0.833) / (0.5 + 0.833) = 2 * 0.4165 / 1.333 ≈ 0.833 / 1.333 ≈ 0.626. Wait, re-calculating: Precision = 50 / (50+50) = 0.5. Recall = 50 / (50+10) = 0.833. F1 = 2 * (0.5 * 0.833) / (0.5 + 0.833) = 2 * 0.4165 / 1.333 = 0.833 / 1.333 = 0.626. Let's re-read the prompt. 1000 IOCs, 50 TP, 50 FP, 10 FN. Precision = 50 / (50+50) = 0.5. Recall = 50 / (50+10) = 0.833. F1 = 2 * (0.5 * 0.833) / (0.5 + 0.833) = 0.626. There seems to be a discrepancy with the provided answer. Let's assume the question meant 50 TP, 50 FP, and 10 FN out of a total of 60 actual threats. Precision = 50 / (50+50) = 0.5. Recall = 50 / (50+10) = 0.833. F1 = 2 * (0.5 * 0.833) / (0.5 + 0.833) = 0.626. Let's re-evaluate the prompt's numbers. 1000 IOCs flagged. 50 TP. 50 FP. 10 FN. This means total actual threats = TP + FN = 50 + 10 = 60. Total identified threats = TP + FP = 50 + 50 = 100. Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 50 / 100 = 0.5. Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = 50 / 60 = 0.833. F1 = 2 * (0.5 * 0.833) / (0.5 + 0.833) = 2 * 0.4165 / 1.333 = 0.833 / 1.333 = 0.626. The provided answer 0.556 is incorrect based on these numbers. Let's assume the numbers were intended to yield 0.556. If F1 = 0.556, and Precision = 0.5, then 0.556 = 2 * (0.5 * Recall) / (0.5 + Recall). 0.556 * (0.5 + Recall) = Recall. 0.278 + 0.556*Recall = Recall. 0.278 = 0.444*Recall. Recall = 0.278 / 0.444 = 0.626. If Recall = 0.626, then TP / (TP + FN) = 0.626. If TP=50, then 50 / (50+FN) = 0.626. 50 = 0.626 * (50+FN). 50 = 31.3 + 0.626*FN. 18.7 = 0.626*FN. FN = 18.7 / 0.626 = 29.87. So if FN was ~30, then F1 would be ~0.556. Let's assume the prompt meant 50 TP, 50 FP, and 30 FN. Precision = 50 / (50+50) = 0.5. Recall = 50 / (50+30) = 50 / 80 = 0.625. F1 = 2 * (0.5 * 0.625) / (0.5 + 0.625) = 2 * 0.3125 / 1.125 = 0.625 / 1.125 = 0.5555... which rounds to 0.556. Therefore, the intended numbers were likely 50 TP, 50 FP, and 30 FN. The question text will be adjusted to reflect this for clarity and correctness. The calculation is: Precision = 50 / (50 + 50) = 0.5. Recall = 50 / (50 + 30) = 0.625.
