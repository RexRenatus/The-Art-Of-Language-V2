active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a rapidly evolving threat landscape, debate the trade-offs between frequent intelligence refreshes
    (e.g., daily IOC updates from CISA alerts) and resource constraints. Using MITRE ATT&CK examples, argue for optimal cadences
    in tactical vs. strategic CTI and address the misconception that all intelligence expires uniformly.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Base on common misconceptions (e.g., 'All intel refreshes daily' vs. type-specific cadences).
    - Use similar terms (e.g., IOC vs. IOA).
    - Incorporate partial truths (e.g., 'Refresh TTPs daily' when it's weekly).
    - Draw from real frameworks (e.g., wrong CISA interval).
    - Ensure plausibility for active recall testing.

  6: Intelligence Refresh and Update Policies.


  **Research Context (Complete):** Effective threat intelligence relies on refresh/update policies for current data. Core
  concepts: CTI (strategic/operational/tactical), Threat Hunting (proactive search), Refresh (update existing intel), Update
  (add new intel), IOCs (forensic, 30-90 days/daily refresh), IOAs (real-time), TTPs (behaviors, weekly/ongoing). Frameworks:
  MITRE ATT&CK (TTP knowledge base), CISA (alerts), NCTC/CTIIC (Gov intel integration for validated sharing). Examples: Policy
  - IOCs daily via CISA, TTPs weekly MITRE. Aging criteria: confidence decay, actor changes. Sources: MITRE ATT&CK docs, CISA
  AIS, NIST SP 800-150, CTIIC reports.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives from above].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Weave in elements like discussion trade-offs, peer quizzing scenarios, problem-solving
  (e.g., outdated TTPs) into scenario-based cards.


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers from above]. Prior knowledge: Link to CTI basics/lifecycle.


  **Output Format:** JSON array of objects, each: {''front'': ''Question'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'', ''opt3''] (if MCQ), ''tags'': [''remember'', ''layer1'', ''IOCs'', ''level6'']}}.
  Strictly follow flashcard_schema. Balance coverage, address misconceptions. Voter-approved: 84.3% consensus on completeness/pedagogy.'
