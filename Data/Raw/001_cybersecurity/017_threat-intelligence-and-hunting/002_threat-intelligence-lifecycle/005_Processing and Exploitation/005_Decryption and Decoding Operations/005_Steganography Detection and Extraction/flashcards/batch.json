        "core_logic": "Red teaming involves structured testing, often simulating adversarial behavior, to uncover weaknesses and vulnerabilities in AI systems before they can be exploited. This proactive approach helps developers improve security and mitigate risks, such as the generation of harmful synthetic content.",
