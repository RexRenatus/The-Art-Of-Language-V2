Because precise temporal understanding is fundamental to effective threat analysis, inconsistent time zone data poses a significant risk to the validity of the intelligence. Therefore, it directly impacts analytical accuracy.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The primary risk is analytical inaccuracy due to ambiguity, not data corruption. It's an analytical problem, not an IDS trigger. While tools can help, the core issue is data ambiguity, not tool dependency.",
        "analogy": "Inconsistent timezone data is like having a meeting agenda where some times are listed in EST, some in PST, and some with no timezone specified – it makes it impossible to know when to actually attend each meeting."
