active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between high detection rates using IoC-based tools (fast
    but brittle) versus TTP-based hunting (slower but more effective). Use examples from MITRE ATT&CK to support your arguments
    and propose hybrid strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors by: 1) Swapping similar metrics (e.g., FPR as TPR). 2) Using outdated IoC focus
    vs TTPs. 3) Altering formulas slightly (e.g., Total Detected / False Positives). 4) Misapplying frameworks (e.g., NIST
    metrics to ATT&CK). Ensure 70% plausibility from real-world errors.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate high-quality Anki-style flashcards
  for the topic ''Threat Detection Rate and Effectiveness'' (Category: Cybersecurity, Domain: Threat Intelligence And Hunting,
  Subdomain: 003_Threat Intelligence Lifecycle, Entry: 007_Feedback and Evaluation, Performance Metrics and KPIs). Use the
  provided learning objectives, active learning activities, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema exactly.


  **Topic Content (Web-Grounded Research):** Threat detection identifies malicious activities. Key metrics: Detection Rate
  = (Detected Threats / Total Threats) * 100%; Effectiveness: TPR = TP/(TP+FN), Precision = TP/(TP+FP), Recall = TP/(TP+FN),
  FPR = FP/(FP+TN), MTTD (avg detection time), ATT&CK coverage %. IoCs (brittle artifacts) vs TTPs (behavioral: Tactics/Techniques/Procedures).
  Frameworks: MITRE ATT&CK (technique coverage), NIST CSF (Detect: metrics like MTTD). Threat Hunting: Proactive beyond signatures.
  Prerequisites: TI Lifecycle stages.


  **Concept Map:** Central: Threat Detection Rate & Effectiveness → Metrics (TPR/FPR/MTTD) → Frameworks (ATT&CK/NIST) → TI
  Lifecycle/Hunting → Links: TTPs improve rate over IoCs.


  Incorporate pedagogy: Objectives span Bloom''s (use provided list). Embed active learning (e.g., explain calc for problem-solving).
  Scaffolding: Distribute cards across layers.


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of 25 flashcards, each matching schema: {''front'': str, ''back'': {''correct_answer'': str,
  ''distractors'': [str,str,str], ''explanation'': str, ''bloom_level'': str, ''references'': str}, ''scaffolding_layer'':
  int (1-4)}. Ensure distractors follow protocol. Make explanations educational, tying to real-world cybersecurity.'
