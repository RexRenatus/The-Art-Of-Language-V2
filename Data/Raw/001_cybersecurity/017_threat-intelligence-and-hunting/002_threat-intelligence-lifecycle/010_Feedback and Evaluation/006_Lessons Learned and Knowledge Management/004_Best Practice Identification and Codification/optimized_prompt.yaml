active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one partner explains a phase of the CTI lifecycle (e.g., Feedback and Evaluation) and its link
    to best practice identification; switch roles, then co-create a one-page summary of a codified best practice for knowledge
    management.
  problem_solving: 'Analyze the Log4j vulnerability breach case: Extract key lessons learned from the CTI feedback phase,
    identify 3-5 best practices (e.g., proactive hunting with MITRE ATT&CK), and codify them into a runbook or knowledge base
    entry, justifying choices against NIST CSF Recover function.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Threat Intelligence and
  Hunting. Generate 25 high-quality flashcards for the topic: **Best Practice Identification and Codification** (Category:
  Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > 003_Threat Intelligence Lifecycle > 007_Feedback and Evaluation > Lessons
  Learned and Knowledge Management > Best Practice Identification and Codification).


  **Context and Completeness:** Base content on full CTI Lifecycle (Planning & Direction, Collection, Processing & Exploitation,
  Analysis & Production, Dissemination, Feedback). Complete truncated elements: Collection Management Framework (CMF) is a
  structured process for prioritizing collection sources (OSINT, closed sources, technical feeds) to align with intel requirements,
  feeding into best practice codification via lessons from feedback. Sources: MITRE ATT&CK (adversary TTPs), NIST CSF (functions:
  Identify-Protect-Detect-Respond-Recover with feedback), CTI models (e.g., SANS, DIAM), knowledge bases like runbooks/wikis.


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the 6 objectives above]. Ensure cards progress Bloom''s: 30% Remember/Understand, 40% Apply/Analyze,
  30% Evaluate/Create.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards: 5 Layer 1 (Foundation), 7 Layer 2 (Components), 7 Layer 3 (Implementation), 6 Layer 4 (Integration).
  Use descriptions provided.

  - Active Learning: Inspire 20% of cards with ties to: [Insert the 3 activities].


  **Output Format:** JSON array of 25 flashcards, each: {"id":1, "bloom_level":"APPLY", "scaffolding_layer":"Layer 2", "front":"Question
  text or MCQ", "back":{"answer":"...","explanation":"...","distractors":["A:...","B:...","C:..." ] if MCQ, "active_learning_link":"...","sources":["MITRE
  ATT&CK"]}}. Follow exact flashcard_schema: Varied types, distractors only for MCQs (3 per), comprehensive explanations.


  Generate cards ensuring completeness (e.g., CMF details, best practice processes: capture-identify-codify-store-iterate),
  alignment to voter priorities (explicit CTI feedback to KM), and research context (CTI definitions, frameworks).'
