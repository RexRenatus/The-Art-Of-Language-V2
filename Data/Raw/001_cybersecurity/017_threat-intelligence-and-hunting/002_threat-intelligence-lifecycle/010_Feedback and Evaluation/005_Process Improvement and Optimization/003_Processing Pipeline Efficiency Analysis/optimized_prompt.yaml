active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a SOC facing evolving ransomware threats, debate how pipeline inefficiencies (e.g., high latency in
    enrichment) impact MTTD/MTTR. Propose one efficiency metric to prioritize and defend your choice using real-world examples
    from MITRE ATT&CK.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truth (e.g., valid metric but wrong context), 3) Extreme/opposite (e.g., ignore real-time needs). Base on voter
    priorities, research pitfalls (e.g., overlooking STIX), and frequent errors in threat intel (e.g., metric misapplication).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Processing Pipeline Efficiency
  Analysis'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > 003_Threat Intelligence Lifecycle > 007_Feedback
  and Evaluation > Process Improvement and Optimization > Processing Pipeline Efficiency Analysis).


  Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (use provided objectives), active learning (inspired by discussion/peer
  teaching/problem-solving), scaffolding (4 layers: Foundation→Components→Implementation→Integration), and voter consensus
  (prerequisites, big-picture context, frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK/STIX/TAXII/Diamond Model, cross-links to ETL/DevOps/Lean).


  Key context: Pipeline stages (collection, processing/enrichment, analysis/correlation, hypothesis/testing, reporting/dissemination,
  action/remediation). Efficiency: Reduces MTTD/MTTR via metrics (latency, throughput, false positives). Prerequisites: TI
  Lifecycle basics.


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema:

  - Front: Varied question types.

  - Back: {answer, explanation (pedagogical ties), references, related_objective, distractors (MCQ only)}.


  Balance: Layers 1-4 (12-13 each), Bloom''s levels per objectives. Distractors per protocol. Ensure measurable, active recall.
  Output ONLY a JSON array of 50 flashcards.'
