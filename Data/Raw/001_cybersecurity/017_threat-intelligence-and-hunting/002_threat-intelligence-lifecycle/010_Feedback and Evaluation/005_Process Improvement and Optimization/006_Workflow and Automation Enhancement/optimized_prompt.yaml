active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of the CTI lifecycle, debate whether full automation of workflow stages like collection
    and analysis would improve or hinder threat hunting effectiveness. Consider potential misconceptions about over-reliance
    on AI, such as reduced human intuition or increased false positives, and reference frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK or the
    Diamond Model.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    human roles''); 2) Related but incorrect term (e.g., SIEM confused with SOAR); 3) Partial truth (e.g., ''Only for collection
    stage''). Ensure distractors test deeper understanding, grounded in voter/research context (e.g., truncated CTI types,
    frameworks).'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in 'Workflow and Automation\
  \ Enhancement' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > 003_Threat Intelligence Lifecycle > 007_Feedback\
  \ and Evaluation > Process Improvement and Optimization > Workflow and Automation Enhancement). Use the provided learning\
  \ objectives, active learning activities, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema to create 50 high-quality flashcards.\n\
  \nIncorporate:\n- University pedagogy: Align to Bloom's Taxonomy (mix levels as in objectives).\n- Voter consensus: Complete\
  \ frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK, Diamond Model, NIST CTI, MITRE Engage), SOAR examples (Splunk SOAR/Phantom, Cortex XSOAR/Demisto),\
  \ Python/STIX scripting, SIEM integration, ML/AI optimization.\n- Research: CTI definitions, types (Strategic/Tactical/Operational/Technical),\
  \ threat hunting, automation benefits/risks.\n- Scaffolding progression: Distribute flashcards across layers (15% L1, 25%\
  \ L2, 30% L3, 30% L4).\n\nOutput ONLY a JSON array of 50 flashcards, each following the exact schema:\n{\n  \"id\": 1,\n\
  \  \"front\": \"Question text\",\n  \"back\": {\n    \"answer\": \"...\",\n    \"explanation\": \"...\",\n    \"distractors_explained\"\
