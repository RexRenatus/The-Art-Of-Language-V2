active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In light of privacy regulations like GDPR, debate the trade-offs between protecting personal data in
    WHOIS records (e.g., redaction of registrant details) and the needs of threat intelligence analysts for actionable OSINT.
    Provide examples of cases where redacted WHOIS data hindered investigations, such as phishing campaigns or malware C2
    domains.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL ARRAY FROM learning_objectives]

  - Active Learning Context: Use discussion/peer/problem-solving to inspire critical cards (e.g., GDPR debates, red flag analysis).

  - Scaffolding: Generate cards progressively across 4 layers: [INSERT FULL scaffolding OBJECT].


  Output 50 flashcards strictly following this schema: [INSERT FULL flashcard_schema]. Format as JSON array of objects, each
  with ''type'', ''front'', ''back'' (nested as specified). Ensure cards promote Bloom''s progression, active recall, and
  TI relevance (e.g., phishing IOCs). Use real tools/examples (whois.icann.org). Distractors per protocol. No duplicates;
  vary phrasing.'
