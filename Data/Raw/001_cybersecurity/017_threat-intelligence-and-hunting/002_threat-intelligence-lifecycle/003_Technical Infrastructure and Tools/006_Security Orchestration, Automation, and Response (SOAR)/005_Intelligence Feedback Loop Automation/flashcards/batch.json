        "core_logic": "Confidence scoring assigns a level of certainty to threat intelligence, indicating its reliability. In an automated feedback loop, this score is crucial for prioritizing actions. High-confidence intelligence can automatically trigger hunts or response playbooks, while lower-confidence items might be flagged for analyst review. This prioritization is essential because it ensures that automated systems focus on the most actionable and reliable data, thereby optimizing resource allocation and reducing false positives.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The first distractor conflates scoring with source validation. The second overstates automation's ability to determine severity independently. The third suggests an overly aggressive filtering approach that might discard potentially useful, albeit low-confidence, intelligence.",
        "analogy": "Confidence is like a 'star rating' for news articles. A 5-star article (high confidence) is more likely to be shared automatically with your friends (triggering hunts/responses) than a 1-star article (low confidence), which might be put aside for later consideration."
