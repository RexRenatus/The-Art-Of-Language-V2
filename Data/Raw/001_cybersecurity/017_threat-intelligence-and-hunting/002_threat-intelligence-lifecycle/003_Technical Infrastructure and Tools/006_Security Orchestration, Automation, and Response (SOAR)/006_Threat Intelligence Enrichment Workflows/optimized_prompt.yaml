  **Core Content Summary (Web-Grounded, Voter-Completed):** Threat intelligence enrichment augments raw data with context
  (e.g., IOCs like IPs/hashes via VirusTotal; TTPs via MITRE ATT&CK) for actionable insights. Full TI Lifecycle: 1. Planning
  & Direction (set priorities), 2. Collection (raw IOCs), 3. Processing & Exploitation (normalize), 4. Analysis (enrich/transform
  data), 5. Production (reports), 6. Dissemination (share), 7. Feedback (iterate). SOAR integration: Automate via Splunk SOAR/Cortex
  XSOAR playbooks. Examples: Enrich IP -> VirusTotal scan -> ATT&CK mapping -> hunting alert. Misconceptions: Enrichment ≠
  collection (adds value post-collection). Sources: cybelangel.com, MITRE ATT&CK.


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the 6 objectives from above].

  - Scaffolding: Generate cards across 4 layers [Insert scaffolding descriptions].

  - Active Learning Ties: Reference discussions (e.g., prioritize sources), peer teaching (teach phases), problem-solving
  (enrich sample IOC).


  **Flashcard Generation:** Strictly follow schema [Insert full flashcard_schema]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards,
  e.g., [{''type'': ''mcq'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}}]. Ensure university-level rigor: active recall, spaced repetition
  friendly, Bloom''s progression. Voter Consensus: 85.7% approval emphasizes completeness, pedagogy, SOAR examples.'
