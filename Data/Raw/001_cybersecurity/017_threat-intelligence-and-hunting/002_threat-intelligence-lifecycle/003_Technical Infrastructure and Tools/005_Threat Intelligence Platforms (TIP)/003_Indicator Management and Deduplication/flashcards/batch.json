This is crucial for automated ingestion, correlation across diverse data sources, and efficient sharing, thereby enhancing the speed and effectiveness of threat detection and response.",

        "analogy": "Using STIX for IoCs is like using a universal language for international trade; it ensures everyone understands the product descriptions (IoCs) consistently, enabling smoother transactions (threat intelligence sharing) and automated processing."
