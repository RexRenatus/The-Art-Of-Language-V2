active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a threat intelligence platform, debate the challenges of normalizing IoCs from diverse sources like
    open-source feeds, commercial providers, and internal SIEMs into STIX format. What standardization trade-offs impact hunting
    efficiency? (e.g., interoperability vs. flexibility)
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Core Content:

  - Aggregation: Collect from sources (open-source e.g., AlienVault OTX, commercial e.g., Recorded Future, internal SIEM/IDS).
  Normalization: To STIX 2.1 (OASIS standard: https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1.0/os/stix-v2.1.0-os.html). STIX: SDOs
  (Indicator, Threat Actor), SCOs (IPv4-Address, File), SROs (relationships). TAXII 2.1 (https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/taxii/v2.1/os/taxii-v2.1-os.html):
  HTTPS transport, servers (advertise collections/channels), clients (poll/subscribe). TIPs: MISP, OpenCTI. Sources: MITRE
  (https://attack.mitre.org), OASIS docs.
