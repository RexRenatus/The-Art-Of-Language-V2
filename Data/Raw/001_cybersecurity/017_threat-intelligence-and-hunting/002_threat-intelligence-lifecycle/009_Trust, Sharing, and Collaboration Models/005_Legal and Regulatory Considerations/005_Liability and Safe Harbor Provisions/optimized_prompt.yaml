  **Topic Context:**

  Title: Liability and Safe Harbor Provisions

  Category: Cybersecurity | Domain: Threat Intelligence And Hunting | Subdomain: 003_Threat Intelligence Lifecycle | Entry:
  010_Trust, Sharing, and Collaboration Models | Legal and Regulatory Considerations.

  Voter Consensus: 100% approval on pedagogy, activities, integration.

  Research: Safe harbors provide affirmative defenses for compliant programs (NIST CSF, ISO 27001, NIST SP 800-53). Protects
  against punitive damages post-breach.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list from above]

  **Active Learning (for flashcard extensions):** [Insert discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving from above]

  **Scaffolding Content:** Generate flashcards proportionally (Layer 1: 30%, Layer 2: 25%, Layer 3: 25%, Layer 4: 20%). Cover
  all layers: [Insert full scaffolding from above]

  **Concept Map Integration:** Flashcards should reference connections (e.g., ''How does safe harbor link to threat intel
  sharing?'').


  **Generation Instructions:**

  - Create EXACTLY 25 flashcards spanning all Bloom''s levels (4-5 per level) and layers.

  - Variety: 40% MCQ, 30% basic Q&A, 20% cloze, 10% application scenarios.

  - Ensure progression: Early cards foundational; later integrate/create.

  - Strictly follow flashcard_generation_schema format (JSON array).

  - High-quality: Active recall, spaced repetition friendly, misconception-busting.

  - No external additions; base solely on provided content/research.'
