active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between stringent cross-border data transfer regulations (e.g., GDPR data localization
    requirements) and the urgency of sharing threat intelligence (IOCs/TTPs) during active cyber incidents like ransomware
    campaigns. Use real-world examples such as the Colonial Pipeline attack to support arguments, and vote on the most balanced
    compliance approach.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions (e.g., wrong Article number like 'Article 25'
      instead of 49; incorrect countries like 'Russia' instead of DOJ DSP list).
    - 'Distractor types: 1 near-miss (similar but imprecise), 1 overgeneralization (too broad), 1 unrelated/false analogy.'
    - Ensure distractors promote critical thinking (e.g., mixing GDPR with US laws).
    - 'Balance: 60% MCQs, 20% true/false with explanation, 20% application scenarios.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university-level pedagogy

  - Learning objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM JSON]

  - Scaffolding layers: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM JSON] (distribute flashcards evenly).

  - Active learning: Embed 3-5 flashcards as ''activity starters'' linking to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving prompts.

  - Key content: GDPR (adequacy decisions, SCCs, Article 49), DOJ DSP (countries of concern, govt data restrictions), EU-US
  DPF, APEC CBPRs, Schrems II case study, implications for IOC/TTP sharing, anonymization/federated learning.

  - Research grounding: Definitions (cross-border transfer, data localization, sensitive data); lifecycle impacts.


  Strictly follow flashcard schema: [PASTE FULL SCHEMA FROM JSON]. Output as JSON array of objects, each with ''front'' and
  ''back'' keys. Ensure distractors are plausible. Make explanations educational and tied to real-world threat hunting. No
  additional text outside JSON.'
