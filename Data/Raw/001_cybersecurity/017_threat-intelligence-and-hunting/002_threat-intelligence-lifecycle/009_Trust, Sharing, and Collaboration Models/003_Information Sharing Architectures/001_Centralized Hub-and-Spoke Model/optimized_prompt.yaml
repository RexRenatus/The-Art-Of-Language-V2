active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using a Centralized Hub-and-Spoke Model versus decentralized
    models for threat hunting in a multi-national enterprise. Consider factors like scalability, data privacy (e.g., GDPR
    compliance), and response time to emerging threats. Support arguments with references to NIST SP 800-150.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
