active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between adopting global standards like STIX/TAXII versus
    developing custom taxonomies for a niche community of interest. Provide evidence from real-world CTI sharing examples
    and evaluate impacts on threat hunting efficiency.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    ATT&CK terms). Ensure distractors test nuance without being obvious.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Threat Intelligence and\
  \ Hunting. Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on 'Shared Taxonomy and Terminology Standards' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity\
  \ > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > 003_Threat Intelligence Lifecycle > 010_Trust, Sharing, and Collaboration Models >\
  \ Community of Interest Development > Shared Taxonomy and Terminology Standards).\n\nIncorporate these pedagogical elements:\n\
  - Learning Objectives: [REMEMBER: Recall definitions of STIX, TAXII, machine tags; UNDERSTAND: Explain standardization role;\
  \ APPLY: Use STIX for threats; ANALYZE: Compare STIX vs. custom/MITRE; EVALUATE: Critique TAXII effectiveness; CREATE: Design\
  \ schemas].\n- Active Learning Tie-Ins: Link cards to discussions (pros/cons of standards), peer teaching (explain a standard),\
  \ problem-solving (implement in MISP/OpenCTI).\n- Scaffolding: Distribute evenly across 4 layers – Layer 1: Foundation (CTI,\
  \ taxonomy basics); Layer 2: Components (STIX SDOs/SCOs, TAXII channels, MITRE ATT&CK, MISP, OpenCTI); Layer 3: Implementation\
  \ (tools integration, best practices); Layer 4: Integration (lifecycle, hunting automation).\n- Ensure progression: 40%\
  \ lower Bloom's (remember/understand), 30% apply/analyze, 30% evaluate/create.\n- Complete coverage: STIX (full objects/relationships),\
  \ TAXII (collections, secure exchange), MITRE ATT&CK (TTPs), MISP/OpenCTI; machine tags; why standards matter (reduce errors,\
  \ enable automation).\n\nFollow this exact Flashcard Schema for each:\n{\n  'front': 'Question [Bloom: LEVEL] [Layer: X]',\n\
  \  'back': {\n    'answer': '**Correct Answer**',\n    'explanation': 'Detailed explanation with example, active learning\
  \ link, best practices...',\n    'distractors': ['D1 (why wrong)', 'D2 (why wrong)', 'D3 (why wrong)'],\n    'references':\
  \ ['https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/ (STIX)', 'https://oasis-open.github.io/cta/taxii/ (TAXII)', 'https://attack.mitre.org/\
  \ (ATT&CK)', 'https://www.misp-project.org/ (MISP)', 'https://www.opencti.io/ (OpenCTI)']\n  },\n  'metadata': {'bloom_level':\
  \ 'LEVEL', 'layer': 'X', 'hierarchy': 'Full hierarchy string'}\n}\n\nOutput ONLY a JSON array of 50 unique flashcards. Vary\
  \ formats (MCQ 60%, cloze 20%, short answer 20%). Ensure distractors are plausible. Sources for credibility: OASIS CTI (STIX/TAXII),\
  \ MITRE ATT&CK, MISP Project, OpenCTI docs."
