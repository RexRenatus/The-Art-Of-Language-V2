active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of relying on third-party mediated trust for threat intelligence
    in light of the SolarWinds supply chain attack. How do standards like NIST SP 800-161 Rev. 1 mitigate risks, and what
    internal controls should organizations retain? Support arguments with evidence from threat intelligence platforms like
    AlienVault OTX or MISP.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse mediated trust with direct
    trust); 2) Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ignore standards); 3) Real-world reversal (e.g., attribute SolarWinds
    success to third parties). Ensure distractors test nuance at progressive complexity.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Mediated Trust Through
  Third Parties'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > 003_Threat Intelligence Lifecycle >
  010_Trust, Sharing, and Collaboration Models > Trust Model Frameworks > Mediated Trust Through Third Parties). Prerequisites:
  Basic cybersecurity and TI lifecycle knowledge.


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Scaffolding: 4 layers [insert full scaffolding above], with real-world examples (SolarWinds supply chain attack, Log4j
  vulnerability, platforms: AlienVault OTX, MISP) and NIST SP 800-161 Rev. 1 (Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management for
  third-party risks).

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to discussion/activities for engagement.

  - Sources: NIST SP 800-161 Rev. 1 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-161r1), AlienVault OTX (https://otx.alienvault.com),
  MISP (https://misp-project.org).


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards spanning Bloom''s levels and layers (balanced: 6 Layer 1, 6 Layer 2, 7 Layer 3, 6 Layer
  4). Use exact schema:

  Front: ''Q: [Scenario?] [Question]? A) ... B) ... C) ... D) ...''

  Back: ''Correct: [Letter] - [Explanation]. Distractors: A) [Why wrong]; B) [Why wrong]; C) [Why wrong]. Reference: [Layer/Objective/Example/Source].''


  Distractors: Follow protocol for plausibility. Ensure university-level rigor, active recall, spaced repetition optimization.
  Output as numbered list.'
