active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages and risks of relying on mandated trust (e.g., via NIST SP
    800-171) versus earned trust for sharing threat intelligence across organizations. Consider real-world scenarios involving
    CUI protection during APT hunts and how legal mandates impact collaboration.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
