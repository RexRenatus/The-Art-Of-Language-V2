    <discussion_prompt>In a group discussion, debate the advantages and risks of relying on mandated trust (e.g., via NIST SP 800-171) versus earned trust for sharing threat intelligence across organizations. Consider real-world scenarios involving CUI protection during APT hunts and how legal mandates impact collaboration.</discussion_prompt>
