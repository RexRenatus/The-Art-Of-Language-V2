  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Threat intelligence is more critical to the Recover function
    than to the Respond function in NIST CSF.'' Support your position with examples from MITRE ATT&CK persistence tactics
    and NIST SP 800-61, considering real-world breach recovery scenarios like ransomware.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    ignoring TI''), 2) Partial truth (e.g., ''TI only for detection, not recovery''), 3) Confusable term (e.g., mix Respond
    activities like containment). Ensure plausibility from voter-noted errors like phase confusion.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST CSF and Threat Intelligence.
  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Recover Function Intelligence Support'' (Category: Cybersecurity > Threat
  Intelligence And Hunting > 003_Threat Intelligence Lifecycle > 001_Intelligence Frameworks and Models > NIST Cybersecurity
  Framework Integration > Recover Function Intelligence Support). Use the provided Topic Hierarchy for context.


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: Embed prompts referencing discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving in explanations.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers – Layer 1 Foundation (10 cards: basics/NIST definitions), Layer 2 Components
  (15 cards: frameworks/TI relationships/MITRE ATT&CK persistence e.g., T1547), Layer 3 Implementation (15 cards: procedures/NIST
  SP 800-61 steps/MCQs with assessments), Layer 4 Integration (10 cards: cross-links/optimization/sources).

  - Prior Knowledge: Link to Respond function and Intelligence Frameworks.

  - Completeness: Include full MITRE ATT&CK recovery mappings (e.g., eliminate persistence post-incident); Sources: NIST CSF
  2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r3.pdf),
