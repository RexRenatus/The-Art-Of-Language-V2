learning_objectives:
  analyze:
  - objective: Analyze the threat intelligence lifecycle (Planning & Direction, Collection, Processing & Exploitation, Analysis
      & Production, Dissemination, Feedback) and compare it to MITRE ATT&CK framework for identifying adversary behaviors.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  create:
  - objective: Design a threat intelligence collection plan tailored to an organization's scope, incorporating diverse sources,
      ISO 27002 implementation steps, and integration with MITRE ATT&CK.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  understand:
  - objective: Explain the purpose of Annex A 5.7 in ISO 27001:2022, including how it mandates organizations to collect, analyze,
      and produce threat intelligence to understand and mitigate information security threats.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Apply Annex A 5.7 requirements by mapping sample IoCs or TTPs from a threat feed to an organization's assets
      and proposing initial mitigation steps.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  remember:
  - objective: Define key terms associated with Annex A 5.7, including Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), Indicators of Compromise
      (IoCs), Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), and types of threat intelligence (strategic, tactical, operational).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  evaluate:
  - objective: Evaluate the effectiveness of a given threat intelligence program against Annex A 5.7 criteria, identifying
      gaps such as over-reliance on automated feeds versus human analysis.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one learner explains the six stages of the threat intelligence lifecycle (Planning & Direction,
    Collection, Processing & Exploitation, Analysis & Production, Dissemination, Feedback); the partner teaches it back using
    a hand-drawn diagram, incorporating Annex A 5.7 requirements.
  problem_solving: 'Analyze the Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) vulnerability case study: Identify IoCs (e.g., JNDI strings) and
    TTPs (e.g., exploit development), map them to MITRE ATT&CK (TA0001 Initial Access), apply Annex A 5.7 by proposing collection
    processes and mitigations, then share solutions in a group debrief.'

      artifacts).'
    - 'Common pitfalls: Reflect voter-noted errors like ''threat intel = alerts only'' vs. full lifecycle.'
    - 'Progressive difficulty: Layer 1 distractors = factual errors; Layer 4 = nuanced trade-offs (e.g., automated vs. curated).'
    - 'Balance: 40% definition-based, 30% application errors, 30% integration misconceptions.'
    - 'MCQ format: 1 correct, 3 distractors; label subtly tempting ones.'
