  <learning_objectives level="bloom_taxonomy">
    <objective level="remember" measurable="true">Define key terms associated with Annex A 5.7, including Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), and types of threat intelligence (strategic, tactical, operational).</objective>
    <objective level="understand" measurable="true">Explain the purpose of Annex A 5.7 in ISO 27001:2022, including how it mandates organizations to collect, analyze, and produce threat intelligence to understand and mitigate information security threats.</objective>
    <objective level="apply" measurable="true">Apply Annex A 5.7 requirements by mapping sample IoCs or TTPs from a threat feed to an organization's assets and proposing initial mitigation steps.</objective>
    <objective level="analyze" measurable="true">Analyze the threat intelligence lifecycle (Planning &amp; Direction, Collection, Processing &amp; Exploitation, Analysis &amp; Production, Dissemination, Feedback) and compare it to MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework for identifying adversary behaviors.</objective>
    <objective level="evaluate" measurable="true">Evaluate the effectiveness of a given threat intelligence program against Annex A 5.7 criteria, identifying gaps such as over-reliance on automated feeds versus human analysis.</objective>
    <objective level="create" measurable="true">Design a threat intelligence collection plan tailored to an organization's scope, incorporating diverse sources, ISO 27002 implementation steps, and integration with MITRE ATT&amp;CK.</objective>

    <discussion_prompt>How would you apply this concept in your work environment?</discussion_prompt>
    <peer_teaching>In pairs, one learner explains the six stages of the threat intelligence lifecycle (Planning &amp; Direction, Collection, Processing &amp; Exploitation, Analysis &amp; Production, Dissemination, Feedback); the partner teaches it back using a hand-drawn diagram, incorporating Annex A 5.7 requirements.</peer_teaching>
    <problem_solving>Analyze the Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) vulnerability case study: Identify IoCs (e.g., JNDI strings) and TTPs (e.g., exploit development), map them to MITRE ATT&amp;CK (TA0001 Initial Access), apply Annex A 5.7 by proposing collection processes and mitigations, then share solutions in a group debrief.</problem_solving>
