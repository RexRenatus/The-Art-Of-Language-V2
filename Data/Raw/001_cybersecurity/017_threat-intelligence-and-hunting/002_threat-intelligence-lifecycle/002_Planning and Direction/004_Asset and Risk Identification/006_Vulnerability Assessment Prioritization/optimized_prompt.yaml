active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given limited remediation resources, debate whether organizations should prioritize vulnerabilities using
    only CVSS Base Scores or integrate threat intelligence, asset criticality, and business impact. Provide real-world examples
    like Log4Shell (high CVSS, actively exploited) vs. a niche low-impact vulnerability.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Research Context (Complete Summary):** Vulnerability assessment prioritization ranks risks amid finite resources. Core
  concepts: Vulnerability (system weakness); Threat Intelligence (threat info for decisions); Threat Hunting (proactive malware
  search); Risk (likelihood x impact x threat). Prioritization assesses beyond severity using CVSS, EPSS, etc.


  **CVSS v4.0 (FIRST.org):** Open standard (0-10 score). Base Metrics: Attack Vector (N/R/A), Attack Complexity (L/H), Privileges
  Required (N/L/H), User Interaction (N/R), Scope (U/C), Impact (CIA subscores). Temporal: Exploit Code Maturity (X/H/F),
  Remediation Level (X/U/W/O), Report Confidence (X/C/R). Environmental: Modified Base + Confidentiality/Integrity/Availability
  Requirements (H/M/L), Modified Scope. NIST guidance (SP 800-40): Use for scanning/patching prioritization.


  **Other Frameworks:** EPSS (FIRST.org/epss: exploit probability 0-1); SSVC (CISA: categorize by automation, technical impact,
  etc.); CISA KEV (known exploited vulns catalog).


  **Best Practices:** Integrate CVSS + threat intel + asset criticality. NIST SP 800-30 for risk; build on asset inventories.


  **Sources:** FIRST.org/cvss, FIRST.org/epss, cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities, NIST SP 800-30/40/8011.


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list from JSON above].

  - Active Learning: Inspire cards from discussion (CVSS vs. integrated), peer teaching (CVSS metrics explain/quiz), problem-solving
  (scan report prioritization).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 30% Layer 3, 20% Layer 4. Progress from remember to create.


  **Task:** Generate exactly 50 high-quality flashcards covering all objectives, layers, and Bloom levels proportionally.
  Use Flashcard Schema exactly: JSON array of objects. Vary types per protocol. Ensure active recall, no hints in front. Make
  explanations educational for self-study.'
