active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the consequences of over-classifying threat intelligence as TLP:RED (e.g.,
    stifled collaboration) versus under-classifying as TLP:GREEN (e.g., source compromise). Use real-world examples from cybersecurity
    incidents to support arguments and propose mitigation strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'D2: Common under-classification (e.g., GREEN instead of AMBER+STRICT).'
    - 'D3: Non-existent or deprecated option (e.g., TLP:YELLOW or TLP:CLEAR).'
    - Ensure distractors are plausible based on voter-noted misconceptions (e.g., incomplete levels like missing WHITE/GREEN).

  **Core Content (Complete TLP Definitions from CISA/FIRST Standards):**

  - **TLP:RED**: Most restrictive. Recipients may not share with any other party. For info that could harm privacy/reputation/ops
  if disclosed further.

  - **TLP:AMBER+STRICT**: Share only within organization; no redistribution to partners without source permission.

  - **TLP:AMBER**: Share within organization and trusted sector/community partners; use care to avoid public release.

  - **TLP:GREEN**: Share within sector/community of interest and family sectors; attribution to source encouraged; no public
  release.

  - **TLP:WHITE**: Unlimited sharing; public release authorized, subject to copyright.


  **TLP Classification Decision Matrix (Table for Decision-Making):**

  | Sensitivity/Audience | Public Release | Community/Sector | Organization Only | Named Recipients |

  |-----------------------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|

  | Low (Non-Sensitive)  | WHITE         | GREEN            | AMBER             | AMBER+STRICT    |

  | Medium (Indicators)  | GREEN         | GREEN            | AMBER             | RED             |

  | High (TTPs/Sources)  | -             | AMBER            | AMBER+STRICT      | RED             |

  | Critical (Victims)   | -             | -                | -                 | RED             |

  Use this matrix based on info sensitivity, audience, and risks.


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the 6 objectives above].

  - Scaffolding: Build cards progressively across 4 layers [Insert scaffolding descriptions].

  - Active Learning Tie-In: Cards should prompt recall for discussions (e.g., risk comparisons), peer teaching (rules), problem-solving
  (scenarios).


  **Generation Instructions:**

  - Use the exact flashcard_schema: Front/Back structure, card types, distractor_protocol.

  - Ensure 40-50 cards: Balanced coverage (all objectives, layers, TLP levels, matrix usage).

  - Incorporate voter priorities: Full TLP levels, Decision Matrix examples, scenario classification.

  - Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''tags'': [...],
  ''source'': ''...''}}, ...]

  - Make explanations educational, linking to Bloom''s levels and real-world (e.g., CISA.gov).'
