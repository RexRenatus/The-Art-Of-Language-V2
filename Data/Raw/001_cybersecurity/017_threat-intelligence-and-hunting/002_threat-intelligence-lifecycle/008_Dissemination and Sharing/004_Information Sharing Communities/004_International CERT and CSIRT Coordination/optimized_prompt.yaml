active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the benefits and challenges of international CERT/CSIRT coordination for
    threat intelligence sharing, considering legal barriers (e.g., GDPR vs. national laws), privacy concerns, and real-world
    examples like the SolarWinds incident. Support arguments with references to FIRST or NIST frameworks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (2) Partial truth (e.g., national-only focus), (3) Extreme/unrealistic (e.g., ignore legal barriers). Base on real errors
    from frameworks like mixing NIST phases.'
