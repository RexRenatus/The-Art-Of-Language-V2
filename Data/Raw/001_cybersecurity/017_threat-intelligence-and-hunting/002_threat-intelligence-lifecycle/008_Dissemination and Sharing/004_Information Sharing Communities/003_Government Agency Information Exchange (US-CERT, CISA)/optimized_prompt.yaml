active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of government agency-led information sharing (e.g., CISA's
    AIS) versus private sector communities (e.g., ISACs). How does this impact threat hunting speed and accuracy? Support
    with real-world examples like SolarWinds.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''US-CERT still operates independently''
    vs. transitioned to CISA); 2) Related but incorrect term (e.g., ''FISMA'' instead of ''AIS''); 3) Partial truth exaggerated
    (e.g., ''CISA only shares with federal agencies'' vs. includes non-federal). Ensure distractors test nuance without being
    obvious.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Threat Intelligence and
  Hunting. Topic: Government Agency Information Exchange (US-CERT, CISA). Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And

  Use this research context: US-CERT (legacy, transitioned to CISA in 2018); CISA operates Federal process for receiving/analyzing/sharing
  threats via AIS (Automated Indicator Sharing for IoCs), HSIN. Definitions: Cyber Threat Information (IoCs/TTPs); CTI (threat
  attributes); Defensive Measure (mitigation actions); Cybersecurity Purpose (protection). Partnerships: ISACs. Real-world:
  SolarWinds.
