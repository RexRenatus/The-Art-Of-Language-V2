active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the pros and cons of using email versus secure messaging platforms (e.g., Signal or Microsoft
    Teams) for disseminating urgent threat intelligence reports containing IoCs. Consider factors like speed, auditability,
    encryption strength, and compliance with NIST SP 800-177. Provide evidence from real-world breaches where poor dissemination
    led to issues.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in threat intelligence. Generate\
  \ high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized flashcards for the topic: 'Email and Messaging Platform Distribution' (Topic\
  \ Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > 003_Threat Intelligence Lifecycle > 006_Dissemination and\
  \ Sharing > Intelligence Delivery Mechanisms > Email and Messaging Platform Distribution). Focus on SECURE dissemination\
  \ of TI (IoCs, reports, TTPs) via email (SPF/DKIM/DMARC, PGP/S/MIME) and messaging (Slack/Teams E2EE, permissions), per\
  \ NIST SP 800-177, STIX/TAXII.\n\nIncorporate:\n- Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST HERE]\n- Scaffolding Layers: [PASTE\
  \ FULL LAYERS HERE]\n- Active Learning: Tie flashcards to discussion/peer/problem-solving (e.g., scenario cards).\n- Bloom's\
