active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a resource-constrained SOC, should you prioritize breadth (integrating many TI feeds) or depth (few
    high-quality feeds like those with MITRE ATT&CK mappings) for SIEM integration? Debate with evidence from current threat
    landscapes, such as ransomware campaigns relying on specific IoCs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 50 high-quality Anki-style flashcards optimized for spaced repetition, covering:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Incorporate prompts/activities as card hints or explanations.

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE] – Distribute cards evenly (12-13 per layer).

  - Research Context: SIEM (centralized log analysis, e.g., Splunk/ELK/QRadar); TI Feeds (IoCs, TTPs, malicious IPs/URLs/hashes);
  Standards (STIX/TAXII, API ingestion, normalization); Best Practices (parsing rules, alerting, MITRE ATT&CK/D3FEND integration);
  Examples (threat hunting simulations, SOC case studies); Prerequisites (basic logging/TI stages).


  Use Flashcard Schema: [INSERT FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Ensure cards progress Bloom''s Taxonomy (e.g., 10 remember/understand,
  15 apply/analyze, 15 evaluate/create, 10 mixed). Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'',
  ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'']}, ''tags'': [''bloom:remember'', ''layer:1'']}, ...]. Make
  explanations pedagogical, linking to voter consensus (70% approval on pedagogy/completeness).'
