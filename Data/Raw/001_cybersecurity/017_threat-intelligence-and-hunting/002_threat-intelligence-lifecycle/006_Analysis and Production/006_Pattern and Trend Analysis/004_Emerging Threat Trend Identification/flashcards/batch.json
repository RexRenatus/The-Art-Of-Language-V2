      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The advisory highlighted a critical finding: local administrator accounts were shared across many workstations, used non-unique passwords, and these credentials were stored in plaintext scripts. This configuration created a severe security vulnerability, allowing attackers easy access to administrative privileges and facilitating lateral movement throughout the network.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The finding was the presence of insecurely managed admin accounts, not their universal disabling or restriction. The passwords were non-unique and plaintext, not just unrotated unique ones. Access was found to be unrestricted, not limited to bastion hosts.",
        "analogy": "It's like finding that the janitor's master key to all the offices is labeled 'Master Key' and left in the breakroom, making it easy for anyone to access any office."
