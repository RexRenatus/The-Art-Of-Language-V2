  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors: 1 common misconception (e.g., confuse LOTL with malware drops),
    1 related but incorrect term (e.g., LOLBins vs. custom malware), 1 edge case (e.g., benign use of tool). Ensure distractors
    are web-grounded from research (e.g., legitimate vs. anomalous PowerShell use). Balance difficulty across Bloom''s levels.'

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list above].

  - Active Learning: [Insert discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving above]. Reference in explanations.

  - Scaffolding: 4 layers [Insert full scaffolding above]. Tag flashcards by layer.

  - Research Context: Threat Intelligence (collect/analyze/disseminate threats/TTPs), Threat Hunting (proactive hypothesis-driven),
  LOTL (abuse legit tools), LOLBins (e.g., cmd.exe, PowerShell.exe, wmic.exe, ntdsutil.exe, psexec.exe), Adversary Tradecraft
  (methods/tools), AI-Enabled Tradecraft (GenAI automation/deception). Frameworks: MITRE ATT&CK (TTPs knowledge base), NIST
  Lifecycle (Planning/Collection/Processing/Analysis-Production/Dissemination). Sources: MITRE ATT&CK, cybersecurity reports
  on AI threats.
