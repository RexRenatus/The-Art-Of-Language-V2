active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the implications of vulnerability chaining for proactive threat hunting
    against APTs. How does it shift from reactive vulnerability management to holistic attack path defense? Provide real-world
    examples like Log4Shell chains and reference MITRE ATT&CK tactics.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    tactics/techniques or single vs. chained vulns). Provide ''text'' (concise, answer-like) and ''explanation'' (why wrong,
    educational value). Vary types: 1 partial truth, 1 misconception, 1 unrelated.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 20-30 high-quality flashcards
  on ''Vulnerability Chaining and Attack Path Analysis'' strictly adhering to the provided schema. Distribute across Bloom''s
  levels (at least 3 per level from the list) and scaffolding layers (5 per layer). Incorporate active learning examples (e.g.,
  Log4Shell chaining) for application questions.


  Topic Context: Vulnerability chaining links exploits sequentially (e.g., initial access to lateral movement). Attack path
  analysis visualizes paths using MITRE ATT&CK (tactics/techniques). Big picture: Proactive APT defense in threat hunting.
