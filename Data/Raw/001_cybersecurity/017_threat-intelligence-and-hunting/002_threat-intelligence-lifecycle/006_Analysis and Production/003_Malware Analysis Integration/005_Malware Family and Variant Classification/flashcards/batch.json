        "core_logic": "Phase 1 of the FIRST Malware Analysis Framework focuses on identifying and establishing reliable sources for acquiring malware samples. This is crucial because CSIRTs need timely access to relevant threats to protect their constituents, ensuring that the samples collected are actively posing a risk, thereby enabling effective incident response and threat intelligence, because having timely access to samples is the first step in understanding and mitigating threats.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors misrepresent the phase's purpose by focusing on tool development, legal aspects, or creator motivation, rather than the core task of sample acquisition.",
        "analogy": "Identifying malware collection sources is like setting up a reliable supply chain for critical materials; you need to know where to get the necessary samples (malware) to perform your work (analysis)."
