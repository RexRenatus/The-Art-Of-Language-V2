active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of public naming conventions for threat actors (e.g.,
    APT groups) versus using activity clusters. How does rebranding challenge these conventions, and what role does the Admiralty
    System play in attribution confidence? Support arguments with real-world examples from MITRE ATT&CK or Unit42 reports.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Rebranding Detection).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use elements for scenario-based cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [PASTE FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM ABOVE]. Tag each card with ''layer'' (1-4).

  - Research Context: Cover rebranding (name/TTP/tooling/targeting/narrative changes), attribution, activity clusters, temporary
  threat groups, MITRE ATT&CK, Diamond Model, Admiralty System (Possible/Probable/Confirmed).

  - Prior Knowledge: Link to threat actor classification/taxonomy.

  - Concept Map: Rebranding Detection → TTP Evolution/Name Changes/MITRE ATT&CK/Diamond Model → Activity Clusters.

  - Sources: MITRE ATT&CK (attack.mitre.org), Diamond Model (flemmingss.com/diamond), Unit42 (unit42.paloaltonetworks.com),
  Admiralty from threat intel standards.


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards following the exact schema: [PASTE FULL FLASHCARD_SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Ensure progression
  per Bloom''s Taxonomy, active recall, and distractors. Balance: 10 foundational, 15 component, 15 implementation, 10 integration.
  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects.'
