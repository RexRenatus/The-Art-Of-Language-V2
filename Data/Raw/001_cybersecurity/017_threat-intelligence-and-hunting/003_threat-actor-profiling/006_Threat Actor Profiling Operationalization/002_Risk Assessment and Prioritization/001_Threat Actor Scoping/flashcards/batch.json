        "core_logic": "Threat actor scoping aims to build a comprehensive profile of adversaries, including their motivations, capabilities, and preferred TTPs. This understanding is crucial because it allows organizations to prioritize defenses, anticipate threats, and allocate resources effectively, moving beyond reactive measures to proactive threat mitigation.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly define threat actor scoping by limiting it to IoCs, automated blocking, or perfect prediction, rather than its core purpose of understanding adversary behavior for strategic defense planning.",
        "analogy": "Scoping a threat actor is like profiling a criminal organization: understanding who they are, what they want, and how they operate, so law enforcement can better anticipate and prevent their next move."
