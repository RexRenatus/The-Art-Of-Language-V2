active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of live data extraction (e.g., using DumpIt for memory dumps
    during active incidents) versus dead acquisition (e.g., full disk imaging with FTK Imager). Use real-world examples from
    APT campaigns to argue when each is preferable for preserving evidence in threat actor profiling.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Related but incorrect tool/technique (e.g., use ELK for memory dumps), 3) Partial truth exaggerated (e.g., ''always prefer
    live acquisition for speed'' ignoring volatility). Ensure distractors are plausible for cybersecurity learners and teach
    via explanation.'

  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives** (Bloom''s Taxonomy): [Paste the full learning_objectives array here].

  - **Scaffolding Layers**: Build content progressively: [Paste the full scaffolding_layers array here].

  - **Active Learning Tie-Ins**: Reference discussion/activities in explanations (e.g., ''As in peer teaching, Volatility
  steps are...'').

  - **Key Content from Research/Voters**: CTI, Threat Hunting, IOCs/IOAs/TTPs; Techniques: memory forensics (Volatility/DumpIt),
  disk imaging (dd/FTK Imager/EnCase), file carving (Foremost/Scalpel), log parsing (ELK/regex), network analysis (Wireshark);
  Live/dead acquisition, order of volatility; MITRE ATT&CK/NIST integration for profiling. Examples: Extract processes from
  dumps, carve files from images, parse C2 in PCAPs.


  **Task**: Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following the exact schema: [Paste the full flashcard_schema.structure here].

  - Balance: 30% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 40% Evaluate/Create.

  - Ensure university pedagogy: Active recall, spaced repetition friendly, explanations scaffold from basic to advanced.

  - Distractors: Strictly follow [flashcard_schema.distractor_protocol].

  - Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, e.g., [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}}, ...]. No extra text.'
