active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of the Recovery Phase, debate whether organizations should prioritize rapid restoration
    to pre-incident operations or invest time in enhancing resilience during recovery. Use NIST SP 800-184 guidelines (tactical
    vs. strategic recovery) to support your arguments, considering trade-offs in downtime, cost, and future risk. Reference
    connections to prior IR phases like Eradication.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for spaced repetition and active recall, covering these LEARNING OBJECTIVES
  [insert full list above]. Incorporate ACTIVE LEARNING elements as hooks in explanations (e.g., ''Debate this tradeoff as
  in discussion prompt''). Use 4-LAYER SCAFFOLDING progressively: Layer 1 (Foundation: defs/prereqs/IR map), Layer 2 (Components:
  playbooks/NIST), Layer 3 (Implementation: steps), Layer 4 (Integration: Threat Profiling/TI&H).


  Research Context: Recovery Phase restores systems post-eradication, key to resilience. NIST SP 800-61r2 (IR Lifecycle),
  NIST SP 800-184 (Guide for Cybersecurity Event Recovery: tactical recovery (rapid restore) + strategic planning (playbooks/metrics));
  NIST CSF Recover. Connect artifacts to actor TTPs. Sources: NIST docs, SANS IR playbooks.


  Follow FLASHCARD SCHEMA strictly: Output as JSON array of objects [{front: ''...'', back: {answer: ''...'', explanation:
  ''...'', distractors: [''A'',''B'',''C''] (if MCQ), references: ''...'' }}]. Balance types: MCQ (40%, w/ 4 options), Cloze/Short
  Answer (30%), Sequencing (15%), Scenario Apply (15%). Distractors: plausible per protocol. Explanations: pedagogical, tied
  to Bloom''s/scaffolding/objectives/integration.


  Ensure completeness: Map to prior phases (e.g., Eradication prereq), voter priorities (playbooks, NIST phases, simulations).
  No generic cards; all context-specific to Recovery in TI&H/DFIR.'
