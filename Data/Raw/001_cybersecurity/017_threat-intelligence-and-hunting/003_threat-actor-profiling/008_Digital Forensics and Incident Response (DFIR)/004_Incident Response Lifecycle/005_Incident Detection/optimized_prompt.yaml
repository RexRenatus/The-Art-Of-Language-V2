  peer_teaching: 'In pairs: One student explains the differences between Event, Adverse Event, and Cybersecurity Incident
    using real-world examples; the partner teaches back with a peer-chosen scenario from DFIR, then switch roles.'
  problem_solving: Provide simulated logs/network traffic (e.g., anomalous IP, suspicious process execution). Students identify
    IoCs/IoAs, hypothesize threat actor TTPs, declare an incident, and map to NIST SP 800-61 Detection phase.

  **Completed Research Context:** Incident detection identifies malicious activities via monitoring, anomalies, and IoCs/IoAs.
  Core Definitions: Event (observable occurrence); Adverse Cybersecurity Event (potential negative impact); Cybersecurity
  Incident (jeopardizes CIA triad or policies, NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3). IoCs (artifacts like IPs/hashes from TTPs, RFC 8887);
  IoAs (ongoing attack signals, e.g., behaviors); CTI (aggregated, analyzed threat info for actionability). NIST SP 800-61
  Rev. 3 (full): Phases - Preparation (tools/baselines), Detection & Analysis (monitoring/triage), Containment/Eradication/Recovery,
  Post-Incident. NIST CSF: Detect (anomalies, IoCs). Best Practices: SIEM/EDR integration, threat hunting hypotheses, MITRE
  ATT&CK TTP mapping. Sources: nvlpubs.nist.gov (SP 800-61r3, SP 800-53), datatracker.ietf.org (RFC 8887 STIX), cynet.com
  (IoAs), mitre.org (ATT&CK), sans.org (DFIR).


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Use these Learning Objectives [insert list above]. Embed Active Learning [insert active_learning
  above]. Follow Scaffolding [insert scaffolding_layers above] for progressive complexity.


  **Task:** Generate 50 high-quality flashcards per the Flashcard Schema [insert flashcard_schema above]. Ensure university-level
  rigor: Bloom''s progression, active recall, distractors for critical thinking. Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'',
  ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''metadata'': {...}}, ''type'': ''MCQ/Cloze/etc.''}]. Vary difficulty;
  reference voter consensus (71.4% approval on completeness/pedagogy).'
