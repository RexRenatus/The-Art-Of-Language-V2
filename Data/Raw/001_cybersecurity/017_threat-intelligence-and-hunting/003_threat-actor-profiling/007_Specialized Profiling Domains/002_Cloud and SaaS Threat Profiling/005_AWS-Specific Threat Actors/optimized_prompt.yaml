active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the most critical AWS misconfigurations (e.g., overly permissive IAM roles)
    exploited by financially motivated actors like Scattered Spider versus nation-state groups. Support arguments with MITRE
    ATT&CK mappings and real-world reports from Mandiant or CrowdStrike.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions: 1) Similar TTPs from different
    stages/actors (e.g., AssumeRole as Persistence vs. Privilege Escalation), 2) Confused AWS services (e.g., S3 vs. EC2 exploits),
    3) Real but incorrect actors/motivations (e.g., attribute LAPSUS$ TTPs to UNC2452). Ensure distractors are 70% plausible
    to promote analysis.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in AWS-Specific Threat Actors
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Actor Profiling > 006_Specialized Profiling Domains
  > Cloud and SaaS Threat Profiling > AWS-Specific Threat Actors).


  Synthesize COMPLETE, authoritative content based on voter priorities: Fully cover truncated sections (e.g., Privilege Escalation:
  Exploiting Misconfigurations like public S3 buckets, IAM over-permissions via AssumeRole). Map ALL MITRE ATT&CK for Cloud
  stages: Reconnaissance, Initial Access (compromised creds), Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion,
  Credential Access, Discovery (Enumerate IAM/S3), Lateral Movement (cross-account roles), Collection, Exfiltration (S3 downloads),
  Impact (crypto-mining, ransomware). Profile named actors: UNC3944/Scattered Spider (social engineering + IAM abuse), LAPSUS$
  (credential stuffing + persistence), UNC2452 (supply chain + lateral), UNC1945 (VMware but AWS pivots), with real examples
  from Mandiant/CrowdStrike/AWS bulletins.


  Sources to reference: AWS Security Blog (GuardDuty findings), MITRE ATT&CK for Cloud (e.g., T1078.004 Cloud Accounts), Mandiant
  M-Trends (cloud breaches), CrowdStrike reports.
