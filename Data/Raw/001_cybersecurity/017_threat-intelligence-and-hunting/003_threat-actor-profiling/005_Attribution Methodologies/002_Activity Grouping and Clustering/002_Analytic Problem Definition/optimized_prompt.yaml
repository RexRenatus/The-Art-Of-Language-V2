    - explain
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In groups, debate whether defining an analytic problem using MITRE ATT&CK tactics (adversary goals/'why')
    versus techniques (specific methods/'how') leads to more effective threat hunting and attribution. Provide real-world
    examples from known campaigns like SolarWinds or APT28, and reference connections to activity clustering.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Active Learning: [insert summaries of discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving]

  - Scaffolding: Build flashcards progressively across 4 layers [insert layer descriptions].

  - Prior knowledge: Assume basics in CTI, threat hunting; anchor to MITRE ATT&CK, full Cyber Kill Chain.

  - Research Context: Analytic Problem = ''what/why/how'' of threat gaps; Hypothesis guides hunting; MITRE ATT&CK for TTPs
  (tactics=''why'', techniques=''how''); links to attribution/clustering.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards per the schema:

  [insert full flashcard_schema above]


  Ensure coverage: 30% Layer 1-2 (recall), 40% Layer 3 (apply), 30% Layer 4 (analyze/evaluate/create). Use real-world examples
  (SolarWinds, APT IOCs). Make engaging, precise, and pedagogically sound for university-level learners.'
