  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Prior Knowledge: Basic TI, IoCs, TTPs, MITRE ATT&CK.

  - Key Content: Definitions (attribution, IoCs, TTPs, clusters); MITRE ATT&CK best practices (full TTP mapping across lifecycle,
  actor overlap analysis); Confidence levels; Validation checklists; Real-world (APT29, nation-states, false flags); Sources
  (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK docs, threat reports).

  - Big Picture: Prevents misattribution, informs hunting/policy.


  Generate flashcards per schema: [INSERT FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Balance across Bloom''s/scaffolding. Ensure university
  pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, distractors promote analysis. Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'':
  ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'',
  ''active_learning_link'': ''...''}}]. Aim for 75 cards.'
