        "core_logic": "Producer bias occurs when intelligence reports disproportionately focus on techniques or actors that the reporting organization frequently encounters or has better visibility into. This can skew an analyst's perception, leading them to potentially assign higher attribution confidence based on limited or biased data, rather than a comprehensive view of all available evidence.",

        "analogy": "If a doctor only sees patients with a specific rare disease, their 'producer bias' might lead them to suspect that rare disease in every new patient, even if common illnesses are more likely."
