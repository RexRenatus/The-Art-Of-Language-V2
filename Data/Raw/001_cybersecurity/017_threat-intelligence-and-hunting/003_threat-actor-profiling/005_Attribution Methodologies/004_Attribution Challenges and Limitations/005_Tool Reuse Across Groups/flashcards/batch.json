        "core_logic": "Because threat actors reuse tools, especially LOLBins, traditional IOCs like file hashes or specific tool signatures become less effective as they can be easily changed or are already present. Therefore, CISA and MITRE emphasize analyzing TTPs – the 'how' and 'why' of tool usage – as a more resilient approach for threat intelligence and hunting [CISA.gov, MITRE.org]. This TTP-based analysis helps identify adversary behavior patterns that persist even when tools change.",
