active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare the TTPs of two historical threat actors (e.g., APT28 vs. APT41) using the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
    In small groups, debate how similarities and differences aid in attribution, threat hunting, and predicting future attacks.
    Support arguments with real-world evidence from sources like MITRE reports.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
