active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the effectiveness of signature-based vs. behavioral detection for DGAs, considering MITRE ATT&CK
    T1568.002. Provide real-world examples from APT campaigns (e.g., Conficker or modern botnets) and evaluate trade-offs
    in false positives/negatives.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
  additional_activities:
  - Think-pair-share on DGA misconceptions (e.g., 'DGAs are truly random' vs. algorithmic predictability).
  - 'Role-play: Students simulate threat actors generating DGAs vs. hunters detecting them, debating TTPs from MITRE ATT&CK.'
  - 'Hands-on: Python simulation of DGA generation (e.g., simple seed-based algo) and detection (entropy/wordlist checks).'

  Incorporate this research context: DGAs are malware techniques for generating pseudorandom domains for C2 communication
  (MITRE ATT&CK T1568.002), evading blacklists. Key concepts: DGA (seed-based algo), C2 servers, IoCs (RFC 9424: observable
  artifacts of attacker TTPs/infrastructure), threat hunting. Detection: entropy analysis, n-gram/wordlist checks, clustering.
  Examples: Conficker. Prerequisites: DNS, malware C2, static IoCs.
