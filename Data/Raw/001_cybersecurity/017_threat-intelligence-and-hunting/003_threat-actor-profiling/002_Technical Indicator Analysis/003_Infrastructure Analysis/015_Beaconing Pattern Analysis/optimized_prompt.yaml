active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how jitter in beaconing (e.g., in Cobalt Strike or SolarWinds campaigns)
    evades signature-based IDS/IPS detection. Propose 2-3 behavioral analytics countermeasures and evaluate their trade-offs
    in false positives for SOC environments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    beaconing), (2) Related but incorrect term (e.g., ''SYN flood'' for jitter), (3) Edge case inversion (e.g., ''no variation''
    for jitter). Ensure 70% plausibility to challenge APPLY/ANALYZE levels; base on real-world errors from sources like MITRE
    case studies.'
