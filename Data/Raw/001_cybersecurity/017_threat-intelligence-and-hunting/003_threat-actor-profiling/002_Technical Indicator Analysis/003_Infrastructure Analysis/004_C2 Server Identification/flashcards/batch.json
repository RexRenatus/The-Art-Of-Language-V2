      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Preemptively blocking adversary infrastructure is often discouraged because attackers can quickly adapt by changing IPs or domains, and maintaining visibility allows defenders to gather intelligence on their methods and track their movements, rather than just reacting to a single indicator.",
