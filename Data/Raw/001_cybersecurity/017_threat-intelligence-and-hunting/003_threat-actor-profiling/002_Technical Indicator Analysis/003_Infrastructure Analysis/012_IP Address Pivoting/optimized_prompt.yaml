active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a threat hunting scenario, how does IP address pivoting from a single IOC reveal broader threat actor
    infrastructure compared to static analysis? Discuss real-world examples from campaigns like SolarWinds and evaluate potential
    pitfalls, such as IP repurposing.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: Generate distractors that are 70% plausible (e.g., real but incorrect attributes like 'port scanning'
    instead of 'passive reconnaissance') to promote critical thinking. Ensure they test subtle distinctions (e.g., active
    vs. passive intel). Avoid random or obvious wrongs.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''IP Address Pivoting''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Actor Profiling > 003_Technical Indicator Analysis
  > Infrastructure Analysis > IP Address Pivoting). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, 4-layer scaffolding
  (Foundation: basics/definitions linking to prior Entry Domain 003; Components: IP attributes like ASN/PTR/passive DNS; Implementation:
  tools/procedures like WHOIS/Shodan/VirusTotal; Integration: MITRE ATT&CK/automation). Incorporate voter consensus (82.9%
  approval): explicit objectives, complete best practices (decompose IPs via ASN/geolocation/rDNS/WHOIS/IOCs), sources (MITRE
  ATT&CK T1590.005, VirusTotal, Shodan).


  Learning Objectives: [Insert the 6 objectives from above].

  Active Learning: Use elements like discussion on pivoting vs. static analysis, peer tool demos, problem-solving with sample
  IPs.
