active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the effectiveness of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) in evading detection
    compared to traditional C2 domains. Propose three countermeasures and evaluate their feasibility in a threat hunting context,
    referencing real-world examples like Conficker malware.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., confuse DGA with static C2), 2) Related but incorrect concept (e.g., mix DNS Abuse with IP spoofing), 3) Superficially
    similar term (e.g., NRD vs expired domain). Ensure distractors are realistic based on research context and avoid obvious
    errors.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Domain Name Analysis''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Actor Profiling > 003_Technical Indicator Analysis
  > Indicators of Compromise (IOC) Analysis > Domain Name Analysis). Voter consensus: 70% approval from 7 voters emphasizing
  Bloom''s Taxonomy, 4-layer scaffolding, prior knowledge links, completeness (DNS Hijacking: compromising DNS records/registrars
  to redirect traffic), tools (WHOIS, Passive DNS), examples, and big picture (infrastructure mapping, TI cycle).


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (balanced: 20% Layer1/REMEMBER-UNDERSTAND, 30% Layer2/APPLY, 25% Layer3/ANALYZE, 25%
  Layer4/EVALUATE-CREATE; 60% MCQ, 20% definition, 20% short answer). Cover all learning objectives, active learning activities,
  scaffolding layers, and research context (DNS, DNS Abuse, CTI, Threat Hunting, NRDs, DGAs, DNS Hijacking, tools like VirusTotal).


  Strictly follow the flashcard_schema: Output ONLY a JSON array of 50 objects. Ensure pedagogical depth: Scaffold from foundation
  to integration, use distractors per protocol, detailed explanations tying to objectives/activities/sources. Promote active
  learning (e.g., reference discussion prompts in explanations).'
