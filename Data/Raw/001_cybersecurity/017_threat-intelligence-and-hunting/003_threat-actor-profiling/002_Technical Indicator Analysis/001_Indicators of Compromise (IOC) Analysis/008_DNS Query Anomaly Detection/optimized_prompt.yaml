active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios might DNS tunneling be preferable to other C2 methods for attackers (e.g., HTTP beacons),
    and what detection challenges does this pose for defenders? Consider factors like firewall evasion and network visibility.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, students take turns explaining a specific DNS anomaly type (e.g., DGA vs. tunneling) using provided
    anonymized log snippets. Partners then quiz each other on detection indicators and threat implications.
  problem_solving: Provide anonymized DNS log data (e.g., high entropy domains, NXDOMAIN spikes). Students analyze to detect
    and classify anomalies, justify findings with threat intelligence context, and propose mitigation steps. Follow with think-pair-share
    on misconceptions like 'High query volume always indicates DGA' or confusing DNS tunneling with DNS amplification.

    always indicates DGA'' → distractor: volume alone diagnostic). 2. Related but incorrect concepts (e.g., confuse tunneling
    with amplification). 3. Partial truths (e.g., tools like Zeek only for logs, ignore rules). Ensure distractors teach via
    explanation.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Topic: DNS Query Anomaly Detection (Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Actor Profiling > 003_Technical Indicator Analysis > Indicators
  of Compromise (IOC) Analysis > DNS Query Anomaly Detection). Use the provided research context on DNS concepts, anomalies
  (tunneling, DGA, exfiltration), tools (Zeek, Suricata), and voter consensus for completeness (C2 communication: attackers
  use DNS for covert channels post-compromise; detection via logs/baselines).
