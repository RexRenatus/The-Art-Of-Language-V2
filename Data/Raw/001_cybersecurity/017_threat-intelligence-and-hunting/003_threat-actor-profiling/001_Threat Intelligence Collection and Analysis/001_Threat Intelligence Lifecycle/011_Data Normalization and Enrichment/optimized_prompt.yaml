active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how inadequate data normalization and enrichment could lead to false negatives
    in threat detection during a simulated APT campaign. Provide real-world examples from sources like MITRE ATT&CK and justify
    your positions with evidence from the threat intelligence lifecycle.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truth (e.g., correct for different context), 3) Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., ''always use ML''). Ensure
    explanations educate on errors, cite STIX spec or research context.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Threat Intelligence. Topic:\
  \ Data Normalization and Enrichment (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Actor Profiling\
  \ > 001_Threat Intelligence 003_Collection and Analysis > 003_Threat Intelligence Lifecycle > Data Normalization and Enrichment).\n\
  \nIncorporate these elements:\n- Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]\n- Scaffolding Layers: [PASTE FULL SCAFFOLDING\
  \ FROM ABOVE, including sources]\n- Research Context: Normalization standardizes raw data (SIEM, feeds) into formats like\
  \ STIX; Enrichment adds geolocation, TTPs, reputation. Complete STIX examples as in Layer 2.\n- Active Learning: Flashcards\
  \ should support activities like discussion on normalization pitfalls, peer teaching STIX, problem-solving raw data exercises.\n\
  \nGenerate 25 flashcards covering all Bloom's levels (prioritize progression: 30% lower, 40% mid, 30% higher) and scaffolding\
  \ layers evenly. Use ONLY the exact schema:\n{\n  \"question\": \"...\",\n  \"correct_answer\": \"...\",\n  \"distractors\"\
  : [\n    {\"text\": \"...\", \"explanation\": \"...\"},\n    {\"text\": \"...\", \"explanation\": \"...\"},\n    {\"text\"\
  : \"...\", \"explanation\": \"...\"}\n  ],\n  \"explanation\": \"...\",\n  \"bloom_level\": \"Remember\",\n  \"scaffolding_layer\"\
  : \"layer1_foundation\"\n}\nOutput as a JSON array of 25 objects. Ensure snake_case, exactly 3 distractors per card with\
  \ educational explanations. Questions assessable, active (e.g., 'Apply normalization to this IP...'). Base on credible sources\
  \ (STIX 2.1, OASIS)."
