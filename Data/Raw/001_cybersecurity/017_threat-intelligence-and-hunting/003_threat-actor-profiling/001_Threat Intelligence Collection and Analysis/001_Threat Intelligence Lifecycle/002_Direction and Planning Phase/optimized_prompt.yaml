active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Direction and Planning can be skipped in mature organizations
    with automated threat hunting tools.'' Use examples from MITRE ATT&CK and recent breaches (e.g., SolarWinds) to support
    arguments, addressing common misconceptions like ''Direction is optional'' or ''Planning ignores iterative feedback.''
    Synthesize group consensus into key takeaways.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for spaced repetition (Anki-compatible). Cover all Bloom''s levels via these
  objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]. Use 4-layer scaffolding: [INSERT scaffolding OBJECT HERE]. Incorporate
  active learning hooks: [INSERT active_learning OBJECT HERE].


  Content foundation: Direction (strategic ''what/why''), Planning (tactical ''how''). Frameworks: MITRE ATT&CK (tactics=why,
  techniques=how, sub-techniques/procedures=granular). Best practices: Define objectives, scope requirements, align stakeholders,
  allocate resources, select methodologies, prioritize risk, set metrics. Address misconceptions (e.g., phases optional).
  Voter priorities: Progressive complexity, measurable outcomes, engagement.


  Follow exact flashcard schema: [INSERT flashcard_schema OBJECT HERE]. Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'',
  ''back'': ''...'', ''blooms_level'': ''...'', ''scaffold_layer'': ''...'', ''type'': ''MCQ/ShortAnswer/Cloze''}]. Ensure
  progressive coverage: 30% Layer1, 25% Layer2, 25% Layer3, 20% Layer4. Balance Bloom''s: 20% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze,
  30% Evaluate, 20% Create. Make engaging, web-grounded (cite CISA/MITRE).'
