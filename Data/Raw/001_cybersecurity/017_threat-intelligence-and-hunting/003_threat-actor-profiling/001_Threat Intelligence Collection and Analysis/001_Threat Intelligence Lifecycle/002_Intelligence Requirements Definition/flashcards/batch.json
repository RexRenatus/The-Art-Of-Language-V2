        {
          "text": "Threat hunting is performed independently of intelligence requirements, focusing solely on technical anomalies.",

          "misconception": "Targets [scope limitation]: While IOCs can be part of hunts, effective hunting also looks for behaviors and TTPs, often guided by broader requirements beyond just IOCs."

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Intelligence requirements provide the strategic direction and hypotheses for threat hunting, ensuring hunts are focused on relevant threats, while the findings from these hunts can reveal new adversary TTPs or gaps, thus informing the refinement or creation of new, more effective intelligence requirements.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The first distractor ignores the intelligence-driven nature of effective hunting. The second reverses the logical flow of requirements guiding hunts. The third limits hunting scope to only IOCs, missing behavioral analysis.",
        "analogy": "Intelligence requirements are the map for a treasure hunt (threat hunting). The map guides the hunters, and if they discover a new clue or obstacle, they update the map for future hunts."
