    - define
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Apply knowledge to scenarios
    verbs:
    - apply
    measurable: true
  analyze:
  - objective: Analyze relationships
    verbs:
    - analyze
    measurable: true
  understand:
  - objective: Explain core concepts
    verbs:
    - explain
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the pros and cons of standardizing threat intelligence data with STIX versus using proprietary
    formats in a TIP. How does this impact interoperability, organizational agility, and threat actor profiling for attribution
    of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert cybersecurity educator and flashcard generator specializing in Threat Intelligence. Generate\
  \ 50 high-quality, spaced-repetition-optimized flashcards for the topic 'TIP Data Management' (Category: Cybersecurity >\
  \ Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Actor Profiling > 001_Threat Intelligence 003_Collection and Analysis > Threat\
  \ Intelligence Platforms and Standards > TIP Data Management). \n\nIncorporate university pedagogy: Cover these exact learning\
  \ objectives across cards - [insert learning_objectives array here]. Distribute evenly: 20% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 30% APPLY/ANALYZE,\
  \ 50% EVALUATE/CREATE. Tag each with blooms_level.\n\nUse 4-layer scaffolding progressively (10-15 cards per layer early\
  \ to late): [insert scaffolding details here]. Tag each with scaffolding_layer.\n\nSupport active learning: 10% cards reference\
  \ discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving (e.g., 'How does this relate to debating STIX vs. proprietary?').\n\nContent\
  \ foundation: TIP aggregates/analyzes threat data (TI: strategic/operational/tactical); IoCs (IPs/hashes); TTPs; STIX 2.1\
  \ (SDOs: Threat Actor/Indicator; SCOs: IPv4-Addr/File; SROs: relationships); TAXII (transport); Lifecycle: ingestion/normalization/deduplication/enrichment/storage/access/retirement;\
  \ Best practices; Role in actor profiling (TTP/IoC mapping); Interoperability.\n\nFollow flashcard schema exactly: [insert\
  \ flashcard_schema here]. Mix formats: 40% MCQ (with distractors), 40% Q/A (recall), 20% cloze-style questions. Ensure atomic\
  \ facts, active recall (e.g., 'What are SDOs?'), no passive reading.\n\nOutput ONLY a JSON array of 50 flashcards: [{'id':1,\
  \ ...}, ...]. No extra text."
