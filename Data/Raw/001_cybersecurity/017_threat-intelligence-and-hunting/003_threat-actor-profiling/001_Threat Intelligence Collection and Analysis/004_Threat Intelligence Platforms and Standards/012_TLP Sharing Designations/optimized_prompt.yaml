active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: You are part of a threat intelligence team that has discovered a zero-day vulnerability exploited by
    a nation-state actor. Debate as a group which TLP designation (RED, AMBER, GREEN, CLEAR) is most appropriate for sharing
    this with your industry peers and allies, considering risks of over-sharing (e.g., alerting adversaries) or under-sharing
    (e.g., missing collaborative defenses), and justify with real-world examples from CISA alerts or vendor reports.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - D1: Common misconception (e.g., confuse TLP:RED with verbal-only sharing).

    - D2: Partial truth/mix-up (e.g., TLP:GREEN rules for AMBER).

    - D3: Extreme opposite (e.g., ''share publicly'' for RED).

    Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter-noted pitfalls (e.g., over-sharing assumptions) and research (e.g., AMBER
    vs. AMBER+STRICT).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Threat Intelligence. Topic:
  ''TLP Sharing Designations'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Actor Profiling > 001_Threat
  Intelligence 003_Collection and Analysis > Threat Intelligence Platforms and Standards > TLP Sharing Designations). Use
  this comprehensive content for generation:


  **Core Content (from FIRST TLP 2.0 + variants):** TLP:RED (no disclosure, immediate exchange only, verbal best); TLP:AMBER
  (share within org on need-to-know); TLP:AMBER+STRICT (org-internal only); TLP:GREEN (share in trusted communities); TLP:CLEAR
  (can publish with attribution). Purpose: Control sharing in threat intel. Examples: CISA (CLEAR), vendors (AMBER). Implementation:
  Assess > Choose > Mark > Share.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full array from above].

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full scaffolding from above].

  **Active Learning:** [Insert summaries: discussion on zero-day, peer teaching analogies, problem-solving classification].


  Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards (10-15 per Bloom''s level where possible, distributed across layers). Optimize for
  Anki/Spaced Repetition: Varied types (40% basic/cloze, 60% MCQ for testing). Ensure progressive difficulty (Layer 1 simple
  recall, Layer 4 scenario-based). Incorporate voter priorities: Real-world scenarios, misconceptions, policy design.


  **Output ONLY a valid JSON array of flashcard objects matching this exact schema:** [Insert full flashcard_schema structure
  verbatim]. No extra text.'
