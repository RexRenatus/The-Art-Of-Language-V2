        "core_logic": "The execution of PowerShell scripts, especially from unusual processes, directly aligns with the 'Execution' tactic because it represents the adversary's action of running code on a system. This works by using the ATT&CK framework to categorize observed behaviors, linking the anomalous script execution to the goal of running code.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Persistence relates to maintaining access. Discovery relates to gathering information. Command and Control relates to communication. While PowerShell can be used for all these, the act of running the script itself is primarily an 'Execution' technique.",
