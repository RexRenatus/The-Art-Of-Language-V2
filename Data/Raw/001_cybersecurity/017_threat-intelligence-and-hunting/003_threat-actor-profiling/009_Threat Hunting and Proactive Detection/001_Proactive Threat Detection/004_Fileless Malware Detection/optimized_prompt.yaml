active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare fileless malware techniques like Living off the Land (LotL) with traditional file-based attacks.
    Debate whether behavioral analysis or memory forensics is more effective for detection in enterprise environments, using
    real-world examples such as PowerShell abuse or WMI exploitation. Support your arguments with evidence from EDR tools
    or hunting frameworks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    terms (e.g., WMI vs. PowerShell); 3) Outdated methods (signature-based as ''best''); 4) Voter-suggested misconceptions
    (e.g., ignoring behavioral over signatures). Ensure plausibility for active recall testing.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Fileless Malware Detection
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat Actor Profiling > 011_009_Threat Hunting and
  Proactive Detection > Proactive Threat Detection > Fileless Malware Detection). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy,
  active learning, 4-layer scaffolding.


  **Content to Use:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list from above]

  - Active Learning: Incorporate elements into explanations (e.g., link to discussion debates).

  - Scaffolding: Layer 1 [full text]; Layer 2 [full]; Layer 3 [full]; Layer 4 [full]. Prior Knowledge: [full].

  - Research Context: Fileless malware executes in memory using LotL (PowerShell, WMI, etc.), evades AV. Detection: Behavioral
  analysis (API calls, process injection), EDR/XDR, Sysmon/Sigma queries, ML. Sources: SentinelOne, Microsoft, ReliaQuest.


  **Task:** Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following the exact schema:

  {front: "Question", back: {answer: "...", explanation: "... (tie to Bloom''s, example, active learning link, source)", distractors:
  ["A", "B", "C"] (if MCQ), references: ["source1"]}}. Mix formats; balance layers/Bloom''s; distractors per protocol. Output
  as numbered JSON array for Anki import. Voter priorities: Pedagogy (Bloom''s/scaffolding), completeness (behavioral tools/queries).'
