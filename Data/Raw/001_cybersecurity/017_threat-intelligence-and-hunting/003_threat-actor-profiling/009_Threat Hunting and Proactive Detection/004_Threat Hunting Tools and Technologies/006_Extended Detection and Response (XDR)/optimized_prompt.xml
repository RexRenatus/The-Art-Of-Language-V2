    <objective level="remember" measurable="true">Recall the definition of Extended Detection and Response (XDR) and list its core components (e.g., data ingestion, correlation engine, AI/ML analytics, automated response).</objective>
    <objective level="remember" measurable="true">Identify key prerequisite concepts such as EDR, SIEM, and SOAR, and their relationship to XDR.</objective>
    <objective level="understand" measurable="true">Explain how XDR unifies telemetry from endpoints, networks, cloud, email, and applications to break down security silos.</objective>
    <objective level="understand" measurable="true">Describe the process of data correlation and AI/ML-driven analysis in XDR for threat detection.</objective>
    <objective level="apply" measurable="true">Apply XDR principles to outline how it correlates telemetry in a supply chain attack scenario (e.g., SolarWinds), mapping to MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques.</objective>
    <objective level="analyze" measurable="true">Analyze the interactions between XDR components (e.g., data ingestion → correlation → response) and compare XDR with EDR/SIEM in terms of visibility and complexity.</objective>
    <objective level="evaluate" measurable="true">Evaluate the benefits (e.g., unified visibility, faster response) and limitations (e.g., implementation complexity, vendor lock-in) of XDR for different organizational sizes.</objective>

    <system_prompt>You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on 'Extended Detection and Response (XDR)' in the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity &gt; Threat Intelligence And Hunting &gt; Threat Actor Profiling &gt; 011_009_Threat Hunting and Proactive Detection &gt; 011_004_Threat Hunting Tools and Technologies &gt; XDR.
Incorporate these pedagogical elements:
- Learning objectives by Bloom's Taxonomy: [insert full learning_objectives JSON here].
- Active learning context: Use discussion/comparison prompts, peer teaching on components, problem-solving for scenarios like SolarWinds.
- Scaffolding: Strictly base content on 4 layers: [insert full scaffolding JSON here]. Include concept map (XDR → Data Ingestion → Correlation/Analysis → Automated Response → Threat Hunting, linked to MITRE ATT&amp;CK/EDR/SIEM/SOAR).
- Research context: XDR unifies tools across layers for end-to-end visibility (IBM/Microsoft); core: data correlation, AI/ML, automation; benefits: breaks silos, faster response; limitations: complexity (Trend Micro).
- Prior knowledge: Connect to EDR (endpoints), SIEM (logs), SOAR (automation).
Follow this schema exactly [insert full flashcard_schema JSON here].
Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards. Ensure variety: 30% MCQs with distractors, 20% scenarios/applications, balance across levels/layers. Make explanations educational, tying to objectives/activities (e.g., 'This supports analysis objective by...'). Use action verbs and measurable phrasing.</system_prompt>
