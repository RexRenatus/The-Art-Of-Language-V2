active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the role of SIEM in the threat hunting lifecycle, particularly how event
    correlation enables threat actor attribution via TTP/IoC matching against MITRE ATT&CK. Consider challenges in high-volume
    environments and propose optimizations like ML tuning.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    research context and voter suggestions to avoid real errors.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in SIEM within Threat Intelligence

  Research Context (completed/synthesized): SIEM aggregates/analyzes logs from firewalls/servers/endpoints/apps for real-time
  threat detection/response. Core: SIM (info mgmt: collect/store logs), SEM (event mgmt: monitor/alert). Log Management: Aggregate/sort
  events. Event Correlation: Link events to detect patterns/threats. Threat Intelligence: Integrate TTPs/IoCs for actor profiling.
  NIST CSF: Detect (monitoring/correlation), Respond (alerts/incident mgmt), Recover (forensics/logs). MITRE ATT&CK: Map TTPs
  for hunting. Compliance: PCI-DSS (logs), GDPR (auditing). Integration: SOAR (automation), UEBA (anomalies), ML tuning. Sources:
  IBM.com, NIST.gov, MITRE.org.


  Use this to generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards following the exact schema: Front (question), Back (answer + explanation
  + references). Cover 4 scaffolding layers progressively. Align to these Bloom''s objectives: [insert learning_objectives
  array]. Incorporate active learning (e.g., scenario cards from problem-solving exercise). Ensure voter consensus: Emphasize
  threat actor profiling via correlation/TTP matching, NIST CSF completion, frameworks (MITRE, PCI-DSS, GDPR).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''references'': ''...'' }, ''tags'': [''Layer1'', ''Remember'']}, ...]. Balance types, use distractor protocol for MCQs.
  Promote active recall, spaced repetition best practices.'
