learning_objectives:
  analyze:
  - objective: Analyze the interactions between XDR components (e.g., data ingestion → correlation → response) and compare
      XDR with EDR/SIEM in terms of visibility and complexity.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  create:
  - objective: Design a step-by-step XDR implementation plan for a hypothetical mid-sized enterprise, including tool integration
      and threat hunting workflows.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  understand:
  - objective: Explain how XDR unifies telemetry from endpoints, networks, cloud, email, and applications to break down security
      silos.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  - objective: Describe the process of data correlation and AI/ML-driven analysis in XDR for threat detection.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Apply XDR principles to outline how it correlates telemetry in a supply chain attack scenario (e.g., SolarWinds),
      mapping to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  remember:
  - objective: Recall the definition of Extended Detection and Response (XDR) and list its core components (e.g., data ingestion,
      correlation engine, AI/ML analytics, automated response).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  - objective: Identify key prerequisite concepts such as EDR, SIEM, and SOAR, and their relationship to XDR.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  evaluate:
  - objective: Evaluate the benefits (e.g., unified visibility, faster response) and limitations (e.g., implementation complexity,
      vendor lock-in) of XDR for different organizational sizes.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'Compare XDR with EDR and SIEM: In what scenarios does XDR provide superior threat visibility (e.g.,
    cross-domain attacks), and what are potential drawbacks in implementation (e.g., integration challenges, higher costs)?
    Debate with evidence from real-world examples like SolarWinds.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

      Ensure distractors are realistic from research context (e.g., silo issues) and teach via explanation.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on
  ''Extended Detection and Response (XDR)'' in the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning objectives by Bloom''s Taxonomy: [insert full learning_objectives JSON here].

  - Active learning context: Use discussion/comparison prompts, peer teaching on components, problem-solving for scenarios
  like SolarWinds.

  - Scaffolding: Strictly base content on 4 layers: [insert full scaffolding JSON here]. Include concept map (XDR → Data Ingestion
  → Correlation/Analysis → Automated Response → Threat Hunting, linked to MITRE ATT&CK/EDR/SIEM/SOAR).

  - Research context: XDR unifies tools across layers for end-to-end visibility (IBM/Microsoft); core: data correlation, AI/ML,
  automation; benefits: breaks silos, faster response; limitations: complexity (Trend Micro).

  - Prior knowledge: Connect to EDR (endpoints), SIEM (logs), SOAR (automation).


  Follow this schema exactly [insert full flashcard_schema JSON here].

  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards. Ensure variety: 30% MCQs with distractors, 20% scenarios/applications, balance across
  levels/layers. Make explanations educational, tying to objectives/activities (e.g., ''This supports analysis objective by...'').
  Use action verbs and measurable phrasing.'
