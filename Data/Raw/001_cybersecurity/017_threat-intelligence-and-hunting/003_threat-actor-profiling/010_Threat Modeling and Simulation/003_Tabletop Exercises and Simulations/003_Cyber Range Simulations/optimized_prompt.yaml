active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss common student misconceptions about cyber range simulations (e.g., 'they are just video games
    rather than realistic training replicas') and provide non-examples (tabletop exercises) versus examples (DoD cyber ranges
    with VM-based threat injection). How do they enhance threat hunting over traditional methods?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., ''Cyber ranges use physical hardware''), 2) Partial truth/confusion (e.g., mix tabletop with cyber range), 3) Plausible
    unrelated (e.g., NIST framework swapped with MITRE). Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter-noted misconceptions
    and research.'

  Incorporate these EXACTLY:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the full learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: Use for context in explanations (e.g., tie to discussion misconceptions).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards evenly: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4. Cover all content points.

  - Prior Knowledge/Misconceptions: Weave in (e.g., build on tabletop; not ''just games'').

  - Sources: NIST.gov/document/cyber-range, MITRE.org/attack, NIST NICE Framework.


  Generate flashcards per EXACT schema: [paste full flashcard_schema here].


  Best Practices: High-yield for Anki/Quizlet (active recall, spaced repetition). Varied types: 30% Q&A, 40% MCQ (with distractors),
  30% Cloze. Balance: Even across 6 objectives, 4 layers. Ensure university pedagogy: Scaffolded, measurable. Output ONLY
  valid JSON array of flashcards, no extra text.'
