active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a scenario where a company uses a cloud-based database, identify potential TTPs from external adversaries
    (e.g., Reconnaissance via MITRE ATT&CK) and debate the most effective countermeasures from the MAE Catalog. Consider trade-offs
    in cost, implementation time, effectiveness, and alignment with NIST SP 800-39 risk management principles.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Context and Sources:**

  - TARA: Engineering methodology for identifying/assessing cyber threats via CTSA (susceptibility to TTPs → Threat Matrix)
  and CRRA (countermeasures). Uses MAE Catalog for TTPs/CMs.

  - TTPs: Adversary steps (cyber/EW/supply chain/social; objectives: Recon/Penetration/etc.).

  - Sources: MITRE ATT&CK (TTPs), NIST SP 800-39 (risk mgmt via threat events), MITRE SSE/TARA docs.

  - Prior Knowledge: Threat modeling (STRIDE), basic risk assessment.

  - Big Picture: TARA enables predictive defense in threat lifecycle.


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full learning_objectives array here].

  - Scaffolding: Generate flashcards strictly layered [Insert full scaffolding array here].

  - Active Learning: Incorporate elements from discussion/prompts/exercises into advanced cards (e.g., scenario-based Qs on
  SolarWinds/cloud DB).


  **Generation Rules:**

  - Cover topic hierarchy fully.

  - Balance: 10 flashcards/layer, span Bloom''s levels.

  - Schema: [Insert full flashcard_schema here].

  - Ensure active recall: Questions test application/analysis (avoid pure lookup).

  - Explanations: 2-4 sentences, reference objectives/layers/sources, link to real-world (e.g., SolarWinds).


  **Output Format:** JSON array of objects: [{''type'': ''Q&A|MCQ'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...''}]. No additional
  text.'
