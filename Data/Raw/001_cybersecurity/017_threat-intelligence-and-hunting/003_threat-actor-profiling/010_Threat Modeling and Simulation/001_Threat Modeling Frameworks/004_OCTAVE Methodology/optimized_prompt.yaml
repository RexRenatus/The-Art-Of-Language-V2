  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of OCTAVE''s self-directed team approach versus consultant-led
    methods. How does its asset-driven focus improve upon generic vulnerability scanning? Link to prior knowledge: Recall
    how asset classification from intro cybersecurity (e.g., CIA triad) supports this.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
