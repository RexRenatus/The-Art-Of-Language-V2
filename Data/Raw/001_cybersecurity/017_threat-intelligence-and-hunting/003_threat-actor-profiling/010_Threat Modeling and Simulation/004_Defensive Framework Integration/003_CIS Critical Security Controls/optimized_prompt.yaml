active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs between implementing CIS Controls IG1 versus IG3 for a small business versus
    a large enterprise. Which controls provide the best return on investment for defending against real-world threats like
    ransomware, and why? Support your argument with examples from recent breaches such as SolarWinds or Colonial Pipeline.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    of CIS). Ensure distractors test subtle differences in threat intel contexts.'
