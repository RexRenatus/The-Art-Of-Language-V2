active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how disrupting the Weaponization phase (e.g., via intelligence on custom
    malware tools) impacts overall threat hunting success. Use examples from Emotet or APT campaigns to support arguments,
    addressing misconceptions like equating weaponization with initial delivery.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
