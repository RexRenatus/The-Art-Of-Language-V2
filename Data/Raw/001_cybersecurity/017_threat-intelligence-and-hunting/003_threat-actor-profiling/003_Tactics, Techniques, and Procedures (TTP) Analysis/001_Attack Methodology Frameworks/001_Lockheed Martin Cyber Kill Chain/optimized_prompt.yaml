active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, assign each partner 3-4 stages of the Kill Chain. One explains the stage (adversary actions, defenses,
    real example vs. non-example like phishing as delivery but non-weaponized), then the partner teaches it back and quizzes
    with a scenario. Switch roles.
  problem_solving: In groups, analyze a real breach (e.g., Colonial Pipeline ransomware). Map the attack to Kill Chain stages,
    identify missed disruption points, and design layered defenses. Present findings and peer-review for completeness.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., confuse Delivery
    with Weaponization); 2) Adjacent stages (e.g., Exploitation vs. Installation); 3) Real-world mix-ups (e.g., MITRE tactics
    as Kill Chain stages); 4) Outdated/incorrect defenses (e.g., ''firewalls only'' for C2). Ensure distractors are 70% plausible
    to challenge but not trick.'
