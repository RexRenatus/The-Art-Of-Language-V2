active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare the Infrastructure vertex in state-sponsored (e.g., APT28 C2 infra) vs. cybercrime attacks—how
    does it influence attribution? Use MITRE ATT&CK examples and discuss countermeasures.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student teaches the other about Infrastructure components (e.g., C2 servers vs. compromised
    systems) using hand-drawn diagrams; switch roles and provide feedback.
  problem_solving: Given a set of IOCs (e.g., suspicious IPs/domains from a phishing campaign), students use simulated tools
    (WHOIS, Passive DNS) to map them to the Diamond Model, hunt relationships, and hypothesize threat actor TTPs.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Threat Intelligence and
  Hunting. Topic: ''Diamond Model Infrastructure Vertex'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Threat Intelligence And Hunting > Threat
  Actor Profiling > 004_Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) Analysis > Attack Methodology Frameworks > Diamond Model
  Infrastructure Vertex).


  Core Content (Web Research): Infrastructure vertex = adversary resources (C2 servers, malware points, compromised systems,
  domains/IPs, channels). Frameworks: MITRE ATT&CK (e.g., TA0011 C2). Sources: Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis (Caltagirone,
  P., Pendergast, A., & Betz, C., 2013); MITRE ATT&CK (https://attack.mitre.org); RFCs (e.g., relevant protocols like DNS
  for infra analysis).


  Prior Knowledge: Builds on Diamond Model intro and TTPs.


  Learning Objectives (Bloom''s): [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE].


  Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL 4 LAYERS FROM ABOVE]. Progress flashcards from Layer 1 to 4.


  Active Learning Integration: Tie explanations to activities [INSERT SUMMARY: discussion on attribution, peer teaching diagrams,
  IOC problem-solving, think-pair-share misconceptions].


  Connection Mapping: Prerequisites (Diamond vertices, TTPs); Related (MITRE infra); Cross-domain (forensics); Real-world
  (APT28); Mastery (profiling pivots).


  Generate a deck of 50 flashcards following EXACT schema: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD_SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Output as JSON array
  of objects. Ensure high-quality: spaced repetition optimized (active recall), measurable (SMART objectives), engaging (hooks
  to activities). No duplicates; vary difficulty.'
