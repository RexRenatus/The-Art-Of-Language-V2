active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of Pre-OS versus Post-OS persistence techniques for APTs.
    Consider factors like detection risk, implementation complexity, and evasion of EDR tools. Support arguments with MITRE
    ATT&CK examples and real-world cases like SolarWinds.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet. Output as a JSON array of objects, each matching the schema
  (front, back with subfields). Vary question types. Ensure pedagogical depth: explanations tie to Bloom''s, layers, and hunting
  practicality. Prioritize voter consensus: full persistence taxonomy, detection steps, lifecycle integration.'
