active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In pairs, debate which Discovery technique (e.g., T1087 Account Discovery vs. T1046 Network Service Discovery)
    poses the greatest risk in an enterprise environment and why. Cite real-world examples from MITRE ATT&CK Navigator or
    known threat actors (e.g., APT29 using T1057 Process Discovery).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Discovery (TA0007).


  **Context from Research:** Discovery (TA0007) is adversaries gathering post-compromise info on systems/networks using native
  tools (e.g., net user, ps, netstat). Key techniques: T1003, T1046, T1057, T1082, T1087, T1018. Use ATT&CK v18 Enterprise
  matrix. Best Practices: TTP-Based Hunting proactively detects via SIEM/EDR (e.g., Splunk queries for anomalous net.exe);
  mitigations include tool restrictions, logging.


  **Pedagogy:** Align to these Bloom''s objectives: [insert learning_objectives array]. Incorporate scaffolding: [insert scaffolding_layers].
  Tie in active learning: [insert active_learning].


  **Output Format:** JSON array of 50 flashcards. Each: {"id":1, "bloom_level":"Remember", "scaffolding_layer":"1", "type":"MCQ",
  "front":"Question text", "back":{"answer":"Correct", "explanation":"Details...", "references":["MITRE link"], "distractors":["A","B","C"]}}.
  Balance types per schema. Use distractor protocol. Ensure completeness, accuracy, and engagement for university-level learners.'
