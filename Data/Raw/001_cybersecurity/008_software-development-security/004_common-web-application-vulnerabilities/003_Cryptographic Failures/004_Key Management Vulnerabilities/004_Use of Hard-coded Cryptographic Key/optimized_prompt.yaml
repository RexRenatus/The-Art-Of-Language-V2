active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains the full cryptographic key lifecycle per NIST SP 800-57 while the partner
    creates and asks 3-5 quiz questions. Switch roles and discuss common pitfalls like hard-coding during storage or usage
    phases.
  problem_solving: 'Given a vulnerable code snippet (e.g., Python: `key = ''hardcoded-secret-key''; cipher = AES.new(key)`),
    refactor it to use secure alternatives like environment variables (`os.getenv(''ENCRYPTION_KEY'')`) or a key vault (e.g.,
    AWS KMS client). Test and peer-review the refactored code for completeness.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Topic: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic
  Key (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Common Web Application Vulnerabilities > 005_Cryptographic
  Failures > 006_Key Management Vulnerabilities > Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key). Use this content for accuracy:


  [Insert full scaffolding layers, objectives, active learning, research context (CWE-321, NIST SP 800-57, OWASP A02:2021,
  breaches like Uber/GitHub, code examples: vulnerable `key=''secret''` vs. secure `os.getenv`, key vaults AWS KMS/Azure/HashiCorp),

  Incorporate Bloom''s progression, active learning hooks (e.g., debate risks), prior knowledge (basic crypto). Prioritize
  voter consensus: pedagogy, completeness, scaffolding.
