active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios might anonymous key exchange be intentionally used (e.g., privacy-focused messaging
    apps), and what mitigations would you recommend to balance anonymity with security? Debate the pros and cons in groups,
    considering trade-offs like MITM vulnerability versus user privacy.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

      is inherent)'
    - 'Partial truths: e.g., Correct DH steps but wrong shared secret computation'
    - 'Confused primitives: Mix DLP with IFC or DH with RSA'
    - 'Real-world errors: Reference early SSL vulnerabilities as ''secure'' distractors'
    - 'Edge cases: Scenarios where anonymity seems safe but isn''t (e.g., no MITM threat)'
    balance: 1-2 distractors per card from voter priorities (e.g., incomplete crypto knowledge), ensure 25% scenario-based
