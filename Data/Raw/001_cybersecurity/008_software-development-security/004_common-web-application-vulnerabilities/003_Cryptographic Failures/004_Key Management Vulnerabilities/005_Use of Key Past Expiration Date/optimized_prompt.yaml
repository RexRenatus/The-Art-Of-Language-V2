  discussion_prompt: 'Debate: Under what circumstances, if any, is it justifiable to continue using a cryptographic key past
    its expiration date in a live system? Consider trade-offs between security risks (e.g., prolonged exposure to compromise
    per NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 Rev. 5 and Part 2 Rev. 1) and operational costs such as downtime or re-issuance efforts. Support
    arguments with real-world examples from OWASP Top 10.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    secure if not compromised''); 2) Partial truths (e.g., ''Rotation only needed yearly''); 3) Related but incorrect concepts
    (e.g., confuse expiration with revocation); 4) Edge cases (e.g., ''Justifiable in offline systems''). Ensure distractors
    are realistic from voter consensus errors or OWASP pitfalls.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Software Development Security
  under OWASP/ NIST frameworks. Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Common Web Application Vulnerabilities
  > 005_Cryptographic Failures > 006_Key Management Vulnerabilities > Use of Key Past Expiration Date.


  Generate 30 high-quality Anki-style flashcards (10 per Bloom''s lower/middle/upper levels) optimized for spaced repetition.
  Incorporate these exact elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving to inspire scenario-based cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers (Foundation: 8 cards; Components: 8; Implementation: 7; Integration: 7).

  - Schema: Front (question + MCQ if apply); Back (answer, explanation, tags). Follow distractor protocol exactly.


  Content Sources: NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 Rev. 5 (key lifecycle, expiry limits exposure); Part 2 Rev. 1 (rotation best practices);
  OWASP A02:2021; definitions (key, expiration, compromise); code examples; related concepts (rotation, revocation).


  Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''tags'': [''...'']},
  ''layer'': ''1'', ''bloom_level'': ''REMEMBER''}, ...]. Ensure variety: 40% recall, 30% apply/analyze, 30% evaluate/create.
  Make measurable and active (e.g., ''Identify in this code...'').'
