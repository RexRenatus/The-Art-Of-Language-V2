active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, analyze how improper signature verification contributed to real-world attacks
    like the Flame malware (which forged Microsoft signatures). Debate the impact on the CIA triad (focus on integrity and
    authenticity) and propose mitigations aligned with OWASP Top 10 A02:2021 Cryptographic Failures. Use analogies like comparing
    digital signatures to handwritten ones on checks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the 6 objectives above].

  - Prior Knowledge: Public-key crypto, RSA/ECDSA signatures, hashing.

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste the 4 layers descriptions].

  - Active Learning Hooks: Tie flashcards to discussions (e.g., Flame malware), peer-teaching (steps), problem-solving (code
  fixes).

  - Big Picture: OWASP A02:2021, NIST SP 800-57 (key mgmt), CIA impacts, secure SDLC.

  - Sources: CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature), NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 (Recommendations for Key Management),
