  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the scenarios where .NET impersonation is truly necessary (e.g., legacy
    file access) versus where it introduces undue risk compared to modern alternatives like Windows Identity Foundation or
    least-privilege service accounts. Reference OWASP A05: Security Misconfiguration and provide real-world examples from
    breaches.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Distractors must be plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Impersonation always uses app pool identity' vs.
      correct 'client token').
    - 'Draw from research context: Mix up purpose (bypass auth) with delegation; confuse IIS with Apache; partial best practices
      (e.g., ''Enable impersonation for all apps'').'
    - 1 semi-correct (close but incomplete), 1 opposite (e.g., 'No risks'), 1 unrelated (e.g., SQL injection).
    - Ensure 20-30% flashcards per scaffolding layer; balance Bloom's levels.
    quantity: Generate 50-75 flashcards total, categorized by layer/objective.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Software Development Security.
  Topic: .NET Misconfiguration Use of Impersonation (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Common Web
  Application Vulnerabilities > 009_Security Misconfiguration > Environment and Deployment Misconfigurations > .NET Misconfiguration
  Use of Impersonation). Use provided research: Impersonation = server runs as client via IIS token; risks = escalation (CWE-520);
  best practices = disable default, least-priv pools, audit, constrained delegation. Include code snippets, concept map (CWE-520
  central → Risks/Mechanisms/Mitigations → OWASP/NIST).


  Incorporate pedagogy:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL 4 LAYERS FROM ABOVE]


  Generate 50-75 flashcards following EXACT schema:

  Front: Question (specify Bloom''s level/layer) + 4 MC options (1 correct, 3 distractors per protocol).

  Back: Correct answer + explanation (code, risks, mitigations, refs) + Bloom''s/layer + activity tie-in + hierarchy.


  Distractors: Plausible misconceptions only. Balance: 25% per layer, span all objectives. Ensure university-level rigor,
  active learning prompts, voter consensus (completeness on best practices/sources: CWE-520 https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/520.html,
  OWASP A05). Output as JSON array of flashcards.'
