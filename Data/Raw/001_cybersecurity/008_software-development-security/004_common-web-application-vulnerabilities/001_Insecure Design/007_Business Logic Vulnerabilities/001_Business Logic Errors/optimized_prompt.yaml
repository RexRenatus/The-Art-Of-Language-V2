active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what ways do business logic errors differ from technical vulnerabilities like SQL injection (CWE-89)?
    Debate whether developers or business analysts should primarily own their prevention, using OWASP examples to support
    arguments. Consider prerequisites like authentication flaws.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards
  on ''Business Logic Errors'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Common Web Application Vulnerabilities
  > 003_Insecure Design > Business Logic Vulnerabilities > Business Logic Errors). Use the provided learning objectives, active
  learning components, 4-layer scaffolding, and research context (CWE-840: flaws enabling manipulation of app logic; OWASP

  Emphasize differences from technical vulns, business domain dependency, devastating impacts.


  Incorporate pedagogy: Bloom''s progression, active learning (e.g., reference discussion on dev vs. analyst ownership, e-comm
  problem-solving), scaffolding layers, prerequisites (SQLi, auth flaws), concept map.


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"type": "Q&A|MCQ|Application", "front": "...", "back": "...", "layer":
  1-4, "bloom": "REMEMBER|UNDERSTAND|APPLY|ANALYZE|EVALUATE|CREATE", "explanation": "Detailed rationale + misconception +
