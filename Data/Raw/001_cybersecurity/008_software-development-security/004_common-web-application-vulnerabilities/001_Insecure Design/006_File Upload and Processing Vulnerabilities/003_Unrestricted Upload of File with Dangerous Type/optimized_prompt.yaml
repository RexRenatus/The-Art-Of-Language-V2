  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''File extension whitelisting alone is sufficient to prevent
    unrestricted file uploads with dangerous types.'' Support your position with references to CWE-434 and OWASP guidelines,
    and propose hybrid mitigations.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions: 1) Over-reliance on client-side
    validation or extensions only. 2) Blacklisting instead of whitelisting. 3) Ignoring content/MIME checks (e.g., ''File
    size limits prevent exploits''). Ensure distractors are realistic (50% learner error rate) but clearly wrong per OWASP/CWE.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in 'Unrestricted Upload of\
