active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a web application that dynamically loads third-party DLLs for image processing, debate the trade-offs
    between using default LoadLibrary (flexible but risky) versus explicit paths or signed libraries (secure but rigid). How
    does this impact deployment in cloud environments? Support with examples from MITRE ATT&CK.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
