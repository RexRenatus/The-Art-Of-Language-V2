active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the real-world impact of UAF in web applications (e.g., browser engines
    like Chrome's V8 or WebAssembly sandboxes). How does it relate to OWASP 'Using Freed Memory' and CWE-416? Provide evidence
    from CVEs (e.g., CVE-2021-30554 in Chrome) and propose one prevention strategy for web contexts.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 30-40 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet. Cover all layers/Bloom levels proportionally. Use C/C++
  code examples, real CVEs (e.g., CVE-2021-30554), mitigations (smart pointers, sanitizers), OWASP/CWE-416.


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards, each: {"front": "Question", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...",
  "bloom_level": "REMEMBER", "scaffolding_layer": "1", "type": "MCQ", "options": ["A", "B (correct)", "C", "D"]}}.


  Incorporate prior knowledge (pointers/malloc from intro C++). Ensure measurable, hands-on (code spotting). Distractors per
  protocol: misconceptions like double-free/null errors. Explanations reference research/voters (82.9% consensus).'
