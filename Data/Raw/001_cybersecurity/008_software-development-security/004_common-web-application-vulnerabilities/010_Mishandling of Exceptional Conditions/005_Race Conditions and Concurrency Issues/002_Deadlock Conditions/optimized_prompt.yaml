active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of web applications, which of the four Coffman conditions for deadlock is most challenging
    to mitigate, and why? Debate prevention strategies like lock ordering versus timeouts, using examples from database transactions.
    Consider how deadlocks can enable DoS attacks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors for MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Deadlock requires only 2 conditions''
    instead of 4), 2) Partial truth (e.g., ''Mutual exclusion alone prevents deadlock''), 3) Related but wrong concept (e.g.,
    race condition symptom like data corruption). Base on research: confuse blocking with deadlock, omit circular wait, mix
    with victim selection.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 30 high-quality flashcards on
  ''Deadlock Conditions'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Common Web Application Vulnerabilities
  > 007_Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions > Race Conditions and Concurrency Issues > Deadlock Conditions). Cover all Bloom''s
  levels via these objectives: [insert learning_objectives array]. Use 4-layer scaffolding: [insert scaffolding_layers array
  summaries]. Incorporate active learning contexts (discussion/peer/problem-solving) for realism. Prerequisites: Basic threads/mutexes/race
  conditions.


  Output exactly 30 flashcards as JSON array of objects matching this schema: [insert flashcard_schema.structure]. Ensure
  40% QA/Cloze, 40% MCQ (with distractors per protocol), 20% diagram_label. Distribute: 20% Layer1, 25% Layer2, 25% Layer3,
  30% Layer4; even Bloom''s coverage. Varied difficulty. Front promotes active recall. Explanations pedagogical, tying to
  DoS/security/big picture. Sources: Microsoft SQL Deadlocks Guide, CWE.mitre.org. No duplicates; optimize for Anki/spaced
  repetition.'
