  Topic: ''Allocation of Resources Without Limits'' (CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling), Category:
  Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Common Web Application Vulnerabilities > 007_Mishandling of Exceptional
  Conditions > Resource Exhaustion and DoS > Allocation of Resources Without Limits.


  Core content: Use the provided scaffolding layers, learning objectives (spanning Bloom''s Taxonomy: Remember, Understand,
  Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create), active learning ideas, and sources (CWE-770: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html;
  OWASP ReDoS/HashDoS: https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regex_Denial_of_Service_ReDoS; NIST SP 800-218 SSDF: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-218
  (PO.4, PR.5); NIST CSF 2.0). Emphasize real-world examples (regex DoS, HashDoS, unbounded recursion, ZIP slip), prerequisites
  (basic DoS), and secure practices (quotas, timeouts, rate limiting).


  Incorporate active learning hooks: e.g., cards prompting debate trade-offs or code analysis.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following the exact schema: 40% Basic Q&A, 40% MCQ (with distractor protocol: plausible
  misconceptions like ''limits hurt performance only'', edge cases, similar CWEs), 20% Fill-in/Code. Balance: Layers 1-4 evenly;
  Bloom''s as specified.


  Output as JSON array of objects, each with ''type'', ''front'', ''back'' (nested as schema). Ensure pedagogical progression:
  foundation cards first, integration last. Cards must be concise (front <100 words), explanations educational (200 words
  max, with sources). No hallucinations—ground in provided context.'
