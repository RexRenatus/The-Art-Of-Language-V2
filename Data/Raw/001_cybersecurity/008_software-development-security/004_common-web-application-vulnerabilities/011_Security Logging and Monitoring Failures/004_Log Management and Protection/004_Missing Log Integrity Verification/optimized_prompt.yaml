active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: 'Pair up: Student A explains log integrity mechanisms (e.g., digital signatures, hash chains, HMAC); Student
    B teaches back with a simple diagram, then switch roles.'
  problem_solving: Design a Python script for an append-only logger that verifies integrity using HMAC. Test by simulating
    tampering (e.g., modify a log entry and check verification failure).

  **Full Research Context (Complete OWASP/NIST):** Missing Log Integrity Verification allows attackers to tamper/delete logs
  (e.g., MITRE T1070.001), evading detection. Core: Log Data (event records [NIST]); Log Management (full lifecycle [SP 800-92]);
  Integrity Verification (crypto checks). Risks: Cover tracks in breaches. Best Practices: HMAC/SHA-256 per entry, hash chains,
  digital sigs (ECDSA), append-only/WORM storage, forward-secure logs. OWASP Logging Cheat Sheet (https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Logging_Cheat_Sheet.html):
  Protect logs from tampering via MACs/digital sigs/write-once media; app logs must be trustworthy. NIST SP 800-92 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-92.pdf):
  Secure generation/transmission/storage. NIST 800-53 AU-9 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final): Integrity
  controls for audit records.
