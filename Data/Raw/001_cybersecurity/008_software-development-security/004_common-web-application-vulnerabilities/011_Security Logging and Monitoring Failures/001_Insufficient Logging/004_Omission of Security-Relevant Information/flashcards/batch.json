        "core_logic": "Improper output neutralization allows attackers to inject malicious commands or scripts into log entries (CWE-117), which can be executed by log viewers or lead to XSS if logs are displayed insecurely, compromising integrity and security.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly suggest crashes, encryption, or performance improvements, failing to grasp the core risk of log injection and its consequences like XSS.",
        "analogy": "It's like allowing someone to write freely in a guest book without checking their entries, potentially allowing them to add harmful messages or links."
