active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios is reflection necessary despite its inherent risks (e.g., dynamic plugin loading in
    Java frameworks), and what mitigations (e.g., whitelisting classes/methods, SecurityManager in Java) can make it safe?
    Debate trade-offs with real-world examples from Java or C#, addressing common misconceptions that reflection is always
    unsafe.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - D1: Common misconception (e.g., confuse reflection with SQL injection).

    - D2: Partial truth (e.g., safe practice misapplied).

    - D3: Edge case or unrelated vuln (e.g., XSS instead of RCE).

    Ensure distractors teach by reinforcing why wrong (mentioned in explanation). Base on voter priorities (e.g., risks, mitigations)
    and research (classpath, RCE).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Unsafe Reflection (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Common Web Application Vulnerabilities > 001_Injection Vulnerabilities
  > Input Validation and Resource Injection > Unsafe Reflection). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning,
  4-layer scaffolding.


  CONTENT CONTEXT:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full array from ''learning_objectives'']

  - Active Learning: [insert full object from ''active_learning'']

  - Scaffolding: [insert full object from ''scaffolding'']

  - Prior Knowledge: Basic reflection (java.lang.reflect), prior injections (SQL/Command).

  - Big Picture: OWASP A03:2021 Injection variant; prevents RCE in web apps/SDLC.

  - Key Facts: Reflection risks (classpath manip, security bypass, RCE); Mitigations (whitelists, sanitization, avoid in sec
  paths); Examples in Java/C#.

  - Sources: OWASP Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet, Java SecurityManager Docs, PortSwigger Labs, NIST SP 800-95.


  TASK: Generate 40 high-quality flashcards covering all objectives (6-7 per), layers (10 per), and active elements (e.g.,
  exploit PoCs, debate trade-offs). Follow exact Flashcard Schema:

  [insert full ''flashcard_schema'']


  Output ONLY a JSON array: [{''id'':1, ''front'':''...'', ''back'':{''correct_answer'':''...'', ''explanation'':''...'',
  ''reference'':''Objective 1, Layer 1'', ''difficulty'':''Easy''}}, ...]. Ensure variety (MCQ 70%, cloze/short 30%), distractors
  per protocol, and progressive difficulty (Easy: L1/Remember -> Hard: L4/Create).'
