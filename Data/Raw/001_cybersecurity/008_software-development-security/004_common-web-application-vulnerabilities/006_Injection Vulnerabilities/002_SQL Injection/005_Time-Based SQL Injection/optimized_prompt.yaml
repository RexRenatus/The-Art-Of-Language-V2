active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the scenarios where time-based SQLi would be the attacker's preferred blind
    technique over boolean-based SQLi (e.g., high-traffic sites with suppressed errors). Provide real-world examples from
    breaches like the 2011 Sony Pictures hack and evaluate trade-offs in stealth vs. speed.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common errors: 1) Confuse with boolean/error-based (e.g., ''Uses true/false
      page changes'' instead of delays), 2) Wrong DBMS function (e.g., ''SLEEP()'' for MSSQL), 3) Misstate mitigation (e.g.,
      ''Input escaping alone prevents it'').'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on
  ''Time-Based SQL Injection'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Common Web Application Vulnerabilities
  > 001_Injection Vulnerabilities > SQL Injection > Time-Based SQL Injection). Strictly follow the provided schema: multiple-choice
  with 4 options (1 correct), detailed back with explanation, hints, Bloom level.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full list above]. Tag each card with matching Bloom level (balance: 20% Remember/Understand,
  30% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate, 20% Create).

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste full layers]. Distribute 12-13 cards per layer.

  - Active Learning: Weave in discussion/peer/problems (e.g., ''As in peer-teach: ...'').

  - Research/Completeness: OWASP A03:2021, CWE-89, PortSwigger labs, prevention (prepared stmts), detection (time anomalies),
  examples (SLEEP(5), WAITFOR).

  - Prior Knowledge: Link to basic SQLi.

  - Concept Map: Reference branches.


  Distractors: Follow protocol exactly (common misconceptions like confusing with boolean SQLi).
