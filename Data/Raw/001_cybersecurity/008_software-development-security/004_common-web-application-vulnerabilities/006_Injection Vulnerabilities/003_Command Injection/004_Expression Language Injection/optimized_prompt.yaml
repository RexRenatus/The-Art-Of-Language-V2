active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of prevention strategies for EL Injection (e.g., strict
    input allowlists vs. contextual escaping). Consider scenarios like high-traffic e-commerce sites vs. internal admin panels—which
    strategy is optimal and why? Link to OWASP guidelines and prior injection vulnerabilities.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    teach misconceptions (e.g., ''Command separators like ; work in EL'' as wrong).'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Expression Language (EL)\
  \ Injection (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Common Web Application Vulnerabilities > 001_Injection\
  \ Vulnerabilities > Command Injection > Expression Language Injection).\n\nGenerate 25-35 high-quality flashcards optimized\
  \ for spaced repetition and Bloom's Taxonomy progression. Cover all scaffolding layers, integrate voter consensus (code\
  \ examples in JSP/Spring/Thymeleaf, prevention strategies, prior links to Command Injection), research context (EL exploits\
  \ template engines for RCE via unsanitized input), and active learning hooks.\n\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES (ensure coverage):\n\
