active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate NIST SP 800-63B's recommendation for password length over composition rules (e.g., minimum 8 characters
    with no complexity requirements vs. traditional '8 chars + uppercase + number + symbol'). Use breach examples like the
    2012 LinkedIn incident (117M weak passwords exposed) to argue usability vs. security trade-offs. What evidence supports
    longer, simple passphrases (e.g., 'correcthorsebatterystaple') over complex short ones?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., ''use MD5 hashing'' vs. Argon2). Ensure distractors are realistic from breaches/historical rules.'

  - Active Learning: [Insert full active_learning JSON object here]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [Insert full scaffolding_layers JSON array here]

  - NIST SP 800-63B Key Points: Prefer length (≥8 chars, ≤64) over composition; blacklist compromised/common passwords; use
  memory-hard hashing (Argon2, scrypt); rate limiting; AALs integration.

  - Concept Map: Central ''Weak Password Requirements'' → ''Strength/Entropy'' → ''Attacks (Brute-Force/Dictionary)'' → ''NIST
  Guidelines'' → ''Integration (MFA/OWASP)''.
