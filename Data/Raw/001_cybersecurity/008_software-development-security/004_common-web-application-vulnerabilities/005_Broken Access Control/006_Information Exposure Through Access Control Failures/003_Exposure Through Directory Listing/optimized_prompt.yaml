active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the risks of enabling directory listing in different environments (development vs. production)
    and debate whether it should ever be enabled, even for convenience. Support arguments with references from OWASP Security
    Misconfiguration guidelines and NIST SP 800-44 on securing web servers, addressing common misconceptions.
  peer_teaching: 'Pair students: One student explains the root cause of directory listing and demonstrates disabling it on
    Apache or Nginx using local tools (e.g., XAMPP or Docker). The partner teaches back using a non-example (secure configuration)
    and verifies with curl. Switch roles to reinforce application and address configuration misconceptions.'
  problem_solving: Using a provided vulnerable web server (e.g., Docker image with enabled directory listing), scan for exposed
    directories, identify sensitive files (e.g., backups, configs), propose remediation steps (config changes for Apache/Nginx/IIS),
    implement the fix, and test verification (e.g., curl http://server/dir/ returns 403 or index file).

  Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for the topic ''Exposure Through Directory Listing'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > Software Development Security > Common Web Application Vulnerabilities > 003_Broken Access Control > Information Exposure
  Through Access Control Failures > Exposure Through Directory Listing). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives,
  active learning (discussion/peer/problem-solving), 4-layer scaffolding (Foundation/Components/Implementation/Integration),
  voter consensus on best practices (disable in Apache/Nginx/IIS, index files, audits, curl verification, sources: OWASP Wiki,
  NIST SP 800-44).
