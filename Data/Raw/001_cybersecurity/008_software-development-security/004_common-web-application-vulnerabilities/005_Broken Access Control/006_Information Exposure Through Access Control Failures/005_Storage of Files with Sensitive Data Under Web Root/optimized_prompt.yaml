  discussion_prompt: In a team debate, argue whether storing encrypted sensitive data (e.g., hashed passwords) under web root
    with .htaccess restrictions is secure enough. Cite OWASP Top 10 A01:2021 Broken Access Control, CWE-219, and Verizon DBIR
    (info disclosure in ~74% of breaches). Counter misconceptions like 'obfuscation is protection'.
  peer_teaching: 'Pair up: Student A draws and explains a vulnerable web directory structure (e.g., /public/.env with API
    keys); Student B critiques risks. Switch roles: Student B teaches mitigation using secrets managers like HashiCorp Vault
    and server configs.'
  problem_solving: Analyze a provided GitHub repo snippet or XAMPP setup with sensitive config files under /public/. Redesign
    the file structure, implement server configs (e.g., Apache <Directory> deny all</Directory> or Nginx location deny all;),
    load via environment variables, and test accessibility with curl.

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL ARRAY FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use elements to inspire higher-order questions (e.g., debate-style eval Qs).

  - Scaffolding Layers: Distribute coverage: 30% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 20% Layer 4.

  - Big Picture: Prevents info disclosure (94% breaches per Verizon DBIR); PCI DSS Req 3 full: Protect CHD with crypto, no
  public storage.

  - Sources: CWE-219 (cwe.mitre.org), OWASP A01:2021 (owasp.org), PCI DSS v4.0.


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards spanning all Bloom''s levels (even coverage). Follow exact schema: [{front, back, explanation,
  type, tags, bloom_level}, ...]. Vary difficulty; include code snippets in Qs (e.g., Apache config). MCQs: 4 options (A/B/C/D),
  bold correct. Ensure active recall, no cues in front. Tags from hierarchy + standards.'
