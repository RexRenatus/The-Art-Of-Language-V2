  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Sensitive data exposure is primarily a cryptography failure
    rather than an access control issue.'' Use OWASP A3:2017 and real-world examples like the Capital One breach to support
    your position, identifying common misconceptions such as confusing it with injection attacks.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
