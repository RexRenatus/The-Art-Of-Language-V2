active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, analyze the Capital One 2019 AWS breach caused by improper IAM role permissions
    (excessive S3 access). How did privilege creep contribute? Propose three mitigations aligned with PoLP and debate their
    feasibility in a cloud environment.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Grant all access upfront''
    for PoLP); 2) Confusable term (e.g., ''Privilege creep'' as ''temporary access''); 3) Partial truth (e.g., ''Permanent
    elevation is always secure if audited''). Ensure distractors test subtle differences (e.g., bracketing vs. permanent).
    Balance coverage: 40% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 30% APPLY/ANALYZE, 30% EVALUATE/CREATE.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Topic: Improper Privilege Management (Category: Cybersecurity > Software
  Development Security > Common Web Application Vulnerabilities > 003_Broken Access Control > Permission and Privilege Management
  Issues > Improper Privilege Management). Use the provided learning_objectives, active_learning components, scaffolding layers
  (4 progressive layers), and topic details (CWE-269, PoLP, Privilege Creep/Bracketing, NIST AC-6, AWS Well-Architected SEC03,
  Capital One breach example, concept map).


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards optimized for spaced repetition and active recall. Cover all Bloom''s levels proportionally,
  scaffold progressively (Layer1: 8 cards, Layer2: 8, Layer3: 7, Layer4: 7). Incorporate real-world examples, code snippets,
  prior knowledge (auth/authz/RBAC), and distractors per flashcard_schema.


  Output EXCLUSIVELY in the specified JSON array format from flashcard_schema. Each card must tag bloom_level, scaffolding_layer,
  and references. Explanations: 2-4 sentences, link to objectives/active activities (e.g., ''Supports APPLY objective; use
  in peer teaching''). Ensure completeness with sources: CWE.mitre.org/269, NIST SP800-53 AC-6, AWS Well-Architected Security
  Pillar SEC03, Kaspersky/OWASP resources.'
