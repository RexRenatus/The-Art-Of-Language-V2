active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss the security trade-offs between OIDC's Authorization Code Flow (with PKCE) and the deprecated
    Implicit Flow. In what scenarios would you recommend one over the other, and why? Consider real-world applications like
    SPAs vs. traditional web apps.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Outdated practice (e.g., Implicit Flow as ''recommended''), (3) Security anti-pattern (e.g., skipping PKCE). Ensure plausibility
    from research context or voter suggestions like missing validation.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education on ''OpenID Connect Integration'' (Category:
  Cybersecurity, Domain: Software Development Security, Subdomain: Secure Coding Guidelines and Standards, Entry: 005_Authentication
  and 001_Identity Management, Authentication Mechanisms). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities,
  scaffolding layers, and flashcard schema to generate 50 high-quality flashcards spanning all Bloom''s levels and layers.


  Incorporate research context: OIDC on OAuth 2.0 for identity verification via ID Tokens (JWTs); key flows (Authorization
  Code with PKCE recommended, Implicit deprecated, Hybrid); security (nonce, state, token validation); sources: https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html,
  https://openid.net/specs/oauth-v2.html.


  Voter priorities: Complete flows/mechanisms details, security considerations (PKCE, validation), real-world implementation.


  Generate flashcards progressively: 20% Layer 1 (Remember/Understand), 30% Layer 2 (Understand/Analyze), 30% Layer 3 (Apply/Analyze),
  20% Layer 4 (Evaluate/Create). Mix formats: 60% MCQ with 3 distractors, 20% cloze/short answer, 20% scenario-based.


  Output as JSON array of objects matching the flashcard schema exactly. Ensure pedagogical depth: tie to objectives/activities
  (e.g., ''For problem-solving exercise...''). No duplicates; optimize for active recall and spaced repetition.'
