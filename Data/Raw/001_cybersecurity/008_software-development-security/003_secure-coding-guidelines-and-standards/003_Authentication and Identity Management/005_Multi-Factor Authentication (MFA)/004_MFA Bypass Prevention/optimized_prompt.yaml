active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a debate format, argue whether traditional MFA methods (e.g., SMS OTP) should be fully deprecated
    in favor of phishing-resistant methods like FIDO2. Consider trade-offs in cost, usability, user adoption, and security
    effectiveness, using real-world examples from breaches like the Uber SIM swapping incident.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol:
    rules:
    - 'Generate 2-4 distractors that are plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., for FIDO2 prevention: ''SMS OTP with
      encryption'' instead of phishing-resistant hardware).'
    - Base on real bypass techniques or outdated practices (e.g., confuse SIM swapping with phishing).
    - Ensure one distractor is a 'half-truth' (e.g., partially correct but misses key vulnerability).
    - Avoid obviously wrong answers; test for trickiness to promote deeper understanding.
    variety: 'Mix Q types: 40% recall (list techniques), 30% application (code snippets), 20% analysis (compare methods),
      10% evaluation/create (scenario critique).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in MFA Bypass Prevention (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Secure Coding Guidelines and Standards > 005_Authentication and
  001_Identity Management > 004_Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) > MFA Bypass Prevention). Use the provided learning objectives,
  active learning components, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema to create high-quality, pedagogically optimized flashcards.


  Key Content to Cover (from research and voter consensus):

  - Common Bypass Techniques: Real-time phishing (live OTP capture), MFA fatigue (prompt bombing), SIM swapping (number porting),
  MITM (proxy interception), session hijacking (cookie theft), malware (screen scraping).

  - Prevention Best Practices: Phishing-resistant MFA (FIDO2/WebAuthn), NIST SP 800-63B (AAL levels), rate limiting, server-side
  validation, device binding, number verification, Zero Trust integration.

  - Sources: NIST SP 800-63B, OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet, FIDO Alliance Specifications.


  Incorporate Bloom''s Taxonomy progression, active learning ties, and scaffolding layers. Output exactly 50 flashcards in
