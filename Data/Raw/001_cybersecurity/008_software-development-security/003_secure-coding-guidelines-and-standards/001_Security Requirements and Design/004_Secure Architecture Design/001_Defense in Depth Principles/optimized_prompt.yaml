active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given limited budgets, debate whether prioritizing a single robust security control or implementing multiple
    layered defenses per defense-in-depth principles is more effective. Use real-world breach examples like Equifax (failed
    patching across layers) or SolarWinds (supply chain compromise breaching multiple layers) to support your argument.
  peer_teaching: Pair students and assign each pair a specific layer of defense (e.g., network, application, data encryption).
    One student explains the layer to their partner using NIST SSDF examples (e.g., PS for Protect Software); the partner
    teaches it back and quizzes on misconceptions like 'a firewall alone is sufficient' or 'encryption replaces access controls.'
  problem_solving: 'Provide a real-world scenario: developing a web application for a financial firm handling sensitive data.
    Students must design a defense-in-depth architecture, mapping threats (e.g., injection, unauthorized access) to SDLC phases
    and layers (per NIST CSF), then peer-review designs for gaps in coverage.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Defense in Depth (DiD)
  Principles within Software Development Security (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Secure
  Coding Guidelines and Standards > 001_Security Requirements and Design > Secure Architecture Design > Defense in Depth Principles).


  **Research Context (Complete):** Defense in Depth employs multiple layers (physical, network, host, application, data) of
  overlapping security controls across SDLC to mitigate threats. Integrates with NIST SSDF (SP 800-218: PO/PS/PW/RV practices),
  NIST CSF, OWASP SAMM, CIS Controls. Examples: Auth/authorization (app layer), encryption (data), logging/monitoring (all).
  No single control; failure of one doesn''t compromise all (e.g., SolarWinds: layered response limited damage). NCCIC/ICS-CERT
  emphasizes DiD for ICS/software (layered controls for resilience).

  Scaffold across 4 layers: [Insert full scaffolding here]. Incorporate Active Learning hooks (e.g., scenario fronts from
  discussion/problem-solving).


  **Generate Flashcards:** Follow exact schema: [Insert full flashcard_schema here]. Ensure 100% voter consensus coverage
  (pedagogy, completeness, activities). Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''type'':
  ''MCQ|QA|Cloze'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''...'', ''tags'': ''...''}]. Balance coverage: 25% per scaffolding
  layer. High-quality, exam-ready (e.g., CISSP, SSDF-aligned).'
