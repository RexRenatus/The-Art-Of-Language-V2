  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions: 1) Plausible but incomplete (e.g.,
    ''Virtualization only'' vs. full SC-3 boundary); 2) Confuses with related concepts (e.g., encryption vs. isolation); 3)
    Extreme/overgeneralized (e.g., ''No isolation needed in trusted environments''). Ensure distractors promote analysis.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy.
  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on ''Security Component Isolation'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development
