active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of developing custom security rules versus relying solely
    on vendor-provided standard rules. Consider factors like maintenance overhead, coverage for unique business logic vulnerabilities,
    required expertise, and alignment with organizational threat models. Support arguments with references to NIST SSDF or
    OWASP SAMM.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    vs. ''integrate into''), (2) Plausible but incomplete/overly broad term (e.g., ''Regex only'' vs. ''AST/Regex''), (3)
    Related but irrelevant concept (e.g., ''DAST'' vs. ''SAST''). Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter priorities
    and research context.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Topic: Custom Security Rule Development (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software
  Development Security > Secure Coding Guidelines and Standards > 018_Code Quality and Security Testing > Static 008_006_Application
  Security Testing (SAST) > Custom Security Rule Development). Use this COMPLETE research context: Custom security rules are
  tailored SAST checks for unique org risks, integrated into SDLC. Standards: NIST SP 800-218 SSDF (PW.1-8: Prepare, Protect,
  Produce secure software); ISO/IEC 27001 (Annex A.14: Secure dev processes); OWASP Secure Coding Practices (Quick Reference
  Guide); OWASP SAMM (Security Practices levels). Tools: Semgrep (rules.yaml), CodeQL (ql packs). Steps: Identify vuln > Define
  rule > Test > Integrate CI/CD. Sources: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/218/r1/final, https://owasp.org/www-project-samm/,
  https://semgrep.dev/docs/writing-rules/, https://codeql.github.com/docs/writing-codeql-queries/, https://www.iso.org/standard/27001.


  Incorporate EXACTLY: Learning objectives [paste array above], Active learning [summarize: discussion on trade-offs, peer
  teaching steps, problem-solving vuln exercise], Scaffolding [paste layers above including prior knowledge].


  Generate flashcards per schema [paste schema above]. Ensure even coverage: 6-8 cards per Bloom''s level, 4 layers. Promote
  active recall (no cues in front). Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, e.g., [ {card1}, {card2}, ... ]. Validate: Pedagogically
  sound, accurate to standards, no criminal content.'
