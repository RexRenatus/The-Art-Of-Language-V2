active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a debate format, argue whether mandating strict origin validation for all WSS connections is always
    necessary or if context-specific alternatives (e.g., token-based auth) suffice. Consider performance impacts, real-world
    examples like chat apps or gaming platforms, and trade-offs with usability. Support with references to RFC 6455 and OWASP
    guidelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives [insert learning_objectives array], active learning [insert active_learning object], 4-layer
  scaffolding [insert scaffolding_layers array].


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following this schema [insert flashcard_schema object]. Ensure completeness: Include
  RFC 6455, RFC 2818, OWASP Cheat Sheet, CSWSH mitigations (origin validation), code examples (Node.js/NGINX), prior knowledge
  (TLS/HTTP), big picture (real-time secure apps).


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"front": "Question?", "back": {"answer": "...", "distractors": ["opt1",
  "opt2", "opt3"], "bloom_level": "APPLY", "layer": 3, "explanation": "Detailed...", "source": "RFC 6455"}}. Balance: 40%
