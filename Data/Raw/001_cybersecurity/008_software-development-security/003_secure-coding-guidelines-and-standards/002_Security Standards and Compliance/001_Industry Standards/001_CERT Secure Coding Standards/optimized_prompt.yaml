active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss how CERT Secure Coding Standards fit into the Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), their
    role in reducing breach costs (e.g., IBM reports average breach cost at $4.45M in 2023), and pathways to expertise like
    CSSLP certification. Share real-world examples of vulnerabilities prevented by CERT rules.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
