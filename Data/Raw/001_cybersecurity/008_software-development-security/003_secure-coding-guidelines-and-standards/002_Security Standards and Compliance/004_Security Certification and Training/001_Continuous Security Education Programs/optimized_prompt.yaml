active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate whether continuous security education programs, as outlined in NIST SP 800-50, are more effective
    than one-time certifications in reducing secure coding vulnerabilities. Support arguments with evidence from SSDF practices
    (NIST SP 800-218), NIST CSF functions, and real-world breach case studies (e.g., injection vulnerabilities in Agile teams).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives, active learning (discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving), 4-layer scaffolding
  (Foundation: basics/prereqs; Components: frameworks; Implementation: steps/metrics; Integration: SDLC links), and prior
  knowledge (SDLC phases, threats).
