active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a multi-cloud organization using AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, discuss how vendor-specific security
    certifications complement general standards like NIST SP 800-53 and CIS Controls. What challenges arise in aligning them,
    and how can they enhance secure coding practices? Support your points with real-world examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - '1 plausible: Similar certification name or vendor (e.g., AWS Developer vs. Security).'
    - '1 common misconception: General cert like CompTIA Security+ as vendor-specific.'
    - '1 partial truth: Correct framework but wrong application (e.g., NIST but mismatched control).'
    - '1 unrelated/off-topic: Irrelevant standard like PCI-DSS.'
    - Ensure distractors promote analysis (e.g., compare cert scopes).

  Use the following context to generate high-quality MCQ flashcards for ''Vendor-Specific Security Certifications'' (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Secure Coding Guidelines and Standards > 002_Security Standards
  and Compliance > Security Certification and Training > Vendor-Specific Security Certifications).


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the ''learning_objectives'' array here].

  **Active Learning:** [Insert the ''active_learning'' object here].

  **Scaffolding:** [Insert the ''scaffolding'' object here].

  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly follow [Insert the ''flashcard_schema'' object here].


  **Additional Guidelines:**

  - Prerequisites: Assume knowledge of CompTIA Security+, OWASP Top 10, SDLC.

  - Concept Map Integration: Ensure flashcards link to NIST SP 800-53, CIS Controls, NICE Framework.

  - Voter Consensus: 85.7% approval; emphasize completeness with AWS Certified Security - Specialty, Microsoft Certified:
  Azure Security Engineer Associate, Google Professional Cloud Security Engineer.

  - Pedagogy: Scaffold from foundation to integration; tie to Bloom''s levels.

  - Output Format: JSON array of objects, each: {''front'': ''Question with A-D options'', ''back'': {''correct_answer'':
  ''A: Full answer'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''references'': [''links''], ''active_learning_tie'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'':
