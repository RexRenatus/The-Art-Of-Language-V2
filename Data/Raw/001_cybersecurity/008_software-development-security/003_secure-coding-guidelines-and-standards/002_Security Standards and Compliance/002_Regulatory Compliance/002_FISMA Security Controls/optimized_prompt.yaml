active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group, debate which NIST SP 800-53 control family (e.g., Access Control vs. Incident Response) is
    most critical for a high-impact federal healthcare system following a data breach like the OPM incident. Use real-world
    examples to support arguments and consider secure coding implications.
  peer_teaching: 'Pair up: One student explains the seven NIST RMF steps to their partner, who then teaches back one specific
    step (e.g., ''Prepare'' or ''Monitor'') with a secure coding example, such as input validation controls.'
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A federal agency is developing a cloud-based app handling sensitive data. Categorize the system
    per FIPS 199 (Low/Moderate/High impact), select baseline controls from SP 800-53 (focus on SA and SC families), and propose
    a mitigation plan integrating RMF steps. Discuss as a class.'

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per card: (1) Common misconception (e.g., ''FISMA is only NIST 800-53''
    vs. full framework), (2) Confusable similar term (e.g., RMF step mixed with SDLC phase), (3) Partial truth (e.g., wrong
    impact level for scenario). Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter-noted misconceptions like FISMA=NIST only.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in FISMA Security Controls
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Secure Coding Guidelines and Standards > 002_Security
  Standards and Compliance > Regulatory Compliance > FISMA Security Controls). Use the provided learning objectives, active
  learning activities, 4 scaffolding layers, and flashcard schema to generate high-quality, pedagogically optimized flashcards.


  Incorporate university-style pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy progression, active learning (e.g., end explanations with discussion
  hooks), scaffolding (tag each card to a layer), and web-grounded context (FISMA mandates NIST SP 800-53 controls via RMF;
  FIPS 199 for Low/Mod/High categorization; focus on secure coding families like SA/SC).


  Generate 40-60 flashcards covering all layers/Bloom''s levels balanced (e.g., 10 per layer). Use exact schema: {''front'':
  ''...'', ''back'': {...}}. Ensure distractors follow protocol. Draw from research: FISMA (law), NIST SP 800-53 (controls),
  RMF (7 steps), FIPS 199 (CIA impacts), integrations (FedRAMP). Include concept map elements in explanations. Output ONLY
  a JSON array of flashcards.'
