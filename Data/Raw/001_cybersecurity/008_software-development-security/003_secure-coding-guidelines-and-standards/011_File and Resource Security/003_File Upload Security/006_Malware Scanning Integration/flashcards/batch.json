This allows for better detection of coordinated attacks, analysis of trends, and faster, more informed incident response, which is difficult with scattered logs.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors focus on irrelevant cost implications, misunderstand the function of centralization (it doesn't prevent individual scans or updates), and fail to grasp the critical importance of aggregated data for threat intelligence and incident response.",
        "analogy": "Failing to centralize logs is like having security cameras in every room but no central monitoring station; you can see individual events, but you can't easily piece together a larger incident or spot a pattern of activity."
