  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether the benefits of real-time push notifications in banking apps outweigh
    the security risks, citing OWASP MASVS controls (e.g., MASVS-NETWORK) and real-world breaches like the 2023 MOVEit vulnerability
    chain impacting notifications. Use evidence from NIST SP 800-63-4 on digital identity guidelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Mobile Push Notification\
  \ Security (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Secure Coding Guidelines and Standards > Mobile\
  \ 008_Application Security > Mobile Communication Security > Mobile Push Notification Security).\n\nIncorporate these pedagogical\
  \ elements:\n- Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]\n- Active Learning: Embed questions from discussion (risk\
  \ trade-offs), peer teaching (explain flows), problem-solving (scenarios/fixes).\n- Scaffolding: Distribute across layers\
  \ – Foundation (10 cards), Components (10), Implementation (15), Integration (15).\n- Prior Knowledge: Assume basics in\
