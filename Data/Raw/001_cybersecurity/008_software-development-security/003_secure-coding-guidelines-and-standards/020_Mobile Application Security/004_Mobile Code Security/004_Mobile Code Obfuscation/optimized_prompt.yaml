  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the role of obfuscation in a defense-in-depth strategy: Is it sufficient
    as a standalone security measure, or must it always be combined with runtime protections like RASP? Support your view
    with examples of techniques like control flow flattening and real-world attack scenarios.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    instead of methods), 2) Common confusion (e.g., ''ProGuard only for iOS''), 3) Extreme/overstated (e.g., ''Obfuscation
    prevents all tampering''). Ensure they test nuance from voter suggestions (e.g., trade-offs).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Mobile Code Obfuscation
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Secure Coding Guidelines and Standards > Mobile 008_Application
  Security > Mobile Code Security > Mobile Code Obfuscation). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities,
  4-layer scaffolding, voter consensus (e.g., complete techniques: renaming, minification, control flow flattening, string
  encryption, fake control flow, packers, anti-debugging, native obfuscation; tools: ProGuard/DexGuard/R8 Android, iXGuard
  iOS; code snippets, limitations, best practices, prior links), and research context (definitions, advantages vs. RE/tampering/IP
  theft) to create 50 high-quality flashcards.


  Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom''s progression, active learning hooks, scaffolding. Ensure completeness per voters
  (100% approval).


  Output exactly 50 flashcards in JSON array format: [{''id'':1, ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''distractors'': [''opt1'',''opt2'',''opt3''] (if MCQ, else []), ''metadata'': {''blooms_level'':''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'':1-4,
