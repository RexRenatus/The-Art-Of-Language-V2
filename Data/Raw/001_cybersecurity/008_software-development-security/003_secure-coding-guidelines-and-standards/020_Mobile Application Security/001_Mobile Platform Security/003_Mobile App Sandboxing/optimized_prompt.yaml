active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of strict sandboxing (e.g., reduced attack surface vs. potential
    usability limitations). Use real-world examples from iOS or Android apps to support your arguments and reference OWASP
    MASVS requirements for mobile app isolation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives** (span Bloom''s): [Insert full list above].

  - **Active Learning** (hint on cards): [Insert summaries].

  - **Scaffolding** (layer each card): [Insert full layers].

  - **Research Context**: Core: Sandboxing via least privilege isolates apps (iOS: Entitlements/kernel; Android: UID/SELinux/permissions).
  OWASP MASVS v2 (https://mas.owasp.org/MASVS/): MSTG-PLATFORM-1 enforces isolation. Apple: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/app-sandbox.
  Prior Knowledge: OS processes, permissions.

  - **Concept Map**: Central [Sandboxing] → [Least Privilege, Attack Surface Reduction] → [iOS App Sandbox, Android UID/SELinux]
  → [OWASP MASVS].


  Generate flashcards per **Flashcard Schema** [Insert full schema]. Output ONLY valid JSON array of objects, each: {"front":
