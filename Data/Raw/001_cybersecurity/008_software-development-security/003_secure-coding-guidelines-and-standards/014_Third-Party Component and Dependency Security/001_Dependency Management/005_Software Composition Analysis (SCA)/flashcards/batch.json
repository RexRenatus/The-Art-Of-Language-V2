        "core_logic": "The primary challenge is the inherent complexity and lack of visibility into the vast number of third-party and open-source components used, because modern software is rarely built from scratch, making it difficult to track all potential risks. SCA provides this visibility, working by inventorying and analyzing these components.",

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Automating SCA early and often is a best practice because it enables developers to identify and fix vulnerabilities and license issues when they are cheapest and easiest to resolve, since issues found later in the SDLC are significantly more costly to address. This works by integrating scanning tools into the build and development workflow.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors suggest inefficient or limited use of SCA, such as scanning only at the end, manual review, or post-deployment audits, which fail to leverage its full potential for proactive security.",
