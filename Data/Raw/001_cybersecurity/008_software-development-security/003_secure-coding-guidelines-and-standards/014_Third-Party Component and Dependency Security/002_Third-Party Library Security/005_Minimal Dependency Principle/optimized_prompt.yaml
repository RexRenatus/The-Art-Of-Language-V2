active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of strictly adhering to the Minimal Dependency Principle in a fast-paced agile
    development environment. When might more dependencies be acceptable (e.g., for rapid prototyping), and what mitigations
    (e.g., SCA tools, SBOMs) can be applied? Use real-world examples like Log4j or SolarWinds to argue for or against 'zero
    dependencies is always best.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
