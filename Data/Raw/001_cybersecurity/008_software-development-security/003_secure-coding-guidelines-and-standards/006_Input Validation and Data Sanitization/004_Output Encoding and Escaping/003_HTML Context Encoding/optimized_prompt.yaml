active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Analyze why HTML context encoding must be context-specific. Using OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet guidelines,
    debate scenarios where using the wrong encoding type (e.g., HTML body encoding in an attribute) leads to XSS. Provide
    vulnerable and fixed code examples in PHP or JS.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains encoding rules for a specific HTML context (e.g., attributes vs. JS), while
    the other uses teach-back by fixing a provided vulnerable snippet. Switch roles and contexts (text, URL, CSS).
  problem_solving: Debug 3 real-world code snippets vulnerable to XSS (e.g., user comments in HTML body/attributes). Apply
    context-aware encoding, test with payloads like '<script>alert(1)</script>', and verify fixes using browser dev tools.

  Incorporate:

  - Research: HTML encoding prevents XSS by transforming < to &lt; etc. Key sources: OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet (https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html),
  DOM-based XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet (https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/DOM_based_XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html
  - full rules for sinks like document.write, eval; avoid innerHTML).

  - Learning Objectives: [insert the 6 objectives above].

  - Active Learning: Inspire cards from activities (e.g., debate prompts as Analyze MCQs, code fixes as Apply).

  - Scaffolding: [insert the 4 layers above, including table, prior knowledge, misconceptions, tools].

  - Examples: Vulnerable PHP: echo ''<div>'' . $_GET[''user''] . ''</div>''; Secure: echo ''<div>'' . htmlspecialchars($_GET[''user''],
  ENT_QUOTES, ''UTF-8'') . ''</div>''; JS: elem.innerHTML = userInput; -> elem.textContent = userInput;


  Generate flashcards per schema: [insert full schema above]. Output as JSON array of objects, each with front, back, explanation,
  metadata. Ensure completeness: full DOM XSS details, all sources listed, context table referenced, code in PHP/JS. High-quality,
  exam-ready, no hallucinations.'
