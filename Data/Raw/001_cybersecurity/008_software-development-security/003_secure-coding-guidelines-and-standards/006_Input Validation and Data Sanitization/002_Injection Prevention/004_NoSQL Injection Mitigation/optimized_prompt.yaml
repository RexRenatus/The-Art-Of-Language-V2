active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast NoSQL injection vulnerabilities with traditional SQL injection. In groups, debate
    which is more dangerous in modern scalable applications like those using MongoDB, and propose mitigation strategies tailored
    to NoSQL data models such as parameterized queries and input whitelisting.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    like SQL''); 2) Partial truth/mixed concept (e.g., ''Relies only on input validation, ignoring ORMs''); 3) Related but
    incorrect (e.g., ''Mitigated solely by firewalls''). Ensure distractors are realistic errors from research context (e.g.,
    confusing data models) and avoid obvious wrongs.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NoSQL Injection Mitigation
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Secure Coding Guidelines and Standards > 003_Input Validation
  and Data Sanitization > Injection Prevention > NoSQL Injection Mitigation). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy,
  active learning, scaffolding.


  CONTENT CONTEXT: Integrate research - NoSQL injection exploits unsanitized user input in NoSQL queries (MongoDB, etc.),
  differing from SQL via procedural langs/data models. Mitigations: input validation/whitelisting (Joi), parameterized queries
  (MongoDB $eq/$in), safe APIs/ORMS (Mongoose), avoid $where/$regex. Standards: OWASP ASVS V5/V7, NIST SP 800-53 SA-8, SP
  800-95. Sources: owasp.org/attacks/NoSQL_injection, docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/security/, nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf.
