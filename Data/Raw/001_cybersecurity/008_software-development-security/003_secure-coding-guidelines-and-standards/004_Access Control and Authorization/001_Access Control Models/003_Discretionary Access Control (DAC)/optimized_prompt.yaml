  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of DAC's flexibility versus the stricter controls of MAC
    or RBAC in a scenario where developers need quick resource sharing but must prevent data leaks. Support your position
    with real-world examples like Unix file permissions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Use elements from other models: e.g., ''Central administrator'' (MAC), ''Role assignment'' (RBAC), ''Attribute evaluation''

    - 'Common misconceptions: e.g., DAC is ''mandatory'' or prevents propagation.'
    - 'Partial truths: e.g., ''Capabilities only'' when ACLs are primary.'
    - 'Real-world confusions: e.g., Unix examples mixed with Windows.'
    - 'Voter-suggested examples: MCQs on authority granter (owner vs. admin/role), mechanisms (ACLs vs. labels).'
    examples:
    - 'Q: In DAC, who grants access? A. Resource owner (correct), B. Central admin (MAC distractor), C. Role manager (RBAC),
      D. Policy engine (ABAC).'
    - 'TF: ''DAC prevents owners from propagating access rights.'' False—explain propagation.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Discretionary Access Control

  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives**: [Insert full array from above]

  - **Active Learning**: Use for scenario flashcards.

  - **Scaffolding**: Prior Knowledge + 4 Layers [Insert full scaffolding from above]. Cover all in flashcards.

  - **Research Context**: DAC: Owners control access to objects via ACLs/capabilities. Subjects seek permissions (read/write).
  Flexible but vulnerable to mismanagement. Vs. MAC (labels/admin), RBAC (roles), ABAC (attributes). Vulns: privilege escalation,
  Trojans.

  - **Voter Consensus**: 82.9% approval; complete comparisons, add code/impl, big picture, knowledge checks.


  **Generate 25 high-quality flashcards** using the exact schema:

  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as an object with ''front'', ''back'' (nested object), and ''metadata''. Ensure
  distractors follow protocol. Tie to Bloom''s, layers, and objectives for spaced repetition optimization.'
