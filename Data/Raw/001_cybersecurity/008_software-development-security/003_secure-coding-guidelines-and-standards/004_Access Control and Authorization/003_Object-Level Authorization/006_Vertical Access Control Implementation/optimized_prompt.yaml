active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using pure RBAC versus ABAC for implementing Vertical
    Access Control in a healthcare application where users have hierarchical roles (e.g., nurse vs. doctor accessing patient
    records). Consider scalability, flexibility, and common pitfalls like attribute source trust—provide evidence from NIST
    SP 800-162.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: Distractors must be plausible (e.g., common misconceptions like confusing PDP/PEP), derived from pitfalls/real
    errors; never correct or absurd; ensure no overlap with answer; for vertical focus, include RBAC/ABAC mix-ups or escalation
    examples.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Secure Coding Guidelines.
  Generate 30-50 high-quality flashcards on ''Vertical Access Control Implementation'' (Category: Cybersecurity, Domain: Software
  Development Security, Subdomain: Secure Coding Guidelines and Standards, Entry: 007_Access Control and Authorization, Object-Level
  Authorization). Builds on RBAC; Vertical Access Control enforces hierarchical ABAC to prevent privilege escalation (NIST
  SP 800-162, OWASP Broken Access Control).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [paste the 6 objectives above].

  - Scaffolding: Strictly 4 layers [paste scaffolding details].

  - Active learning: Tie 20% cards to activities (e.g., ''Discuss pitfalls...'' Qs).

  - Prior knowledge: Assume RBAC familiarity; contrast with ABAC.

  - Content: Precise definitions (Vertical ≠ standard NIST term; = hierarchical anti-escalation); code (Spring Security ABAC
  examples); pitfalls (tampering, perf); sources (NIST 800-162, OWASP).


  Use EXACT flashcard_schema: JSON array of objects with snake_case fields (flashcard_id, question_text, correct_answer, distractors
  [array of 3 for MCQ], explanation, bloom_level, scaffolding_layer, type). Distractors: 3 plausible only for MCQ. Balance:
  60% MCQ, etc. Varied Bloom''s/layers. Ensure JSON parsable, educational, no speculation—ground in standards.'
