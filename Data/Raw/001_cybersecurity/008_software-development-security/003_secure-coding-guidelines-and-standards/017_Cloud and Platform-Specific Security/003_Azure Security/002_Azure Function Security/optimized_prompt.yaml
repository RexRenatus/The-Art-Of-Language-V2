active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the security trade-offs of serverless architectures like Azure Functions
    (e.g., reduced infrastructure management vs. increased blast radius from code vulnerabilities). Cite MCSB controls and
    real-world breaches to support arguments, aiming for consensus on 3 best practices.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education on ''Azure Function Security'' (Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Secure Coding Guidelines > 019_Cloud and Platform-Specific Security > Azure
  Security > Azure Function Security). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning ideas for inspiration, 4-layer
  scaffolding, prior knowledge, and concept map to create 50 high-quality flashcards (12-13 per layer, balanced across Bloom''s
  levels: 20% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 50% Evaluate/Create).


  Incorporate research context: Serverless on Azure App Service; MCSB baselines (PL, IM, DP controls); Well-Architected Framework;
  Key areas: Platform (HTTPS), Identity (managed identities, Azure AD), Network (VNet), Code (secure practices), Secrets (Key
  Vault), Monitoring (App Insights), Threat Mgmt (Defender). Voter priorities: Complete coverage, pedagogy progression, SMART
  objectives.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards matching the exact schema: {id, bloom_level, layer, question_type, front, back, options
