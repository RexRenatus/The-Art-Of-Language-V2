        "core_logic": "While CIS Control 2 cannot prevent zero-day exploits directly, its emphasis on authorized software and application whitelisting significantly mitigates the risk. By ensuring only approved code runs, it limits the potential attack surface and the blast radius if a zero-day is exploited within an authorized application.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The first distractor is impossible as zero-days are unpatched. The second suggests a detection capability that is extremely difficult for unknown threats. The third proposes an open-source requirement, which is not the primary mechanism CIS Control 2 uses to address zero-days.",
        "analogy": "It's like having strict security checkpoints at a building entrance; even if a known intruder has a new disguise (zero-day), they still can't get past the initial authorized entry checks."

        "core_logic": "A detailed software inventory is vital for incident response because it helps responders quickly identify compromised systems, understand the software running on them, and determine the potential impact. CIS Control 2 recognizes this because effective recovery requires knowing exactly what needs to be restored or secured.",
