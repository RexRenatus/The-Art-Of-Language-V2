  **Research Context (Complete):** CAPTCHA prevents bots via challenges. Types: Text/image/audio (legacy), invisible (reCAPTCHA
  v3 scores 0-1 risk). Threats: Credential stuffing (CISA AL21-131A), carding. Standards: OWASP ASVS v14.2.3 (server-verify),
  Automated Threats Cheat Sheet; W3C WCAG 2.1 (audio alternatives for SC 1.1.1); NIST SP 800-63B (bot mitigations); Google
  reCAPTCHA docs (v3: behavioral scoring, no user interaction); hCaptcha alternatives. Best practices: Server-side validation,
  accessibility fallbacks, minimize friction, integrate with WAF/rate-limiting. Sources: OWASP.org, w3.org/WAI, cisa.gov,
  developers.google.com/recaptcha.


  **Incorporate Exactly:**

  - Learning Objectives: [paste learning_objectives JSON]

  - Active Learning: [paste active_learning_components JSON] – Inspire cards that test these (e.g., scenario Qs from problem-solving).

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste scaffolding_layers JSON] – Ensure 25% coverage per layer.

  - Flashcard Schema: [paste flashcard_generation_schema JSON] – Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcards matching this exactly.
  No extra text.


  Generate cards progressively: Start with Layer 1/Remember, build to Layer 4/Create. Use real code snippets/pseudocode in
  Qs. Promote active learning (e.g., ''How would you debate this trade-off?''). Ensure web-grounded accuracy.'
