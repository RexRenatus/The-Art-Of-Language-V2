active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Examine the 18 HIPAA identifiers and debate edge cases, such as whether a partial ZIP code (first 3 digits
    only) combined with a rare medical condition or IP address constitutes re-identifiable PHI. How should developers handle
    such ambiguities in secure coding practices, like input validation or logging policies?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student teaches the partner the 18 PHI identifiers using real-world software examples (e.g.,
    email in user auth logs, IP in app telemetry, dates in database records). Switch roles and use teach-back with non-examples
    (e.g., aggregated anonymized stats) to test understanding and clarify misconceptions.
  problem_solving: 'Given a mock healthcare app dataset excerpt (e.g., log: ''User john.doe@email.com (SSN: 123-45-6789) from
    IP 192.168.1.1 accessed record #12345 on 2023-05-15 with diagnosis: rare_condition''), identify all PHI instances, propose
    de-identification methods (e.g., date generalization to year-only, pseudonymization of names), and implement/discuss secure
    coding solutions like regex validation for SSNs/emails or logging sanitization.'

  Core Content: PHI (HIPAA: individually identifiable health info by covered entities). ePHI (electronic). De-identify by
  removing 18 identifiers: 1.Names; 2.Geographic <state (street,city,zip first3 ok); 3.Dates(except year); 4.Age>89; 5.Phone;
  6.Fax; 7.Email; 8.SSN; 9.Med record #; 10.Health plan #; 11.Account #; 12.Cert/license #; 13.Vehicle/plate; 14.Device/serial
  #; 15.IP/URL; 16.Biometrics; 17.Photos; 18.Other unique codes. Sources: HHS.gov, NIST SP800-66.


  Use this pedagogy:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Scaffolding: Generate cards progressively (20% Layer1, 25% L2, 30% L3, 25% L4).

  - Active Learning: Infuse scenarios from discussion/peer/problem-solving (e.g., edge cases, logs, code reviews).

  - Engagement: Include think-pair-share/role-play prompts in explanations.


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards per schema: [{''front'': ''Q text'', ''back'': ''A + Explanation + Bloom:Level
  + Layer:X + Ref''}, ...]. Ensure variety, no duplicates, high-quality distractors. Cover software examples (code snippets,
  regex, logs). Make educational, measurable, spaced-repetition optimized.'
