active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between data utility and privacy protection in anonymization techniques like k-anonymity
    versus differential privacy. Which is more suitable for a healthcare dataset containing patient records with quasi-identifiers
    (e.g., age, ZIP code, diagnosis), and why? Consider re-identification risks, regulatory compliance (GDPR/CCPA), and real-world
    examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - D1: Common misconception (e.g., ''k-anonymity guarantees no re-identification'' vs. reality: background knowledge attacks).

    - D2: Confusable similar concept (e.g., l-diversity vs. t-closeness).

    - D3: Extreme/overgeneralized (e.g., ''Anonymization is always reversible'' vs. irreversible).

    Ensure distractors are web-grounded (e.g., from NIST/ICO pitfalls) and promote active recall.'
