active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for data at rest
    and Always Encrypted for column-level protection. Consider factors like performance overhead, key management complexity,
    application changes required, and compliance with OWASP A02:2021 Cryptographic Failures. Support arguments with real-world
    breach examples like Equifax.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1 based on common pitfalls (e.g., ''TDE encrypts data in transit'' –
      confuses at rest/transit), 1 semantic confusion (e.g., symmetric for asymmetric), 1 edge case reversal (e.g., ''Always
      Encrypted requires app changes'' as pro instead of con). Ensure 70% distractors from research/voter common errors like
      poor key management.'
    variety: Mix true/false hybrids, partial truths, outdated standards (e.g., DES vs AES-256).
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Database Encryption Implementation
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Secure Coding Guidelines and Standards > 012_Data Protection
  and Privacy > Data Storage Security > Database Encryption Implementation). Use the provided Learning Objectives (Bloom''s
  Taxonomy), Active Learning activities, Scaffolding Layers (4 progressive), and Flashcard Schema to generate high-quality,
  optimized flashcards.


  Incorporate:

  - Voter consensus (87.1% approval): Explicit Bloom''s objectives (e.g., define TDE, compare TDE vs Always Encrypted, critique
  NIST SP 800-57), 4 layers, prior knowledge links, key management best practices (AES-256, rotation), standards (NIST SP
  800-57 full, FIPS 140-3, PCI-DSS, GDPR), pitfalls, big picture (OWASP A02:2021, Equifax breach).

  - Research context: Core concepts (encryption, TDE=automatic file encryption e.g. Oracle, Always Encrypted=client-side,
  symmetric/asymmetric, keys, data at rest/transit).


  Generate 75 flashcards following the exact Flashcard Schema: Varied question types, distractor protocol, full back-side
  elements. Categorize by Scaffolding Layer and tag Bloom''s level. Ensure university pedagogy: Scaffolded progression, active
  recall, misconceptions addressed.
