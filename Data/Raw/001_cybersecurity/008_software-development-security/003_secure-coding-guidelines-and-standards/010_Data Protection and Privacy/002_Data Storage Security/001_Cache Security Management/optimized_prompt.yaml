    (e.g., ''Cache-Control: public'' as secure for private data; confusing no-cache vs. no-store; assuming browser caches
    are always encrypted). Distractors must be realistic (e.g., from real-world errors), reference voter-noted pitfalls like
    ''browser caches are always private'', and be explained in ''why wrong'' sub-section of explanation.'

  Use this complete Research Context:

  Cache Security Management protects cached data from unauthorized access/modification/disclosure. Core Concepts: Caching
  (browser/CDN/app/DB levels), Cache Poisoning (inject malicious data), Cache Invalidation (remove stale data), Secrets Management
  (no plain-text secrets in caches). Standards: RFC 9111 (HTTP Caching: Cache-Control (no-store, private, no-cache, max-age=0,
  must-revalidate), Vary), NIST SP 800-161 (supply chain risk mgmt: secure dev practices for data storage, prevent tampering),
  OWASP Secure Coding (avoid caching PII). Best Practices: Use no-store/private for sensitive data; encrypt caches (AES);
  invalidation (TTL, purge APIs); integrate secrets tools (Vault); link to XSS/injection defenses. Concept Map: Central ''Cache
  Security Management'' → Poisoning/Inval./Headers/Encryption → Parent ''Data Storage Security''.
