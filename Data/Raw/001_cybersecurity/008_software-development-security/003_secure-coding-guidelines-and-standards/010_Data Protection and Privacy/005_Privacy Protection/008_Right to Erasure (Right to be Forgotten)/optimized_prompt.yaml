active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the following: ''Should the Right to Erasure be made absolute, overriding all legal holds or
    public interest exceptions? Use real-world examples like the Google Spain case and consider implications for cybersecurity
    and free speech.'' Encourage participants to reference GDPR Article 17 conditions and common misconceptions.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    data''), (2) Partial truths (e.g., other GDPR rights), (3) Edge cases/exceptions (e.g., public interest), (4) Irrelevant
    standards (e.g., mix CCPA with GDPR). Ensure distractors teach by correction.'

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list from above]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert full scaffolding from above]

  - Active Learning: Use for inspiration (e.g., scenario cards from problem-solving).

  - Research Context: GDPR Article 17; key terms (personal data, controller, subject); conditions (no longer necessary, consent
  withdrawn); exceptions (legal holds); evolutions (Google Spain); globals (CCPA); standards (OWASP Data Protection Cheat
  Sheet, NIST SP 800-53/Privacy Framework); secure coding (pseudocode, hard/soft deletes, audit logs).

  - Voter Priorities: Common misconceptions, prior knowledge (GDPR basics), big picture (privacy-by-design), practical code
  examples.
