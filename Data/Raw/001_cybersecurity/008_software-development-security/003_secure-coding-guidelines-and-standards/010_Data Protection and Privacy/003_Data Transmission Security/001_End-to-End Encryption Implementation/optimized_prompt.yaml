active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate whether E2EE is overkill for all applications—debate using real-world examples like Signal (strong
    E2EE) vs. Zoom (TLS-only), considering trade-offs in usability, performance, and compliance with privacy laws like GDPR.
    Groups present pros/cons and vote on scenarios where E2EE is essential.
  peer_teaching: 'Teach-back activity: In pairs, one student explains the roles of public/private keys and hybrid encryption
    in E2EE using a locked box analogy (public key locks, private key unlocks); switch roles and quiz each other on key exchange
    protocols like ECDH.'
  problem_solving: 'Hands-on exercise: Implement a simple E2EE messenger in Python using the cryptography library (e.g., Fernet
    for symmetric encryption after ECDH key exchange). Test against a simulated MITM attack by intercepting traffic. Extend
    to add forward secrecy and discuss fixes for common pitfalls like key reuse.'

    – no, that''s encryption at rest); 2) Close concept mix-up (e.g., ''TLS provides E2EE'' – no, only in-transit); 3) Partial
    truth (e.g., ''Service providers hold decryption keys'' – no, in true E2EE they don''t). Ensure distractors test higher-order
    thinking where possible.'

  \ these elements:\n- Learning Objectives: [REMEMBER: Recall definitions... ] (use exactly as provided).\n- Active Learning:\
  \ Tie flashcards to discussion (e.g., Signal vs Zoom), peer teaching (key analogies), problem-solving (Python MITM sim).\n\
  - Scaffolding: Generate flashcards across 4 layers (Layer1: Foundation basics; Layer2: Components like ECDH/hybrid; Layer3:\
  \ Implementation with libsodium/Python code; Layer4: Integration pitfalls/PFS).\n- Research Context: Ground in core concepts\
  \ (E2EE ensures sender-to-recipient only access; differs from TLS in-transit; benefits include safeguarding privacy from\
  \ intermediaries). Use libsodium, Signal Protocol, ECDH, AES-GCM. Complete benefits: privacy, compliance (GDPR), resistance\
  \ to server compromise.\n\nGenerate 25 high-quality flashcards following the exact Flashcard Schema:\n- Structure: {type,\
  \ front, back, tags, [mcq_specific if MCQ]}\n- Distractor Protocol: Plausible errors (misconceptions, mix-ups).\n- Rules:\
  \ Balance Bloom/layers, include code snippets, explanations reference objectives/layers.\n\nOutput ONLY a JSON array of\
