active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how immutable infrastructure aligns with zero-trust principles and the
    Essential Eight strategies (e.g., patching via pipelines rather than in-place changes). Provide examples from AWS Well-Architected
    Framework (REL08-BP04) and discuss trade-offs in a cloud-native environment like Kubernetes.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions: 1) Mutable anti-patterns
    (e.g., ''in-place patching'', ''manual SSH''), 2) Partial truths (e.g., ''reboot server'' instead of replace), 3) Confused
    tools (e.g., ''use Ansible for config management'' vs. IaC). Ensure distractors are realistic from voter examples and
    research (e.g., configuration drift causes).'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom's Taxonomy, active\
  \ learning, and scaffolding. Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on 'Immutable Infrastructure Implementation' (Topic Hierarchy:\
  \ Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Secure Coding Guidelines and Standards > 017_Configuration and Deployment\
  \ Security > Deployment Security > Immutable Infrastructure Implementation). Prerequisites: IaC, Docker, CI/CD.\n\nIncorporate:\n\
  - Learning Objectives: [paste the exact array above].\n- Scaffolding Layers: [paste the exact scaffolding object above].\
