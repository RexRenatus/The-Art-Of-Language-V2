active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of implementing RLS at the database level versus filtering
    data in the application layer for a multi-tenant SaaS platform. Consider factors like security robustness, performance
    overhead, and maintenance complexity. Provide evidence from PostgreSQL documentation or OWASP guidelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
