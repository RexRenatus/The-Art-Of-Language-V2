active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of implementing strict Database Network Access Restrictions
    (e.g., IP whitelisting and zero-trust) versus broader access for developer convenience in a high-traffic e-commerce application.
    Reference NIST AC-4 and CIS Control 12, and propose a balanced policy while considering CIA Triad impacts.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full array above]

  - Active Learning: [reference components for contextual questions]

  - Scaffolding: [paste full layers above] – Distribute flashcards evenly (25% per layer).

  - Research: Upholds CIA Triad via firewalls/VPNs/ACLs/IP whitelisting; examples PostgreSQL/MySQL/AWS VPCs; prior knowledge:
  TCP/IP ports, basic ACLs.


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards (10 per 3 Bloom''s groups: Remember/Understand, Apply/Analyze, Evaluate/Create). Cover
  all objectives, layers, standards. Use Flashcard Schema exactly (JSON array). Vary types: 70% MCQ with distractors, 20%
  Q&A, 10% cloze. Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, measurable via explanations. Output
  ONLY the JSON array of flashcards.'
