active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a defense-in-depth strategy, how does database audit logging contribute to NIST's Detect and Respond
    functions? Discuss trade-offs between comprehensive event coverage (e.g., all SELECTs on sensitive tables) and performance
    overhead, using examples from Oracle Unified Auditing vs. PostgreSQL pgaudit.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 50-100 high-quality Anki-style flashcards optimized for spaced repetition, using university pedagogy: Bloom''s
  Taxonomy (tag each: REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND/APPLY/ANALYZE/EVALUATE/CREATE), active learning hooks, and scaffolding layers.


  **Content Scope:** Cover Oracle (Unified/FGA/common/local), PostgreSQL (pgaudit), MySQL (audit plugin), SQL Server (audits).
  Include standards (NIST SP 800-53 AU family, CIS Benchmarks), defense-in-depth, SIEM integration, compliance (GDPR). Use
  provided scaffolding layers for progressive complexity. Link to prior knowledge (basic SQL/users, app logging). Concept
  map: Audit Logging → Types/Scope/Events/Standards.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives above verbatim].


  **Scaffolding:** Strictly base cards on 4 layers: [Insert full scaffolding key_content verbatim].


  **Flashcard Format (JSON array):** Each card: {"front": "... [TAG: Bloom-Layer-DB]", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation":
  "...", "active_hook": "...", "references": "..."}}. Use schema: Varied Q types, distractors as specified.


  **Active Learning Integration:** Every 5-10 cards, include hook from [discussion/peer/problem-solving].


  **Quality Rules:** Evidence-based (cite sources), misconception-proof distractors, multi-DB balance (25% each), progressive
  (L1 simple recall → L4 synthesis). No fluff; precise, actionable. Output ONLY the JSON array of flashcards.'
