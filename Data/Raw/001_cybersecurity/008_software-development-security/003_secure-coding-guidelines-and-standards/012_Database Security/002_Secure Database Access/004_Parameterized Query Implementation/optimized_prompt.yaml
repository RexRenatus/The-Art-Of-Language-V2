active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, identify real-world scenarios (e.g., login forms, search features) vulnerable
    to SQL injection. Debate the pros/cons of parameterized queries vs. other defenses like input sanitization, referencing
    OWASP Top 10.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''escapes input only''),
    2) Partial truth (e.g., ''same as string concat but faster''), 3) Unrelated concept (e.g., ''encrypts data''). Base on
    real errors from OWASP or common pitfalls like forgetting to bind params.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom''s Taxonomy, active
  learning, and secure coding. Topic: Parameterized Query Implementation (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development
  Security > Secure Coding Guidelines and Standards > 012_Database Security > Secure Database Access > Parameterized Query
  Implementation). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema
  to generate 25 high-quality flashcards.


  Incorporate:

  - Voter priorities: Full Java/Python/PHP code examples, OWASP sources.

  - Prior knowledge: SQL basics, input validation, SQL injection.

  - Pedagogy: Objectives span Remember to Create; activities for engagement.


  Generate flashcards strictly per schema: Mix types (5 Definition, 5 Explanation, 5 Code Completion, 5 Comparison, 3 Evaluation,
  2 Creation). Tag each with Bloom level and Scaffolding layer. Use distractors per protocol.


  Output JSON array: [{''type'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': 1-4, ''front'': ''...'', ''back'':
  ''...''}]. Ensure educational, precise, and testable. No fluff.'
