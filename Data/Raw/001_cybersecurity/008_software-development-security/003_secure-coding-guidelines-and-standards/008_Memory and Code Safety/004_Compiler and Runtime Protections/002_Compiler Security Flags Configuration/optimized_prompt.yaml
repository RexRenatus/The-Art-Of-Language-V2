active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of enabling comprehensive compiler security flags (e.g.,
    -fstack-protector-all vs. -fstack-protector-strong) on performance and binary size in resource-constrained environments
    like embedded systems. Support arguments with real-world examples from OpenSSF guidelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the 6 objectives above]

  - Active Learning: Use for scenario-based cards (e.g., discussion trade-offs in analysis Qs).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers; tag each.

  - Prior Knowledge: Assume basic compilation/memory vulns; link in explanations.

  - Key Flags: GCC/Clang: -fstack-protector-strong/all, -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2, -Wl,-z,relro/now, -fPIE/-pie, -fsanitize=address/undefined/thread,
  -Wall -Wextra. MSVC: /GS, /DYNAMICBASE.

  - Concept Map: Use in relational cards.

  - Misconceptions: Integrate into distractors/explanations.

  Generate flashcards per schema: [paste schema above]. Ensure university pedagogy: Bloom''s progression, active recall, spaced
  repetition friendly (concise fronts, rich backs). High-quality: Accurate, verifiable (e.g., commands testable), engaging
  (real exploits). Output ONLY valid JSON array.'
