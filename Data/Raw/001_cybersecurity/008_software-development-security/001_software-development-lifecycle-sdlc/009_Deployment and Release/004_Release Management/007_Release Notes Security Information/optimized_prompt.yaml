active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Should release notes always publicly disclose all security vulnerabilities fixed in a release? Debate
    the pros (e.g., transparency aids rapid patching) and cons (e.g., risk of exploitation before patching), using real-world
    examples like the Equifax breach (unpatched Apache Struts) or SolarWinds supply chain attack.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 30 high-quality Anki-style flashcards optimized for university pedagogy. Integrate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert full layers above] – ensure coverage (7-8 cards per layer).

  - Active Learning: Draw from discussion (disclosure debates), peer teaching (OSPS/Vuln mgmt), problem-solving (incomplete
  notes scenarios) for scenario-based cards.

  - Voter Consensus: Emphasize completeness (CVE/CVSS/patch instructions, OSPS Vulnerability Management), prior knowledge
  (SDLC/vuln ID).

  - Research: Core concepts (release notes, vuln mgmt, Security Update Guide); OSPS Baseline (access/build/doc/vuln categories);
  best practices (disclose fixes publicly with details); examples (Equifax/SolarWinds).


  Use Flashcard Schema:

  - Front: Question/prompt (MCQ: 4 options A-D).

  - Back: Answer | Explanation (pedagogical rationale, ref to objective/layer/Bloom''s) | Distractors rationale (if MCQ) |
  Metadata: Bloom''s|Layer|Hierarchy|Source.


  Ensure spaced repetition best practices: concise fronts, detailed backs. Varied types per schema. Active recall focus. No
  adult/offensive content. Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...''}].'
