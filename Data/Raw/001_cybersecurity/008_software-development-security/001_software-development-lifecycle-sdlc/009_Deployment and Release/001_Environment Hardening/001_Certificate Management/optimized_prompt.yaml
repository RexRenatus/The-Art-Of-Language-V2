active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a zero-trust deployment environment, debate the merits of CRL versus OCSP for certificate revocation.
    Consider real-world pitfalls like CRL distribution delays during DDoS attacks and how they impact MITM prevention. Support
    your position with evidence from NIST SP 800-57 or CA/B Forum BR.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Plausible misconceptions: e.g., confuse CA with RA (RA verifies, CA issues)'
    - 'Common pitfalls: e.g., ''CRL provides real-time status'' (false, OCSP does)'
    - 'Edge cases: e.g., expired vs. revoked certs'
    - 'Topic-specific: Mix SDLC terms like ''use cert-manager for code signing'' (wrong, for TLS/server certs)'
    - Ensure distractors are 70% correct-sounding but fail on key details
