active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the risks of using legacy TLS versions (e.g., TLS 1.0) versus modern TLS 1.3 in a legacy enterprise
    environment. Debate the balance between backward compatibility, security, and performance using RFC 9325 recommendations.
    Consider prerequisites like basic networking and cryptography.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - e.g., Confuse SSL with TLS, legacy ciphers (RC4 as ''secure''), wrong handshake steps (skip PFS), mixed-up versions
    (TLS 1.0 as ''modern'').

    - Ensure distractors are realistic (from weak configs) but incorrect; explain why wrong on back.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator synthesizing university-level pedagogy for ''TLS/SSL Configuration''
  (Category: Cybersecurity; Domain: Software Development Security; Subdomain: SDLC; Entry: 009_Deployment and Release > Environment
  Hardening).


  **Prior Knowledge:** Basic networking (TCP/IP), introductory cryptography (symmetric/asymmetric encryption, PKI), SDLC phases
  (design/implementation security).


  **Big Picture Context:** TLS/SSL configuration hardens deployment environments in SDLC, preventing MITM attacks, ensuring
  data protection, and advancing cybersecurity maturity.


  **Sources:** NIST SP 800-52r2 (TLS Guidelines), OWASP TLS Cheat Sheet, Mozilla SSL Config Generator, RFC 9325 (TLS 1.3 guidance),
  SSL Labs, testssl.sh, Wireshark.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list from above].


  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** [Insert full active_learning from above] - Design cards prompting reflection on these (e.g.,
  ''How does this relate to hardening a weak config?'').
