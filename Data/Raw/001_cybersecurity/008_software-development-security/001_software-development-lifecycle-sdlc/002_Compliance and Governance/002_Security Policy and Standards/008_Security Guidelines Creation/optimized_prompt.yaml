active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the benefits and challenges of 'shift-left security' (integrating security
    early in SDLC via SSDF). Use examples from NIST SSDF practices to argue how it impacts development speed versus vulnerability
    reduction. Reference prior knowledge like the CIA triad and common vulnerabilities (e.g., injection flaws).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
