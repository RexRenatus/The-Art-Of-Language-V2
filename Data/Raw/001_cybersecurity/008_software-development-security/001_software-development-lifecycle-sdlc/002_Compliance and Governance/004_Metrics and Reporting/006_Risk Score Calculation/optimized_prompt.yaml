active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a software development project using Agile sprints, debate whether qualitative risk scoring (high/medium/low
    based on NIST CSF) or quantitative scoring (FAIR model with probabilistic frequencies) is better for prioritizing vulnerabilities
    during sprint planning, and justify using real-world trade-offs like speed vs. precision.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1. Common misconception (e.g., Risk = Impact only, ignoring likelihood).
    2. Confused terms (e.g., mix TEF with LM). 3. Edge case error (e.g., wrong formula like Risk = TEF + Vuln). Ensure plausible
    for cybersecurity/SDLC context, based on voter-noted gaps like incomplete FAIR understanding.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Software Development Security
  within the SDLC, Compliance and Governance (016_Metrics and Reporting). Topic: Risk Score Calculation. Topic Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > SDLC > 016_Compliance and Governance > Metrics and Reporting > Risk Score
  Calculation.


  Voter Consensus (68.6% approval): Emphasize complete FAIR model (Risk = LEF × LM; LEF = TEF × Vulnerability; LM factors),
  NIST CSF comparison, formulas, SDLC examples.
