  discussion_prompt: Discuss which OWASP API Security Top 10 risk (e.g., Broken Object Level Authorization or Broken Authentication)
    poses the greatest threat to modern microservices architectures. Support your view with examples from recent breaches
    (e.g., reference real-world incidents like those reported by OWASP or news sources) and debate mitigation strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    must be plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse REST statelessness with SOAP; mix up BOLA with FL authorization;

  \ voter consensus (100% approval): Complete OWASP API Security Top 10 with descriptions/testing techniques; add API testing\
  \ methods (auth, input validation, rate limiting, OWASP Top 10 tests); tools (Postman, Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP); scaffolding\
  \ layers; Bloom's objectives; prior knowledge links (HTTP, SDLC); problem-solving.\n\nResearch context: Use OWASP.org (API\
