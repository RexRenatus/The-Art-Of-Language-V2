  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate which OWASP API Top 10 risk (e.g., API1:2023 BOLA vs. API10:2023 Unsafe
    Consumption of APIs) poses the greatest threat to modern microservices architectures. Support your position with real-world
    breach examples (e.g., from OWASP case studies) and evaluate mitigation trade-offs in terms of development cost vs. security
    gain.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse BOLA with property-level
    auth). 2) Similar-sounding risk (e.g., Broken Auth for Function Level). 3) Outdated/older OWASP term (e.g., from Web Top
    10). Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter consensus errors (e.g., mixing authorization types) and web research
    pitfalls. Test distractors for ~70% trickiness (not obvious wrongs).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in OWASP API Top 10 (2023).
  Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > SDLC > 016_Emerging Technologies and Threats > 006_API
  Security > OWASP API Top 10. Ensure 100% completeness: Cover ALL 10 risks with descriptions, examples, mitigations (API1:2023
  BOLA - direct object access bypass; API2:2023 Broken Authentication - weak sessions/JWT; API3:2023 Broken Object Property
  Level Auth; API4:2023 Unrestricted Resource Consumption - DoS via queries; API5:2023 Broken Function Level Auth - admin
  funcs exposed; API6:2023 Unrestricted Sensitive Flows - scraping; API7:2023 SSRF - internal scans; API8:2023 Security Misconfiguration
  - defaults exposed; API9:2023 Improper Inventory - shadow APIs; API10:2023 Unsafe Consumption - no validation).


  Incorporate pedagogy: Bloom''s objectives (remember list, understand impacts, apply to scenarios, analyze/compare, evaluate
  mitigations, create designs). Use 4-layer scaffolding: Layer1 Foundation (terms), Layer2 Components (full list + concept
  map desc), Layer3 Implementation (mitigations/tools like OAuth, rate-limiters), Layer4 Integration (SDLC/DevSecOps). Active
  learning hints: Tie cards to discussions (e.g., ''Debate criticality''), peer-teach (e.g., ''Explain to peer''), problem-solving
  (scenarios).


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (10 per Bloom''s level pair: Remember/Understand, Apply/Analyze, Evaluate/Create x2
  for coverage). Use exact schema: For each card, output JSON: {''type'': ''Q&A|MCQ|Scenario|etc.'', ''front'': ''Question
  text'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''... (50-100w, Bloom tie-in, example, mitigation, links)'', ''related'':
  [''risks/SDLC phase'']}, ''scaffolding_layer'': ''1-4'', ''bloom_level'': ''Remember|etc.''}. Distractors: Follow protocol
  (misconceptions, similars, outdated). Sources: Link OWASP official (e.g., https://owasp.org/API-Security/). Optimize for
  Anki/Quizlet: Concise, active recall. Vary difficulty progressively.'
