  discussion_prompt: In a debate format, argue whether code obfuscation provides sufficient protection against reverse engineering
    in mobile apps or if it merely delays inevitable breaches. Use real-world examples like famous app hacks (e.g., banking
    apps cracked via deobfuscation) and reference tools like DexGuard or SwiftShield to support your position.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per card:

    - Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., ''obfuscation = encryption'').

    - Distractor 2: Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''ProGuard handles native code'' - it doesn''t).

    - Distractor 3: Confusable similar concept/platform (e.g., mix Android/iOS tools).

    Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter priorities (e.g., tool limitations, platform differences) and research
    (e.g., performance trade-offs).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Mobile Code Obfuscation''
  (Category: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > SDLC > 016_Emerging Technologies and Threats > Mobile 008_Application
  Security > Mobile Code Obfuscation). Generate 25-35 high-quality MCQ flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet, spanning Bloom''s
  Taxonomy (remember/understand: 30%, apply/analyze: 40%, evaluate/create: 30%).


  **Incorporate these exactly:**

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the array above].

  - Active Learning: Inspire higher-level cards with debate/peer teaching/problem-solving elements (e.g., evaluation cards
  reference real hacks).

  - Scaffolding Layers: Distribute coverage (Layer 1: 20%, Layer 2: 25%, Layer 3: 30%, Layer 4: 25%). Ensure completeness:
  Android (ProGuard/R8/DexGuard: shrinking/renaming/optimization/string encryption/control flow), iOS (SwiftShield/Obfuscator-LLVM:
  symbol renaming/bogus CF), limitations/best practices/examples (banking apps).

  - Voter Priorities: Clarity, progression, platform details, pedagogy.

  - Research: Obfuscation obscures (not encrypts) code; advantages (attack cost, IP/data protection); techniques deter RE.
