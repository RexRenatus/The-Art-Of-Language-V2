active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a team using React (a specific framework), how would you adapt OWASP Secure Coding Practices to prevent
    injection vulnerabilities during the implementation phase? Debate the trade-offs between security and development speed,
    considering real-world constraints like deadlines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Plausible but incorrect: Based on common misconceptions (e.g., ''Generic OWASP suffices without framework adaptation'').'
    - 'Frequency-based: Use OWASP Top 10 or NIST practices as distractors (e.g., confuse PW.5 static analysis with RV.1 response).'
    - '3 distractors per MCQ: 1 semi-correct (partial truth), 1 opposite/extreme, 1 unrelated.'
    - Avoid 'all/none' options; ensure 25% correct chance.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for educational content on ''Framework-Specific Security Training''
  in Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > SDLC > 001_Security Training and Culture > Developer Security Training.
  Consensus: 85.7% approval. Use voter-approved pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives, 4-layer scaffolding, active learning
  (discussion on React/OWASP injection trade-offs, peer teaching NIST SSDF/OWASP ASVS, problem-solving code refactor), prior
  knowledge (SDLC basics, OWASP Top 10), formative assessments.


  Core content from research: SSDLC vs SDLC; OWASP Secure Coding Practices (https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/);
  NIST SSDF (PO/PS/PW/RV: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/218/final); OWASP ASVS (https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/);
  framework adaptations (e.g., React XSS prevention).


  Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM JSON]. Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL LAYERS FROM JSON]. Active Learning:
  [INSERT FULL FROM JSON].


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (10-15 per layer, balanced types: 40% MCQ, 20% definition, 20% application, 20% analysis).
  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: JSON array of objects with ''front'', ''back'' (including explanation, source, Bloom''s
  level, layer), ''type''. Distractors per protocol. Ensure measurable, active recall, spaced repetition friendly. Vary difficulty
  progressively. Output ONLY valid JSON array.'
