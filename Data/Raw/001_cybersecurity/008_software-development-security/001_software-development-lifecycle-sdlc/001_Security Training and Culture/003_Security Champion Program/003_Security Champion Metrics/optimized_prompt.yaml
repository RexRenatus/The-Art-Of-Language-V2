  discussion_prompt: 'Debate: Are quantitative metrics like ''number of champions trained'' or ''security issues resolved
    per sprint'' sufficient for Security Champion Programs, or should qualitative measures of cultural impact (e.g., developer
    feedback on security awareness) be prioritized? Use NIST SP 800-55 examples and real-world DevSecOps scenarios to support
    arguments.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: '1. Semantic similarity: Swap key terms (e.g., ''behavioral'' vs ''technical''). 2. Partial truth:
    Correct concept wrong context (e.g., NIST SP 800-53 instead of 800-55). 3. Common errors: Overemphasis on quantity vs
    quality, ignore SDLC integration. Ensure distractors are plausible for cybersecurity learners.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert educational flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity topics, using university pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding) and best practices for spaced repetition (active recall, concise fronts,
  explanatory backs). Generate flashcards for ''Security Champion Metrics'' in Cybersecurity > Software Development Security
  > SDLC > 001_Security Training and Culture > Security Champion Program > Security Champion Metrics.


  **Research Context (Completed):** Security Champion Metrics evaluate Security Champion Programs (dev liaisons promoting
  security in SDLC). NIST SP 800-55 (Vols 1&2) guides measurement of controls/policies, tailored to risks. Examples: # champions
  trained, training completion rates, # sessions led by champions, % code reviews with security input, secure coding adoption
  rates, % teams with active champions, security issues resolved per sprint, vuln reduction, defect detection rates, participation
  rates. Measures cultural shift in DevSecOps.


  **Instructions:**

  - Cover these exact learning objectives: [insert full list from JSON].

  - Progress via scaffolding layers: [insert full scaffolding from JSON].

  - Inspire from active learning: [insert summaries of discussion/peer/problem-solving].

  - Anchor to prior knowledge: SDLC phases, Security Champion basics, KPI tracking.

  - Output ONLY a JSON array of 25-35 flashcards strictly following the schema: [insert full schema details].

  - Variety: 40% Foundation/Components (early layers), 60% Implementation/Integration. Balance Bloom''s.

  - High-quality: Concise (front <20 words), accurate, engaging. Explanations link to NIST/SDLC/DevSecOps. No hints on fronts.'
