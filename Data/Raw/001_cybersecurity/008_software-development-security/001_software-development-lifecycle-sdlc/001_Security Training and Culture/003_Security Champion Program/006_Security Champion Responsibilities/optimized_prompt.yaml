  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how Security Champions can balance advocating for security practices (e.g.,
    secure code reviews) with maintaining development velocity in an Agile SDLC. Use real-world examples from OWASP SAMM to
    support arguments and identify potential trade-offs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors that are: 1. Superficially similar (e.g., confuse Champion with security engineer
    duties). 2. Based on partial truths (e.g., ''Only handles firewalls'' vs. SDLC focus). 3. Common pitfalls (e.g., overemphasize
    one phase). Ensure 1 best answer.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Software Development Security.\
  \ Topic: Security Champion Responsibilities (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > SDLC > 001_Security\
  \ Training and Culture > Security Champion Program > Responsibilities). Use this COMPLETE content (synthesized from OWASP.org,\
  \ voter consensus 100% approval, research):\n\n**Foundation (Layer 1):** Definitions: Security Champion (dev team liaison\
  \ for security); Program (distributes security); Culture (shared behaviors). Concept Map: 'Responsibilities' → Evangelize,\
  \ Standards, Activities, Lifecycle; → SDLC phases, OWASP SAMM Governance/Culture.\n\n**Components (Layer 2):** Responsibilities:\
  \ 1. Evangelize awareness/training. 2. Promote standards (secure coding). 3. Facilitate activities (threat modeling via\
  \ STRIDE). 4. Oversee SDLC: Design (threat models), Develop (SAST/DAST code reviews—assist identifying/fixing issues, ensure\
  \ standards), Test (security testing), Deploy (secure configs, scans).\n\n**Implementation (Layer 3):** Steps e.g., Code\
  \ Review: Run SAST, triage, collaborate fixes. Deployment: Automate IaC scans.\n\n**Integration (Layer 4):** Full SDLC embedding,\
  \ SAMM maturity, metrics (vuln reduction), cross-team scaling.\n\n**Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives above].\n\
  \n**Active Learning Tie-ins:** Reference discussions (e.g., balance security/velocity), peer teaching, scenarios in explanations.\n\
  \nGenerate 50 high-quality flashcards following this EXACT schema per card:\n```json\n{\n  \"front\": \"Question text (MCQ\

  \ Balance: Layers evenly, Bloom's progression. Ensure completeness (all responsibilities, SDLC phases). Output as JSON array\
  \ of 50 cards."
