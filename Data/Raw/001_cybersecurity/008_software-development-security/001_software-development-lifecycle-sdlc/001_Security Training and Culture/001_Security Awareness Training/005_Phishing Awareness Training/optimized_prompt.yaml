active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''AI-enhanced phishing makes traditional awareness training
    obsolete.'' Use examples from CISA guidance and NIST standards to support your position, considering impacts on software
    development teams handling sensitive code repositories.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truth (e.g., similar tactic but wrong type), 3) Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., ''All urgent emails are phishing'').
    Ensure plausibility to promote critical thinking; avoid obvious wrongs.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Phishing Awareness Training
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > SDLC > 001_Security Training and Culture > Security Awareness
  Training > Phishing Awareness Training). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Spaced Repetition using
  university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, 4-layer scaffolding (Foundation: definitions/types; Components:
  tactics/indicators/standards; Implementation: checklists/simulations; Integration: SDLC/AI links). Incorporate research:
  Phishing/social engineering (NIST), types (spear/whaling/vishing), tactics (urgency/AI deepfakes, CISA ''Stop.Think.Connect.''),
  best practices (simulations, metrics), sources (NIST SP 800-50/177, CISA.gov, OWASP).


  Learning Objectives: [Insert full list from above]. Active Learning: Tie cards to discussion/peer/problem-solving (e.g.,
  scenario cards). Prior knowledge: Builds on basic hygiene/threats.


  Use exact schema: JSON array of flashcards. Each: {''front'': ''Question'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''... (ref sources/Bloom/SDLC)'', ''distractors'': [''A'', ''B'', ''C'']}, ''bloom_level'': ''Remember'', ''layer'': 1,
  ''type'': ''MCQ''}. Distractors per protocol. Balance: 10 cards/layer, span Bloom''s. Ensure engaging, measurable, comprehensive
  for SDLC devs building human firewall.'
