active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In your view, what are the top three barriers to building a security culture in a fast-paced software
    development team, and how can they be overcome? Debate using real-world examples like the Equifax breach, addressing the
    misconception that culture is just 'training'.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full list above]

  - Active Learning: [reference activities for links]

  - Scaffolding: Prior knowledge (Security Awareness Training); Concept Map [description]; 4 Layers [full details].


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following the Flashcard Schema exactly:

  - Mix types for Bloom''s progression.

  - Ensure scaffolding coverage (5-7 per layer).

  - Distractors per protocol.

  - Make measurable/active (e.g., ''List 3 components'' for recall).

  - Output ONLY valid JSON array: [{''front'': ''Q'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''A'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''references'':
