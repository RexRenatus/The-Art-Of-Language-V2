      "question_text": "Why is it important for commercial software to be 'Secure by Design' rather than relying solely on post-release patching?",

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Secure by Design is paramount because it proactively addresses security flaws during development, which is more efficient and effective than reactive patching. Therefore, it fundamentally reduces the attack surface and the need for frequent, potentially disruptive updates.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors focus on user patching complexity, an impossible guarantee of zero vulnerabilities, or vendor cost-saving motives, rather than the core benefits of proactive security integration in the development lifecycle.",
