active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given recent supply chain attacks like SolarWinds, debate whether organizations should adopt automatic
    patching for commercial software updates or require staged rollouts with testing. Consider trade-offs in speed, risk,
    and compliance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions:

    - D1: Overly simplistic/common error (e.g., ''Updates always improve security'' ignoring breaking changes).

    - D2: Confusable related concept (e.g., mix SBOM with BOM from manufacturing).

    - D3: Extreme/opposite view (e.g., ''Never update COTS to avoid risks''). Ensure distractors are realistic from voter
    misconceptions or real-world errors (e.g., ignoring SBOM in supply chain).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert educational flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity topics, using university-style
  pedagogy (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Commercial
  Software Updates'' in the hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > SDLC > 015_Supply Chain Security >
  COTS and Commercial Software > Commercial Software Updates.


  **Core Content Sources**: NIST SP 800-218 SSDF v1.1 (secure development), NIST SP 800-161r1-upd1 (supply chain), EO 14028;
  examples: SolarWinds, Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228).


  **Incorporate**:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use scenarios from discussion/peer/problem-solving for applied cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers (Foundation to Integration); include Prior Knowledge links.


  **Output ONLY 25-30 flashcards** strictly following the Flashcard Schema:

  Ensure completeness: Cover SBOM, DevSecOps, update lifecycle, risks/examples. Cards must promote active recall, spaced repetition.
  No additional text outside flashcards.'
