  **Content Context (Complete Research Summary):** SaaS Security Assessment evaluates risks in cloud-based software like Salesforce/Google
  Workspace. Key: Shared responsibility model (provider secures infrastructure, customer manages data/configs). SSPM for continuous
  monitoring. Frameworks: NIST CSF 2.0 (Govern: third-party risks), CSA CAIQ (control questionnaire), CSA STAR (assurance
  reports). Best Practices: 1) Gather vendor docs (CAIQ, SOC2); 2) Review responses for gaps; 3) Audit configs (IAM, MFA);
  4) Test app integrations; 5) Deploy SSPM for monitoring; 6) Remediate & report. Sources: NIST CSF (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework),
  CSA CAIQ/STAR (https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/), SSPM Guide (https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/saas-security-posture-management-sspm).


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Generate 50 flashcards progressing via scaffolding layers (Layer1: Foundation defs; Layer2: Frameworks;
  Layer3: Steps; Layer4: Integration/SDLC). Align to Bloom''s objectives: [insert learning_objectives array]. Incorporate
  active learning hooks (e.g., reference Okta debate).


  **Generation Rules:**

  - 50 flashcards total, balanced by Bloom''s/scaffolding.

  - Use schema: Front || Answer | Explanation (cite framework/source/example) | Bloom | Layer | Distractors (if MCQ).

  - Distractors: Follow protocol for MCQs (40% of cards).

  - Ensure university rigor: Active recall, spaced repetition optimized.

  - Output as numbered list in Anki format.
