active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the limitations of relying solely on vendor security certifications (e.g.,
    ISO/IEC 27001 or SOC 2 Type II) for COTS software procurement. Consider real-world incidents like SolarWinds or Log4j—do
    certifications prevent such risks, or are additional measures needed? Support arguments with NIST SP 800-161 or SSDF references.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    cards as MCQ, 60% Q&A.'

  \ cards across 4 layers: [Insert scaffolding array here]. Tag each card with layer.\n- Voter Priorities: Ensure completeness\
  \ (NIST SP 800-218 full: 'core set of high-level secure software development practices... common vocabulary'); list/explain\
  \ certs (ISO/IEC 27001, SOC 2 Type II, FedRAMP Moderate/High, CSA STAR, PCI DSS); steps; prior knowledge (SDLC phases, supply\
  \ chain risks); concept map; big picture (SolarWinds/Log4j).\n- Research: C-SCRM (NIST 800-161), SSDF (800-218), NIST CSF\
  \ 2.0.\n\nGenerate 50-75 flashcards following this exact schema per card:\n{\n  'id': 1,\n  'type': 'Definition|List|Explanation|Application|Comparison|Evaluation|Synthesis',\n\

  \ Balance: 40% MCQ with distractors (plausible via protocol: semantic/common error/partial truth). Ensure active recall,\
  \ no hints on front. High pedagogical value: explanations reinforce objectives/scaffolding."
