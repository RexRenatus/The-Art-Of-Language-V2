active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between comprehensive security clauses (e.g., mandatory
    penetration testing) and vendor flexibility in SaaS contracts. Use the SolarWinds attack as a case study to argue for
    or against stricter clauses.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    only for hardware''); 2) Partial truth (e.g., NIST but wrong version); 3) Related but off-topic (e.g., GDPR instead of
    NIST). Ensure distractors test nuance from standards like ITSM.50.104 vs. OWASP.'

  Topic: Contract Security Clauses (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > SDLC > 015_Supply Chain Security
  > Third-Party 002_Risk Management > Contract Security Clauses). Use this COMPLETE research context:


  Core Concepts: Contract Security Clauses define cybersecurity expectations in software contracts (e.g., secure SDLC, SCI).
  Key terms: SDLC, CSP, SCI.

  Standards: NIST SP 800-161r1 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-161r1, 2022: Supply chain risk mgmt practices); OWASP
  Secure Software Contract Annex (https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-software-contract-annex/, clauses for dev security);
  Canadian Centre for Cyber Security ITSM.50.104 (https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/it-security-clauses-contracts-itsm50104,
  2023: Mandates clauses for IT contracts on controls, audits, reporting).

  Examples: SolarWinds (supply chain breach due to weak clauses); SaaS SLAs (pentest rights).

  Sources: NIST (above), OWASP (above), Cyber Centre (above), CISA Supply Chain (https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-supply-chain-security).
