active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether escrow agreements sufficiently mitigate supply chain risks in cybersecurity
    or if additional measures like continuous monitoring are needed. Use real-world examples from vendor bankruptcy cases,
    such as the Code Spaces incident in 2014 where lack of source access led to total loss, or Nortel bankruptcy where escrow
    enabled continuity for some customers.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Research Context:** Escrow agreements are tripartite contracts where a software vendor (licensor) deposits source code,
  docs, credentials with a neutral escrow agent, released to licensee on trigger events (bankruptcy, acquisition, support
  failure, abandonment). Supports business continuity and IP protection. Verification: Licensee audits deposits periodically.
  Real-world: Code Spaces 2014 hack led to bankruptcy without escrow; Nortel 2009 bankruptcy allowed escrow holders continuity.
