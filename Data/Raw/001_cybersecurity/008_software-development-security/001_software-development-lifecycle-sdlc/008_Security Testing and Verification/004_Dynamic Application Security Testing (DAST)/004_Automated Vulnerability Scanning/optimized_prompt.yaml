active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of integrating automated vulnerability scanning into
    CI/CD pipelines for shift-left security. How does it balance speed of development with security risk reduction? Provide
    examples from FedRAMP ConMon scenarios.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., ''manual code review''). 2) Misplace in lifecycle (e.g., ''initial authorization only''). 3) Overstate role (e.g.,
    ''replaces all testing'', ''deploys patches''). 4) Unrelated (e.g., ''user access control''). Ensure 1-2 plausible, research-grounded
    distractors per card.'

  **Big Picture:** Automated scanning enables shift-left security in SDLC, identifies vulnerabilities proactively, key for
  FedRAMP ConMon (RA-5), NISTIR 8011 Vol. 4 (assessment procedures).


  **Research Context:** Vulnerability scanning: automated detection of weaknesses (CloudDefense.ai). Management cycle (OWASP.org).
  Functions: identify/prioritize/automate/comply (FedRAMP.gov). Tools: Nessus, OWASP ZAP.


  **Sources:** FedRAMP.gov (ConMon/Vuln Scanning), OWASP.org (Vuln Mgmt Guide), CloudDefense.ai (Guide), NISTIR 8011 Vol.
