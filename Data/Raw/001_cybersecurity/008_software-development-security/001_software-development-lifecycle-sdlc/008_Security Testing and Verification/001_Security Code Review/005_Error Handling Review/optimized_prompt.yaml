active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between providing detailed error messages for developer
    debugging during development versus generic, secure messages in production. How does this align with OWASP guidelines
    and SDLC phases? Support your arguments with examples from reconnaissance attacks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these learning objectives [insert learning_objectives array]. Use active learning for inspiration [insert active_learning
  object]. Follow 4-layer scaffolding [insert scaffolding object] to ensure progression.


  Key content from OWASP Developer Guide and research: Core concepts (error handling, exception handling, info leakage, secure
  failure). Best practices: Generic user messages, no stack traces to users, secure logging (no PII), handle specific exceptions,
  use finally for cleanup. Code examples: Insecure (expose e.printStackTrace()), Secure (log.error(e); send ''500 Internal
  Error''). Checklist: Scan for user-facing diagnostics, verify logging, test failure modes.


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet. Cover all Bloom''s levels and layers evenly. Use flashcard_schema
  [insert flashcard_schema object]: Output as JSON array of objects with ''front'' and ''back'' (nested object). Make questions
  active (e.g., ''Identify the risk in this code''). Include concrete Java/Python snippets. Ensure explanations reference
  OWASP/SDLC. Distractors must be realistic from voter-noted mistakes.'
