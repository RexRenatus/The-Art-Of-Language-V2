active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of implementing Security as Code in a legacy monolithic
    application versus a modern microservices architecture. Consider factors like tool maturity (e.g., OPA vs. Checkov), team
    skills, and compliance needs (NIST SSDF vs. SLSA). Provide evidence from real-world examples and propose mitigation strategies
    for identified challenges.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors that are plausible based on common misconceptions: 1) Semantic similar but
    imprecise (e.g., confuse SaC with IaC only); 2) Outdated/alternative approach (e.g., manual security); 3) Related but
    wrong context (e.g., Shift Right instead of Left). Ensure distractors test nuance from standards like SLSA vs. OSPS.'
