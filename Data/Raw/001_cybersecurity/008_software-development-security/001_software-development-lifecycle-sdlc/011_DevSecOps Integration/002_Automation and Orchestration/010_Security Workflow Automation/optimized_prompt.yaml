active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of full security automation vs. human-in-the-loop in DevSecOps pipelines, using
    NIST CSF 2.0 and recent breaches like SolarWinds as cases. Consider impacts on speed, accuracy, and compliance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors based on common misconceptions: (1) Partial truths (e.g., confuse SOAR with SIEM),
    (2) Outdated concepts (e.g., manual vs. automated SDLC), (3) Related but wrong terms (e.g., DevOps instead of DevSecOps),
    (4) Edge cases (e.g., ignore maturity levels). Ensure plausibility from voter/research context (e.g., misattribute tools
    like Jenkins to non-security tasks).'
