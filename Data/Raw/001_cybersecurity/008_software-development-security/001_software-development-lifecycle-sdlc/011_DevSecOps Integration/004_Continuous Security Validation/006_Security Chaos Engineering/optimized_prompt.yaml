active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In groups, debate the ethical and practical challenges of running SCE experiments in production environments
    versus staging. How does SCE align with NIST CSF's 'Detect' and 'Respond' functions? Reference real-world examples from
    tools like Gremlin.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
