active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of prioritizing Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR) versus SAST
    code coverage metrics in a high-velocity DevSecOps environment. How do these align with NIST CSF 2.0 outcomes, and what
    risks arise if automation is neglected?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
