active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a debate format, argue whether biometric authentication should replace traditional passwords in high-security
    environments like banking apps. Groups should address security benefits, privacy risks, accessibility for diverse users,
    and ethical implications such as data breaches or consent.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    templates); 2) Related but incorrect terms (e.g., ''1:N for verification''); 3) Edge cases or opposites (e.g., high FAR
    as ''low security risk''); Ensure plausibility from research context to promote active recall and error correction.'

  **Expanded Research Context (Complete and Web-Grounded):**

  Biometric authentication uses unique physiological (fingerprints, facial/iris recognition, palm veins) or behavioral (keystroke
  dynamics, gait, signature) traits for identity verification. Key processes: Enrollment (capture multiple samples → feature
  extraction → secure template storage); Authentication (live sample → matching → decision). Verification=1:1, Identification=1:N.
  Components: sensor, extractor, matcher, decision engine. Risks: spoofing (photos/masks), replay attacks, FAR (false accept)/FRR
  (false reject) trade-offs. Mitigations: liveness detection, encryption/FHE for templates, multi-modal fusion. Standards:
  NIST SP 800-63-4 (digital identity guidelines, AAL levels), SP 800-76 (biometric info criteria), SP 800-63B (authenticators);
  ISO/IEC 19794 (data formats); FIDO2/WebAuthn for integration. Privacy: GDPR (consent, minimization, no raw data storage).
  SDLC best practices: threat modeling in design, secure coding in implementation, testing for FAR/FRR.

  **Active Learning Inspiration:** Use to inspire scenario cards: [Insert active_learning object from above].


  **Flashcard Generation:** Create 45 flashcards covering all layers (10-12 each) and objectives (balanced). Follow exact
  schema: {front, back, distractors: [], explanation, metadata: {bloom_level, layer, tags: []}}. Output as JSON array of objects.
  Vary formats for active recall. Ensure completeness, accuracy, and distractors per protocol. Promote critical thinking on
  trade-offs (security vs. privacy). Sources: NIST.gov/sp800-63-4, ISO.org, FIDOalliance.org.'
