active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios would Mandatory Access Control (MAC) be preferable to Discretionary Access Control
    (DAC) in a high-security environment like a government agency or hospital? Debate the trade-offs in terms of security,
    usability, and administrative overhead, considering real-world examples such as SELinux or military systems.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (30% of cards): Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g., ''Users
    can change permissions'' for MAC vs. DAC confusion; RBAC roles mistaken for labels; ''read up allowed'' inverting Bell-LaPadula).
    Ensure distractors are realistic from research context or voter notes. Mark correct answer clearly.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Topic: Mandatory Access Control (MAC) in Cybersecurity > Software Development
  Security > SDLC > 005_Implementation and Development > Access Control Implementation.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active learning: Use discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving as context for application cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers: [INSERT FULL LAYER DESCRIPTIONS FROM ABOVE].

  - Research: MAC = central label-based control (labels, clearances, need-to-know); Bell-LaPadula (no read up, no write down);
  examples: SELinux, AppArmor. Comparison table: [INSERT TABLE FROM LAYER 4]. Prior knowledge: Builds on DAC (central vs.
  user control).

  - Big picture: Critical for SDLC implementation to prevent leaks in classified systems.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following this schema exactly: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD_SCHEMA FROM ABOVE].

  Ensure completeness: Cover comparisons (MAC/DAC/RBAC/ABAC), real-world examples, pros/cons, misconceptions. Cards must be
  optimized for spaced repetition: concise fronts, rich backs. Output ONLY the JSON array of flashcards.'
