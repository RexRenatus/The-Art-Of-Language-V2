active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given the emphasis on speed in modern DevOps practices, debate whether comprehensive security design
    documentation (e.g., threat models and architecture diagrams per NIST SSDF) should be mandatory in every sprint or only
    for high-risk features. Support your position with examples from real-world breaches like SolarWinds.
  peer_teaching: Pair students; one explains core components of security design docs (threat models, security requirements
    specs, controls from NIST 800-53) using a simple app example (e.g., e-commerce site), then switch roles for teach-back
    with peer-generated examples. Addresses misconceptions that docs are just paperwork.
  problem_solving: Provide a flawed sample security design doc for a fictional cloud service. Students identify gaps (e.g.,
    missing vulnerability mitigations), propose fixes using ISM guidelines and NIST SP 800-218, and create a revised diagram.
    Real-world application via breach case studies like Equifax.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security Design Documentation
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > SDLC > 004_Design and Architecture > Security Design Review
  > Security Design Documentation). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (cover all 6 levels via objectives), active
  learning (inspire via discussion/peer/problem-solving), 4-layer scaffolding (Foundation: defs; Components: standards like
  NIST SSDF SP 800-218, NIST 800-53 Rev5, ISM; Implementation: steps; Integration: DevSecOps links). Sources: NIST SSDF [https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/218/r1_1/final],
