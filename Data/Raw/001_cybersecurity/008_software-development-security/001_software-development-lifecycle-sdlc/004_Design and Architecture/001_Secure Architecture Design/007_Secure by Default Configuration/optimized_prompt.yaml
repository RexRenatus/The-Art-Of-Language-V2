active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs between security, usability, and development cost in implementing Secure by Default
    configurations. Debate using real-world examples like the Equifax breach (insecure defaults contributing to vulnerability)
    or Apple's App Transport Security (secure defaults enforcing HTTPS).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    over security''), 2) Partial truths (e.g., mix Secure by Design with Secure by Default), 3) Real-world failures twisted
    positively (e.g., Mirai-style defaults as ''convenient''), 4) Edge cases (e.g., over-secure defaults impacting performance
    without trade-off mention). Ensure distractors promote analysis.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  using Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, and scaffolding. Generate 25 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Secure by
  Default Configuration'' in the hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Development Lifecycle
  (SDLC) > 004_Design and Architecture > Secure Architecture Design > Secure by Default Configuration.


  **Research Context (Complete):** Secure by Default Configuration designs software to be secure out-of-the-box, minimizing
  user configuration needs (opposite: Vulnerable by Design). Related to Secure by Design (CISA.gov). Standards: NIST SP 800-218
  (SSDF: PO.4 secure deployment defaults), CISA Secure by Design principles, OWASP Secure Coding Practices, CIS Benchmarks.
  Examples: Failures - Mirai botnet (default passwords); Equifax (misconfigs). Successes - Apple ATS (HTTPS default), AWS
  security groups (deny inbound), modern routers (WPA3 enabled, firewalls on).

  ''source'': ''...'', ''tie_in'': ''Optional activity hint''}}. Follow flashcard_schema exactly. Ensure distractors per protocol.
  Prioritize voter consensus: completeness (full NIST/CISA coverage, examples), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression), engagement.'
