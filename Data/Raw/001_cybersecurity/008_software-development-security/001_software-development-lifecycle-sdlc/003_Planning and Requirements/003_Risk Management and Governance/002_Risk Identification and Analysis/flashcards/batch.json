      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "NIST SP 800-161 Rev. 1 emphasizes C-SCRM because organizations are increasingly reliant on external products and services, which can introduce risks from malicious functionality, counterfeits, or poor development practices. Therefore, managing these supply chain risks is critical for overall security.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors narrow the scope of C-SCRM to specific, limited activities like vendor certification, internal coding, or scanning, missing its comprehensive approach to managing risks across the entire supply chain.",
        "analogy": "C-SCRM is like thoroughly vetting all the suppliers and materials used to build a house, not just checking the electrical wiring, to ensure the entire structure is sound and free from hidden defects."

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Technical debt, which arises from taking shortcuts or making suboptimal design choices during development, increases the risk of security vulnerabilities because rushed or poorly structured code is harder to secure, maintain, and refactor safely later on.",
