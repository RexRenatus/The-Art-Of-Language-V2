  > SDLC > 002_Planning and Requirements > 002_002_Risk Management and Governance > Security Metrics and KPIs.


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > SDLC > 002_Planning and Requirements > 002_002_Risk Management
  and Governance > Security Metrics and KPIs.

  - Learning Objectives: [REMEMBER: Define metrics/KPIs/KRIs/ROSI], [UNDERSTAND: Role in SDLC], [APPLY: Select for phases],
  [ANALYZE: NIST vs custom], [EVALUATE: Critique sets], [CREATE: Design dashboards].

  - Scaffolding Layers: Layer 1 Foundation (definitions, concept map), Layer 2 Components (categories: Vuln Density, MTTR,
  % req risks, NIST), Layer 3 Implementation (steps in SDLC), Layer 4 Integration (business/DevSecOps).

  - Active Learning: Draw from discussions (KRIs vs KPIs), peer ROSI, KPI design, alignment role-play for scenario cards.

  - Content Sources: NIST SP 800-55, examples (MTTR, % SAST code, ROSI calcs), big picture (proactive DevSecOps).


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using this schema:

  1. Definition: {type, question, answer, explanation, source}

  2. MCQ: {type, question, correct_answer, distractors: [3], explanation, blooms_level}

  3. Application: {type, scenario_question, answer, explanation, distractors: [2-3]}

  4. Evaluation/Create: {type, prompt, model_answer, rubric, explanation}


  Balance: 30% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 40% Evaluate/Create. 50% MCQ with distractors (plausible misconceptions,
  e.g., confuse phases/metrics). Cover all layers/objectives. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects.'
