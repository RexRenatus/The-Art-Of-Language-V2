active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Using NIST CSF 2.0 Govern function, debate whether organizations should allocate more budget to third-party
    risk management or internal SDLC security practices in high-risk industries like finance. Provide justifications based
    on real-world attack examples (e.g., SolarWinds supply chain breach).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors for MCQs: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse Govern with Protect),
    2) Partial truth (e.g., related framework term), 3) Extreme/opposite (e.g., ''Unlimited budget'' vs. risk-based). Base
    on voter priorities, research context (e.g., SSDF truncation pitfalls like ignoring RV: Respond to Vulnerabilities), and
    real-world errors (e.g., over-allocating to Detect vs. Govern).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Software Development Security
  within the SDLC. Topic: ''Security Budget and Resource Allocation'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security
  > SDLC > 002_Planning and Requirements > 002_002_Risk Management and Governance > Security Budget and Resource Allocation).
  Voter consensus: 84.3% approval; prioritize completeness (expand NIST SP 800-218 SSDF: PO Prepare Organization [training/policies],
  PR Protect Software [tools/static analysis], PW Produce Well-Secured Software [design reviews], RV Respond to Vulnerabilities
  [patching/incident response]; resource allocation for these), pedagogy (Bloom''s objectives), scaffolding (4 layers).


  Core content (web-grounded): Security budget = financial allocation for cybersecurity (tools/personnel/training). Resource
  allocation = strategic distribution for SDLC security. NIST CSF 2.0: Govern function for risk oversight/resource alignment;
  functions: Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover. SSDF: Embed security via resourced practices. Sources: NIST CSF 2.0
  (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), SSDF (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/218/final).
