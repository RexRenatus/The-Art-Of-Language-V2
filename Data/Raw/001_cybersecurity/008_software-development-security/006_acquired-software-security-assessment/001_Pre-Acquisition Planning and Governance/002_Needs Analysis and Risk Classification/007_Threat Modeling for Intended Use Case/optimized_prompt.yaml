active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss how threat modeling for an intended use case (e.g., remote video conferencing with Zoom) differs
    from in-house software development, particularly in linking to pre-acquisition risk classification. Identify the top two
    STRIDE threats and justify their relevance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
