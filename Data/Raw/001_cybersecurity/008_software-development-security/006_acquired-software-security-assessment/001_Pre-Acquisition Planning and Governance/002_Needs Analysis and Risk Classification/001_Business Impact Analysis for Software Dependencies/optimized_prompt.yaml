active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In groups, debate the criticality of software dependencies in a hypothetical e-commerce platform. Categorize
    dependencies (e.g., payment gateway API vs. analytics library) and compare/contrast their business impacts during a cyber
    disruption. Use NIST CSF 'Identify' function to frame arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
