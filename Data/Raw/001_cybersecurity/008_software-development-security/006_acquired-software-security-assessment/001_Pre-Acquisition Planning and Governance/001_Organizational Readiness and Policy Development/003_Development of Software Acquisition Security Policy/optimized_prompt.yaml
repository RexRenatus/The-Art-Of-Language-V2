active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In light of recent supply chain attacks like SolarWinds, debate whether organizations should prioritize
    C-SCRM in software acquisition policies even if it increases procurement costs by 20-30%. What trade-offs are acceptable?
    Consider efficiency, compliance, and long-term risk reduction.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions:

    - Confuse C-SCRM with general risk management (e.g., ''Only financial risks'').

    - Overlook third-party/supply chain (e.g., ''Security only post-deployment'').

    - Ignore standards (e.g., ''No need for NIST in small orgs'').

    - Exaggerate costs vs. benefits (e.g., ''Skip audits to save 20-30%''). Ensure distractors are realistic, stem from research/voter
    inputs, and teach via explanation.'
