active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given the 'assume breach' mindset, debate the trade-offs of implementing strict network isolation during
    software deployment versus maintaining development agility. Reference NIST SP 800-207 Zero Trust Architecture principles
    (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/207/final) and provide real-world examples like the SolarWinds breach where lack of
    isolation enabled lateral movement.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    guidelines: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ (20% of cards). Base on 5 common misconceptions: 1) Network isolation
      hinders performance more than it helps security (distractor: overemphasize perf cost). 2) It''s only for production
      environments (ignore dev/test). 3) VLANs provide complete isolation alone (no need for firewalls). 4) Trusted vendor
      software needs no isolation (assume breach ignored). 5) ZTA eliminates network isolation (confuses verification with
      segmentation). Use partial truths, opposites, or unrelated concepts.'
    variety: 'Mix formats: 40% Q&A, 30% MCQ, 20% Cloze, 10% Higher-order (scenario-based from activities).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert cybersecurity educator and flashcard generator specializing in Software Development Security.
  Generate 25 high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for the topic ''Network Isolation During Deployment'' (Category: Cybersecurity;
  Domain: Software Development Security; Subdomain: Acquired Software Security Assessment; Entry: 011_Deployment and Operational
  Security; Entry Subdomain: Secure Installation and Configuration). Use the provided research context: Network isolation
  segments networks to limit breach blast radius and prevent lateral movement; key terms: least privilege, assume breach,
  ZTA (NIST SP 800-207: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/207/final). Incorporate voter consensus: practical examples (VLANs,
  subnets, firewalls, microsegmentation, AWS VPCs, Azure VNets), concept map (Network Isolation → prevents Lateral Movement,
  enables ZTA, enforces Least Privilege; phases: dev/test/prod), misconceptions for distractors.


  Learning Objectives (Bloom''s progression): [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE].

  Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT scaffolding OBJECT HERE] – Generate ~5-6 cards per layer, progressing from basic recall to integration.

  Active Learning Integration: Include 4-5 higher-order cards inspired by [discussion_prompt], [peer_teaching_activity], [problem_solving_exercise]
  (e.g., ''Debate-style: Evaluate trade-offs in this scenario...'').


  Strictly follow Flashcard Schema: [INSERT flashcard_schema HERE]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcards, each as: {"front":
  "...", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "distractors_explained": "..." (if MCQ), "related_activity": "...",
  "bloom_level": "...", "layer": "..."}}. Ensure accuracy, engagement, and pedagogical depth for university-level learners.'
