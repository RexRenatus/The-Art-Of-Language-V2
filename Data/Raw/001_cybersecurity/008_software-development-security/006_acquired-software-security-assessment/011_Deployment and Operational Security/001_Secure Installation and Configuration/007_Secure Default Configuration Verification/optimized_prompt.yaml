active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, analyze how insecure default configurations contributed to major breaches like
    SolarWinds Orion (weak admin defaults) and Equifax (unpatched/misconfigured components). Contrast with secure defaults
    in services like AWS or Azure. What preventive measures could have been implemented, and how does this tie into NIST SSDF
    practices?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MC card: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse verification with patching);
    2) Partial truth (e.g., mentions tool but wrong phase); 3) Extreme/opposite (e.g., ''no verification needed''). Ensure
    plausible for learners at intermediate level. Mark correct answer in front with ''A/B/C/D''.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university pedagogy (Bloom''s
  Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Secure Default Configuration Verification''
  (Category: Cybersecurity; Domain: Software Development Security; Subdomain: Acquired Software Security Assessment; Entry:
  011_Deployment and Operational Security; Entry Subdomain: Secure Installation and Configuration).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the full list from learning_objectives above].

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste the full scaffolding array above; ensure 25% cards per layer].

  - Active Learning Ties: Reference discussion examples (SolarWinds, Equifax), tools (CIS benchmarks, SCAP), and exercises
  in explanations.

  - Best Practices: Verification steps (audit docs, scan with SCAP/CIS-CAT, disable services, peer review); SDLC integration
  (CI/CD gates); NIST SP 800-218 SSDF (PO.7 risk analysis, SC.5 secure defaults).


  Output EXCLUSIVELY a JSON array of 50 flashcards following this exact schema: [paste full flashcard_schema.card_structure
  above].

  - Cover all Bloom''s levels and layers proportionally.

  - For MC: 4 options (A/B/C/D), front includes full question + options, back = ''Correct: [letter]. [answer]''.

  - Explanations: Tie to objectives/layers, include sources (e.g., NIST SP 800-218: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-218.pdf;
  CIS: https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks).

  - Distractors: Strictly follow protocol.

  - Optimize for Anki/Quizlet: Concise fronts, rich backs.

  No intro text, no other output.'
