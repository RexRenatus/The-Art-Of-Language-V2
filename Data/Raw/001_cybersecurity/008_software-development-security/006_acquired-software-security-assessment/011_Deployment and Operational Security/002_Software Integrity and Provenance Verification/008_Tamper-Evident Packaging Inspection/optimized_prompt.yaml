active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains a standard (e.g., SLSA levels or in-toto attestations) while the other demonstrates
    package inspection using tools like `cosign verify` or `syft` on a sample artifact; switch roles and provide feedback.
  problem_solving: Given a Docker image with potentially modified checksums (simulate tampering), analyze for integrity issues
    using hashes/signatures/SBOMs, propose fixes, and integrate into a CI/CD pipeline. Draw from XZ Utils backdoor as a case
    study.

    2) Partial truths (e.g., SLSA Level 1 as ''fully secure''). 3) Related but incorrect concepts (e.g., NIST Handbook 133
    for software). 4) Real-world pitfalls (e.g., SolarWinds unsigned vs. signed). Ensure distractors teach by contrast.'
