  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE]

  - Prior Knowledge: Builds on initial vendor assessments and basic TPRM.

  - Research Context: Organizations rely on vendors; periodic reassessments ensure alignment via TPRM. Key concepts: Vendor
  Security Review, Inherent/Profiled/Residual Risks. Crucial due to evolving threats (e.g., SolarWinds). Recommended: Risk-tiered
  schedules (high-risk quarterly), tools (questionnaires/audits), metrics (risk trends). Sources: upguard.com, cbh.com, panorays.com,
  NIST, SOC 2.
