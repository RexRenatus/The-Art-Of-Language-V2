      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "PAM secures the software supply chain because it governs and monitors access to critical infrastructure like build servers and repositories, preventing unauthorized modifications or insertions of malicious code, thereby protecting the integrity of the software delivery process.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly associate PAM with component encryption, IDE management, or code scanning, missing its core function of controlling and auditing access to the *systems* involved in the supply chain.",
        "analogy": "PAM securing the software supply chain is like controlling who has access to the factory floor, the assembly line machinery, and the loading docks, ensuring only authorized personnel can influence the product being built and shipped."
