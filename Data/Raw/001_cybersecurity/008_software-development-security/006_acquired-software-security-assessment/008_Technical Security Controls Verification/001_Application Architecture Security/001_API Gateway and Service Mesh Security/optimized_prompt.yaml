active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student teaches the other how a Service Mesh (e.g., Istio) enables mutual TLS (mTLS) for service-to-service
    communication without application code changes. Switch roles and provide teach-back feedback.
  problem_solving: Given an e-commerce microservices scenario (e.g., user service, payment service, inventory service), design
    a secure architecture integrating API Gateway for north-south traffic and Service Mesh for east-west traffic. Apply OWASP
    Microservices Security Cheat Sheet controls (e.g., authZ, rate limiting) and NIST guidelines; present and peer-review
    solutions.
