  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, analyze how audit trail tampering contributed to breaches like the 2014 Sony
    Pictures attack (where attackers wiped logs to cover tracks) or the Equifax incident. Debate: How would NIST AU-9 have
    mitigated these? Propose one enhancement to current standards.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    for advanced learners; tie explanations to NIST accuracy and voter suggestions.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 20-30 high-quality flashcards
  on ''Audit Trail Integrity and Tamper-Proofing'' (Topic Hierarchy: [''Cybersecurity'', ''Software Development Security'',
  ''Acquired Software Security Assessment'', ''008_Technical Security Controls Verification'', ''Logging, Monitoring, and
  Audit Controls'', ''Audit Trail Integrity and Tamper-Proofing'']). Integrate university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (distribute
  across all 6 levels), 4-layer scaffolding (Layer 1: definitions; Layer 2: NIST AU-9/AU-5 components; Layer 3: implementation
  steps like signatures/append-only; Layer 4: integration with zero-trust/SDLC/case studies like Sony 2014), active learning
  hooks (e.g., ''How would this apply in peer problem-solving?''), voter priorities (full AU-5 with alerts/remediation, big
  picture for trust/accountability, prior logging links, tamper methods), web research (NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 from csrc.nist.gov:
  audit trails as activity records, integrity via tamper-proofing).


  Big picture: Enables trust in acquired software, prevents tampering/insider threats, aids forensics in CISA/OWASP SDLC.


  OUTPUT ONLY a valid JSON array of flashcards matching the EXACT SCHEMA: each has ''question'' (string), ''answer'' (string),
  ''distractors'' (array of 3 {text, explanation}), ''explanation'' (detailed, pedagogical), ''bloom_level'' (REMEMBER|UNDERSTAND|APPLY|ANALYZE|EVALUATE|CREATE),
  ''topic_hierarchy'' (exact array above). No extra text. Validate: 3 distractors each, all fields present, misconception-based
  distractors, scaffolding progression, accurate NIST (e.g., AU-9 protects info, AU-5 responds to failures with alerts). Ensure
  100% schema compliance.'
