active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the tension between a vendor's intellectual property rights and a buyer's need for comprehensive
    security testing (e.g., penetration testing, vulnerability assessments) in acquisition contracts. Reference NIST SP 800-115,
    real-world examples like the SolarWinds breach, and balance risks with legal compliance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    SP 800-115 phases, distractors: ''Planning only'' (too narrow), ''Compliance auditing'' (confuses with SP 800-53A), ''Post-attack
    first'' (wrong order). Ensure distractors are realistic (e.g., mix up docs like 800-115 vs 800-53) but identifiable via
    explanations. No more than 1 fully incorrect/random distractor.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)²-aligned topics.\
  \ Generate high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized flashcards for '010_Security Testing and Assessment Rights' (Category:\
  \ Cybersecurity; Domain: Software Development Security; Subdomain: Acquired Software Security Assessment; Entry: 003_Contract\
  \ and Legal Requirements > Security Requirements in Agreements; Level 6 topic).\n\nIncorporate these pedagogical elements:\n\
  - **Learning Objectives** (span Bloom's): [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE].\n- **Active Learning**: Tie flashcards to discussion\
  \ (IP vs testing rights, SolarWinds), peer teaching (NIST 800-53A teach-back), problem-solving (contract gap analysis).\n\
  - **Scaffolding** (4 layers): [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING DETAILS FROM ABOVE]. Generate ~10-15 cards per layer, progressing\
  \ from foundation to integration.\n- **Research Context**: NIST SP 800-115 (testing guide: planning/discovery/attack/post-attack);\
  \ SP 800-53 (controls baseline for programs/organizations); SP 800-53A (assessment procedures); SP 800-35 (procurement).\
