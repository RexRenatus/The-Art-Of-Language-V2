active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of immediate contract termination versus remediation opportunities
    for a vendor exhibiting minor security non-compliance (e.g., delayed patch deployment). Reference NIST SP 800-53 and ISO/IEC
    27001 controls, and consider impacts on organizational resilience in C-SCRM. Support arguments with real-world examples
    like the SolarWinds breach.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    approval'' vs. contractual right); 2) Partial truth (e.g., NIST control misapplied); 3) Irrelevant/exaggerated (e.g.,
    unrelated standard like GDPR). Ensure distractors promote analysis/evaluation.'

  Use the following to create 25 high-quality flashcards on ''Contract Termination for Security Non-Compliance'' (Topic Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Acquired Software Security Assessment > 003_Contract and Legal Requirements
  > Liability and Indemnification > Contract Termination for Security Non-Compliance).


  **Research Context:** Core concepts: Security Non-Compliance (failure to meet standards); Contract Termination (right to
  end for breach). Standards: NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (controls: Access Control AC, Audit/Accountability AU, Incident Response
  IR); ISO/IEC 27001 (ISMS standard; Annex A.15 Supplier Relationships: security in agreements, monitoring, termination rights).
  Big Picture: Essential in C-SCRM for resilience. Sources: NIST SP 800-53 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final);
  ISO/IEC 27001 (https://www.iso.org/standard/27001).


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the ''learning_objectives'' array here].

  - Scaffolding: [Insert the ''scaffolding'' object here]. Progress from Layer 1 to 4.

  - Active Learning Ties: [Insert the ''active_learning'' object here]. Reference in explanations.

  - Prior Knowledge/Related: Basic contract law, SDLC security, Liability/Indemnification, SLAs.


  **Output Format:** JSON array of objects, each: {''front'': ''Question'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''e.g., APPLY'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''e.g., 3'', ''related_objective'': ''#3'', ''active_tie'':
  ''e.g., Discussion prompt''}, ''type'': ''MCQ/Cloze/Open''}.


  **Flashcard Rules:** Follow [flashcard_schema]. Ensure measurable, active recall. Distractors per protocol. Cover all objectives/Bloom
  levels evenly. Make realistic with examples/clauses. No spoilers in fronts. High educational value.'
