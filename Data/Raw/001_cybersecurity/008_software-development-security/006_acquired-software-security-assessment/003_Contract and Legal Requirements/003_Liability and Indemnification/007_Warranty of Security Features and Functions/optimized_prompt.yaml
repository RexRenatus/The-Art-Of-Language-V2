  discussion_prompt: 'In groups, evaluate a scenario where a vendor''s software failed a security audit despite warranty claims
    (e.g., undetected vulnerability exploited like SolarWinds). Debate: Should the buyer pursue indemnification? What specific
    warranty language (e.g., referencing NIST SP 800-218) could prevent this? Consider C-SCRM implications.'
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student teaches SSDF practices (e.g., PR.1 security requirements) and C-SCRM integration with
    warranties; the partner quizzes with teach-back (e.g., 'How does a warranty differ from indemnity?'). Switch roles and
    reflect on misconceptions.
  problem_solving: Individually or in teams, draft a warranty clause for a hypothetical cloud software contract using NIST
    SP 800-218. Include specified threats (e.g., injection attacks), performance assurances, and links to indemnification.
    Peer review for completeness.

    vulnerabilities'' (overstates), ''Covers entire supply chain'' (too broad), ''Eliminates all liability'' (confuses with
    indemnity), ''Optional in all contracts'' (ignores SSDF best practices). Ensure plausible, tied to research.'

  Topic: ''Warranty of Security Features and Functions'' (Category: Cybersecurity > Domain: Software Development Security
  > Subdomain: Acquired Software Security Assessment > Entry Domain: 003_Contract and Legal Requirements > Entry Subdomain:
  Liability and Indemnification > Level 6 Topic).


  Research Context: Warranty assures vendor''s security mechanisms (e.g., protections vs. specified threats like injection
  attacks) perform as intended (NIST SP 800-218 SSDF). Ties to C-SCRM for supply chain risk mitigation (e.g., SolarWinds).
