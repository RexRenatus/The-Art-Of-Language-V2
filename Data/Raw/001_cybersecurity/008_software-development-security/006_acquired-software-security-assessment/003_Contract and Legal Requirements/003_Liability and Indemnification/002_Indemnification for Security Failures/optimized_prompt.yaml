active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between broad indemnification (unlimited liability) versus
    narrow indemnification (capped/excluded) for security failures in third-party software. Use NIST SP 800-161 to support
    arguments and consider impacts on vendor relationships and enterprise risk.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Prior Knowledge: Basic contract law, vulns, SCRM.

  - Big Picture: Reduces financial risks in acquired software assessment.

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert full 4 layers above, including NIST completions: SP 800-53 Rev. 5 SA-4(21) requires acquisition
  docs address supply chain protections; SP 800-161 Rev. 1 mandates SCRM in contracts. Sources: NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf),
  SP 800-161 Rev. 1 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-161r1.pdf), SolarWinds case (CISA alerts),
  SaaS examples (AWS Master Agreement)].

  - Active Learning: Weave in prompts for discussion/peer teaching/problems.

  - Real-world: SolarWinds supply chain attack as indemnification trigger.


  Generate flashcards per schema: [insert full schema above]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as {''type'': ''basic|mcq'',
  ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}}. Ensure Bloom''s progression, distractors are educationally sound, explanations scaffold
  learning. Cover voter priorities: pedagogy (objectives, scaffolding), completeness (NIST/sources/examples).'
