  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one partner explains a specific transfer mechanism (e.g., adequacy decisions, SCCs, BCRs, or APEC
    CBPR certification) including certification processes, then quizzes the partner on key steps and common misconceptions;
    switch roles.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A European software company is acquiring a US-based SaaS tool that processes EU customer personal
    data. Classify the data, assess adequacy status, select mechanisms (e.g., SCCs with supplementary measures), and outline
    a compliance plan including contract clauses and audits.'

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in university-level cybersecurity education. Generate 50\
  \ high-quality flashcards on 'Cross-Border Data Transfer Mechanisms' (Topic Hierarchy: Level 1: Cybersecurity → Level 2:\
  \ Software Development Security → Level 3: Acquired Software Security Assessment → Level 4: 003_Contract and Legal Requirements\
  \ → Level 5: Data Handling and Ownership → Level 6: Cross-Border Data Transfer Mechanisms). \n\nBIG PICTURE: This topic\
  \ ensures compliant data handling in acquired software assessments, mitigating vendor risks in global supply chains via\
  \ mechanisms like GDPR adequacy, SCCs, BCRs, APEC CBPR/PRP. Crucial for software security assurance.\n\nAlign flashcards\
  \ to these LEARNING OBJECTIVES (Bloom's Taxonomy): [insert the 6 objectives above]. Ensure even coverage: 20% Remember/Understand,\
  \ 30% Apply/Analyze, 50% Evaluate/Create.\n\nStructure content by SCAFFOLDING LAYERS: [insert the 4 layers with key_points\
  \ above]. Generate ~12-13 cards per layer.\n\nIncorporate: Prior knowledge (GDPR basics), common misconceptions (e.g., adequacy\
  \ permanent; cloud not transfer), APEC CBPR (certification process: self-assess, audit, list APEC economies), PRP (processors),\
  \ post-Schrems II (supplementary measures), UK GDPR differences (IDTAs).\n\nCONCEPT MAP: Central node links Regulations\
  \ → Mechanisms → Hierarchy.\n\nACTIVE LEARNING SUPPORT: Cards should prompt critical thinking for discussions (e.g., SCC\
  \ risks), scenarios for problem-solving.\n\nOutput EXACTLY 50 flashcards as a JSON array of objects following this SCHEMA:\
