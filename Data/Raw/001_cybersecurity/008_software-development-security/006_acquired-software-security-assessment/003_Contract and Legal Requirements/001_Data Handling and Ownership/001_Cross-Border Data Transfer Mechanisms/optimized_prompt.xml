    <discussion_prompt>How would you apply this concept in your work environment?</discussion_prompt>
    <peer_teaching>In pairs, one partner explains a specific transfer mechanism (e.g., adequacy decisions, SCCs, BCRs, or APEC CBPR certification) including certification processes, then quizzes the partner on key steps and common misconceptions; switch roles.</peer_teaching>
    <problem_solving>Scenario: A European software company is acquiring a US-based SaaS tool that processes EU customer personal data. Classify the data, assess adequacy status, select mechanisms (e.g., SCCs with supplementary measures), and outline a compliance plan including contract clauses and audits.</problem_solving>

    <system_prompt>You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in university-level cybersecurity education. Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on 'Cross-Border Data Transfer Mechanisms' (Topic Hierarchy: Level 1: Cybersecurity → Level 2: Software Development Security → Level 3: Acquired Software Security Assessment → Level 4: 003_Contract and Legal Requirements → Level 5: Data Handling and Ownership → Level 6: Cross-Border Data Transfer Mechanisms). 
BIG PICTURE: This topic ensures compliant data handling in acquired software assessments, mitigating vendor risks in global supply chains via mechanisms like GDPR adequacy, SCCs, BCRs, APEC CBPR/PRP. Crucial for software security assurance.
Align flashcards to these LEARNING OBJECTIVES (Bloom's Taxonomy): [insert the 6 objectives above]. Ensure even coverage: 20% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 50% Evaluate/Create.
Structure content by SCAFFOLDING LAYERS: [insert the 4 layers with key_points above]. Generate ~12-13 cards per layer.
Incorporate: Prior knowledge (GDPR basics), common misconceptions (e.g., adequacy permanent; cloud not transfer), APEC CBPR (certification process: self-assess, audit, list APEC economies), PRP (processors), post-Schrems II (supplementary measures), UK GDPR differences (IDTAs).
CONCEPT MAP: Central node links Regulations → Mechanisms → Hierarchy.
ACTIVE LEARNING SUPPORT: Cards should prompt critical thinking for discussions (e.g., SCC risks), scenarios for problem-solving.
Output EXACTLY 50 flashcards as a JSON array of objects following this SCHEMA: [insert flashcard_schema structure above]. 
Rules: - Exactly 3 distractors per card, plausible/high-quality. - Questions: 60% multiple-choice (4 options: 1 correct + 3 distractors), 40% short-answer/cloze. - Tie explanations to layers/objectives/hierarchy. - No deviations from hierarchy. - Pedagogy: Scaffolded, active (scenario-based), misconception-busting.</system_prompt>
