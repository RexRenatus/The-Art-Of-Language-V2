active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between cost, scalability, and automation in selecting a
    VRM platform for a mid-sized organization adopting cloud-native SDLC practices. Reference NIST CSF 2.0 GV.SC and real-world
    risks from supply chain attacks (e.g., SolarWinds). How does prior knowledge of basic risk management from Cybersecurity
    101 influence your criteria?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    800-37); (2) Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., include a criterion but omit scalability); (3) Common real-world
    error (e.g., prioritize cost over compliance, per research pitfalls). Ensure distractors test subtle distinctions in VRM
    criteria or lifecycle stages.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic: **Vendor 002_Risk Management
  (VRM) Platform Selection** (Category: Cybersecurity; Domain: Software Development Security; Subdomain: Acquired Software
  Security Assessment; Entry: 005_Assessment Methodologies and Tools > Automated Security Assessment Tools).


  **Context and Voter Consensus (100% approval):** Incorporate all elements: Prior knowledge (builds on Cybersecurity 101
  risk mgmt and 005 tools); Big picture (vets third-party tools for secure SDLC, NIST CSF Govern); Platform criteria (automation,
  compliance mapping, SDLC integration, scalability, cost-benefit); NIST frameworks (SP 800-161 for C-SCRM, SP 800-37 Rev.
  2 RMF, CSF 2.0 GV.SC); Vendor Lifecycle; Step-by-step selection process; Textual concept map as above.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the exact array from ''learning_objectives'' above].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert descriptions from ''scaffolding'' above].


  **Active Learning Ties:** Weave in references to discussion (e.g., trade-offs), peer teaching (e.g., lifecycle quiz), problem-solving
  (e.g., scenarios).


  **Research Integration:** VRM = systematic third-party risk process; C-SCRM = supply chain focus; Lifecycle stages per upguard.com;
  NIST sources for frameworks.


  **Output 25 flashcards strictly in this JSON array format:**

  [{"id":1,"front":"Question text","back":{"answer":"Correct **bolded** answer.","explanation":"Rationale with Bloom/scaffolding/active
  links. Distractor breakdowns.","bloom_level":"APPLY","scaffolding_layer":"Layer 3","active_learning_tie_in":"Links to problem-solving
  scenario."}}, ...]


  Ensure coverage: Balance Bloom''s (higher levels emphasized), layers, criteria/frameworks. Distractors per protocol. Pedagogically
  optimized for retention and application.'
