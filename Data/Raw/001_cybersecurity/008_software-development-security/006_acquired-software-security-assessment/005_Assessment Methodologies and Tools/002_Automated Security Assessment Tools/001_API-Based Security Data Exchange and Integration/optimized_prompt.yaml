active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of API-based security data exchange versus traditional
    protocols (e.g., SNMP or syslog): How does API integration enhance real-time threat sharing in dynamic cloud-native environments,
    and what are the heightened risks? Link to NIST CSF 2.0 functions and provide evidence from NIST SP 800-228.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
