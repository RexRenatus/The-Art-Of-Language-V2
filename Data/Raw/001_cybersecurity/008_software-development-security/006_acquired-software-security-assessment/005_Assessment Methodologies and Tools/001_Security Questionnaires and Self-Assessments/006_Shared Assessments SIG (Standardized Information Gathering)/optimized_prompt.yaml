active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue the pros and cons of using the SIG questionnaire versus developing custom vendor
    assessments. Consider factors like standardization, cost, depth of coverage, and adaptability to industry-specific risks
    (e.g., privacy in healthcare). Reference risk domains and TPRM integration to support claims.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    broad TPRM); (2) Partial Truths (e.g., list similar domain like ''Network Security'' for ''Access Control''); (3) Voter-Prioritized
    Errors (e.g., confuse with CAIQ, omit Nth-party); (4) Hierarchical Mix-ups (e.g., domain from wrong level like Software
    Dev Security). Ensure plausible, high-quality to promote active error correction.'
