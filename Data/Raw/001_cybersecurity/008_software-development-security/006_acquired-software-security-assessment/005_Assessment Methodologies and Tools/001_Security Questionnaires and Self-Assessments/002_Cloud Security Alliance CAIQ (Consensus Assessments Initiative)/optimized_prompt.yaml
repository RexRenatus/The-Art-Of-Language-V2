active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of relying on self-assessments like CAIQ versus third-party
    audits in the CSA STAR Program. Consider scenarios where partial responses might indicate hidden risks, and propose criteria
    for when to escalate to full audits. Support your arguments with references to cloud service models (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Partial truth (e.g., Yes instead of Partial); 3) Unrelated/exaggerated (e.g., mix with non-CSA frameworks like NIST directly).
    Ensure distractors test analysis/evaluation skills.'

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards optimized for university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (cover all 6 levels via provided
  objectives), active learning (link to activities), 4-layer scaffolding (prereqs + layers 1-4), and voter consensus (100%
  approval on pedagogy, completeness).


  Incorporate research: CAIQ by CSA for cloud provider assessments (transparency, risk mgmt via Yes/No/Partial responses aligned
  to CCM/STAR). Use provided scaffolding content, samples, concept map, sources.


  Output ONLY in JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"front": "...", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "mcq_options":
  ["A", "B", "C", "D"], "related_objectives": ["Remember", "Apply"], "active_learning_link": "Discussion on trade-offs"}}.


  Follow flashcard schema exactly: distractors plausible; explanations tie to objectives/layers; ensure scaffolding progression
  (5-7 cards per layer).
