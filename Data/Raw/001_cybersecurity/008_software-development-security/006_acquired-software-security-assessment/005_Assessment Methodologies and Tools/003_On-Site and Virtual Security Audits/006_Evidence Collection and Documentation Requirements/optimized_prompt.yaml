active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In small groups, debate the trade-offs of comprehensive evidence logging (e.g., NIST AU-2 auditable events)
    versus performance impacts in production DevSecOps pipelines, using real-world examples like the SolarWinds breach.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (2) Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''logs only'' vs. full evidence types), (3) Similar but wrong standard (e.g.,
    ISO 27002 vs. 27001). Ensure distractors are realistic for cybersecurity professionals.'

  **Content Summary (Completed per voter consensus):** Evidence in cybersecurity audits includes logs, configs, tests proving
  security facts. Collection: Gather from SDLC/ops. Documentation: Metadata-rich records. Standards: NIST 800-53r5 AU (AU-1
  policy, AU-2 events/content/review, AU-3, AU-6 reports); NIST CSF (DE.CM-1 monitoring, RS.CO-2); ISO 27001 A.12.4 logging,
  A.16.1 incidents; CIS v8 Safeguard 6.3/7.5 logs. Procedures: Identify events → Collect (SIEM, ELK) → Document chain-of-custody
  → Integrate DevSecOps. Real examples: SolarWinds (evidence gaps). Sources: NIST SP 800-53r5, NIST CSF 2.0, ISO/IEC 27001:2022,
  CIS Controls v8, OWASP Testing Guide v4.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives from above].

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers from above].

  **Active Learning Ties:** Weave in prompts (e.g., ''Apply to discussion: ...'').

  **Concept Map:** Central node ''Evidence Collection & Doc'' links to NIST AU, ISO logging, SDLC, audits.

  **Prior Knowledge:** Builds on on-site/virtual audit basics.


  **Generation Instructions:**

  - Distribute: 6 Remember/Understand (Layer 1-2), 10 Apply/Analyze (Layer 2-3), 9 Evaluate/Create (Layer 3-4).

  - Use exact flashcard schema: Front (Q + 4 options), Back (correct + 3 distractors w/ rationale + detailed explanation +
  metadata).

  - Ensure completeness: Cover all standards, voters'' priorities (NIST CSF full, ISO/CIS added, sources populated).

  - Distractors: Strictly follow protocol.

  - Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}, ''metadata'': {...}}, ...].

  - High-quality: Active voice, precise, educational depth for CISSP-level learners.'
