active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student teaches the other about Key Risk Indicators (KRIs), Standardized Information Gathering
    (SIG) questionnaires, and maturity models for TPRM evaluation; switch roles and provide feedback on accuracy and clarity.
  problem_solving: Analyze a mock vendor dossier (e.g., includes ISO 27001 certification but Log4j exposure history). Teams
    assess risk posture using NIST guidelines, recommend mitigations, and present findings in a 5-minute pitch.

    - Partial truth (e.g., NIST CSF function misapplied)
    - Extreme/opposite (e.g., 'Ignore third-party risks if certified')

  Generate 25 high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards optimized for university-level learning. Integrate:

  - Learning objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active learning: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE] (reference in explanations)

  - Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL LAYERS FROM ABOVE] (tag each card to 1 layer)

  - Research context: TPRM definitions, NIST CSF 2.0, SP 800-161, ISO 27001/27036, SIG questionnaires, KRIs, maturity models,
  cases (SolarWinds, Log4j).

  - Best practices: Step-by-step evaluation, vendor assessments.


  Follow flashcard schema exactly: [INSERT FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Output as JSON array of objects, e.g., [{''front'': ''...'',
  ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''references'': ''...'', ''related_activity'': ''...''}, ''metadata'':
  {...}}].

  Ensure Bloom''s progression, distractor quality, and scaffolding flow. Cards must foster active learning (e.g., ''How would
  you apply this in a peer teach?''). No duplicates; cover all objectives.'
