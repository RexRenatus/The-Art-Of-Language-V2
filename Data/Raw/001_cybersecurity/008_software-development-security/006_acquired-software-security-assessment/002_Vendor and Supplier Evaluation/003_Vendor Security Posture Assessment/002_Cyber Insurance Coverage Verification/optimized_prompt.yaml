  discussion_prompt: 'Debate: To what extent should cyber insurance coverage verification influence vendor selection in software
    acquisition? Provide pros and cons using examples from NIST CSF (e.g., Identify and Protect functions) or ISO 27001 (e.g.,
    A.18.2.3 for electronic messaging). Address misconceptions like assuming all cyber incidents (e.g., ransomware vs. insider
    threats) are automatically covered.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., ''All breaches are covered'' vs. reality with exclusions).

    - Distractor 2: Confuse similar terms (e.g., ''cyber event'' vs. ''cyber incident'').

    - Distractor 3: Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Only ransomware'' vs. broader incidents).

    Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter-noted misconceptions and research (e.g., assuming compliance equals coverage).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 25 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Cyber Insurance Coverage
  Verification'' (Category: Cybersecurity; Domain: Software Development Security; Subdomain: Acquired Software Security Assessment;
  Entry: 002_Vendor and Supplier Evaluation; Entry Subdomain: Vendor Security Posture Assessment). Hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > Software Development Security > Acquired Software Security Assessment > 002_Vendor and Supplier Evaluation > Vendor Security
  Posture Assessment > Cyber Insurance Coverage Verification.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM JSON].

  - Active learning: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM JSON] – tag relevant cards.

  - Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL 4 LAYERS FROM JSON] – distribute cards across layers (6-7 per layer).

  - Research context: Core concepts (Cyber Insurance, Compliance, Risk Assessment, Resilience, Event, Incident); Standards:
  NIST CSF, ISO 27001, Regulations (GDPR, CCPA); Best practices: Policy review, exclusions check; Voter priorities: Completeness
  (full standards, sources), pedagogy (progressive Bloom''s), misconceptions (e.g., coverage assumptions).

  - Prior knowledge: Builds on vendor questionnaires for financial assurance.

  - Concept map: Central ''Cyber Insurance Verification'' → Vendor Posture, NIST/ISO, Risk Assessment, Business Continuity.


  Use EXACT flashcard schema: [INSERT FULL SCHEMA FROM JSON]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcards, e.g., [{''id'': ''...'',
  ...}, ...]. Ensure coverage: 4-5 cards per Bloom''s level, balanced layers, MCQs with strong distractors, explanations grounded
  in standards/sources. Vary formats (definition, scenario, comparison). No duplicates; optimize for Anki/Spaced Repetition.'
