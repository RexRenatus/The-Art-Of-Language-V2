  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of pursuing StateRAMP Moderate vs. High authorization for
    a CSP serving state governments: How do compliance costs, market access, and data sensitivity (e.g., PII/PHI) influence
    the decision? Reference alignments with NIST SP 800-53 and real-world state procurement examples.'

    CIS Controls'' vs. NIST 800-53), 2) Overgeneralization (e.g., ''Applies only to IaaS, not SaaS''), 3) Partial truth (e.g.,
    ''Moderate level matches FedRAMP High''). Ensure one distractor is a frequent confusion like FedRAMP equivalence. Mark
    correct answer clearly.'

  Incorporate this research context: StateRAMP (rebranded GovRAMP) standardizes cloud security for state/local gov, built
  on NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 controls, uses NIST SP 800-60 Rev. 1 for categorizing systems (Low/Mod/High impact based on confidentiality/integrity/availability
  for data like PII/PHI). ''Verify once, serve many'' via 3PAO assessments, ATOs, continuous monitoring. Other regionals:
  CA CASF (risk-based assessments), TX DIR cloud security (multi-tenant controls), multi-state pacts. Sources: StateRAMP.org,
  NIST SP 800-53/800-60 Rev. 1, FedRAMP.gov comparisons.


  Use these learning objectives [insert array above], active learning activities [reference for scenarios], and 4-layer scaffolding
  [insert scaffolding above] to ensure coverage across Bloom''s Taxonomy (balanced: 30% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze,
  40% Evaluate/Create).


  Generate flashcards following this schema [insert flashcard_schema above]. Categorize by Layer (Layer1_Foundation, etc.)
  and Bloom''s level. Include voter priorities: completeness (NIST 800-60 full, other regionals like CA/TX), pedagogy (MCQs
  with distractors on FedRAMP confusion), engagement (scenarios), scaffolding (4 layers), knowledge integration (FedRAMP prereq).


  Output ONLY a markdown table or CSV block of 25-35 flashcards, e.g.,

  | Tags | Front | Back | Distractors |

  |------|-------|------|-------------|

  Ensure variety: 40% Basic Q/A, 40% MCQ (4 options), 20% Cloze. High-quality, active recall-focused.'
