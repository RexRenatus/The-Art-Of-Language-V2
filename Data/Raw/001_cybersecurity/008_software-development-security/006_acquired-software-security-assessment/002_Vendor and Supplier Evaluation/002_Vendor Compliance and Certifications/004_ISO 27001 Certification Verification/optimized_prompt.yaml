active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the limitations of relying solely on ISO 27001 certification for vendor
    selection in software development. Consider scenarios where certification exists but software-specific risks (e.g., insecure
    dependencies) persist. Support arguments with Annex A controls and propose hybrid evaluation strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1 common misconception (e.g., ''ISO 27001 certifies software
    code directly''), 1 edge case (e.g., ''Surveillance audits every 5 years''), 1 unrelated concept (e.g., confuses with
    ISO 27002). Base on research context, voter priorities, and typical errors in vendor verification (e.g., ignoring scope).
    Ensure distractors promote critical thinking.'
