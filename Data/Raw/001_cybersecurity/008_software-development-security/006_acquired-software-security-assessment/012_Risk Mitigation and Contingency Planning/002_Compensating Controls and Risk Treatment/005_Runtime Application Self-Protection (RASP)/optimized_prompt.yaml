  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the scenario: ''A company has acquired third-party software with unknown
    vulnerabilities. How does RASP serve as a compensating control compared to a WAF, and what are the trade-offs in performance
    and false positives?'' Encourage critical thinking by requiring evidence from behavioral analysis vs. signature-based
    detection.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Incorporate these exactly:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste the full learning_objectives array here].

  - Scaffolding: [Paste the full scaffolding array here]. Cover all 4 layers progressively.

  - Active Learning: Weave in elements (e.g., scenario prompts from exercises).

  - Prior Knowledge: SDLC vulnerabilities, attacks (SQLi/XSS), compensating controls.

  - Key Content: RASP definition, core concepts (real-time, in-app, behavioral), how it works (instrumentation, blocking),
  zero-day mitigation, RASP vs WAF (as in Layer 3), sources (OWASP RASP Cheat Sheet, Imperva).

  - Knowledge Checks: Include MCQs on misconceptions (RASP=WAF? Signatures?).


  **Output Format (Strict JSON Array of Objects):** Each flashcard as {"front": "Question", "back": "Answer | Explanation
  (link to objective/layer/source) | Bloom Level | Scaffolding Layer | Distractors (if MCQ)"}. Use flashcard_schema exactly:
  40% MCQ w/ 3 distractors (misconceptions: WAF confusion, signatures, no context), balanced types/distribution. Ensure active
  recall, no hints on front. Make explanations educational for self-testing.'
