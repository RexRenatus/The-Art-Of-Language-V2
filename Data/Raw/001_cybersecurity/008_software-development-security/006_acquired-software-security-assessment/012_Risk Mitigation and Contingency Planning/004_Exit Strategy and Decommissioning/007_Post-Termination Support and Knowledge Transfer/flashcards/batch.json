        "core_logic": "An SBOM provides a comprehensive inventory of software components, which is vital for post-termination knowledge transfer because it allows the acquiring organization to identify all dependencies and their associated security risks. This visibility is essential for managing vulnerabilities when vendor support is no longer available.",
        "distractor_analysis": "License compliance is a use case, but not the primary security purpose. SBOMs do not automate updates. They complement, rather than replace, detailed security documentation.",
        "analogy": "An SBOM is like an ingredient list for a complex dish; it tells you exactly what's in it, which is crucial for understanding potential allergens or substitutions when the original chef is gone."
