active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains core Vendor BCP components (e.g., risk assessment, recovery plans, cybersecurity
    integration) while the other quizzes them on connections to organizational BCP and prior Risk Mitigation knowledge; switch
    roles and reflect on misconceptions.
  problem_solving: Groups receive a mock vendor BCP document from a software supplier; identify gaps (e.g., weak cyber recovery
    testing), propose fixes in a simulated acquisition scenario, and role-play presenting recommendations to a 'CISO'—include
    formative self-assessment on Bloom's levels achieved.

    2) Partial truth (e.g., valid for general BCP but not vendor-specific), 3) Extreme/opposite (e.g., ignore cybersecurity
    link). Base on research context (e.g., vendor risks like supply chain hacks) and voter priorities. Ensure distractors
    test nuance (e.g., cyber resilience vs. mere recovery).'

  > Level3 Acquired Software Security Assessment > Level4 012_Risk Mitigation and Contingency Planning > Level5 016_Business
  Continuity and Disaster Recovery > Level6 Vendor Business Continuity Plan (BCP) Review).


  Incorporate research context: BCP ensures operations during disruptions (cyberattacks, ransomware); Vendor BCP Review assesses
  third-party resilience to protect org cybersecurity. Key: Cyber Resilience (anticipate/withstand/recover/adapt). Vendor
  risks: Supply chain compromises (e.g., SolarWinds). Sources: securityscorecard.com, bryghtpath.com.

  ACTIVE LEARNING INTEGRATION: Cards should prompt reflection on discussion (SolarWinds), peer teaching (components), problem-solving
  (mock BCP gaps).
