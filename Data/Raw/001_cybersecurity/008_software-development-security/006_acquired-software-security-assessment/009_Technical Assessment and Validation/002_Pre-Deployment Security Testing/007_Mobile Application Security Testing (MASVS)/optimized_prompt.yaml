active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of implementing MASVS-L1 (standard) versus MASVS-L2 (defense-in-depth)
    policies for a banking app. Consider development time, user experience, and threat models. Support arguments with specific
    controls like MASVS-STORAGE-001 (secure data storage).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1 common misconception (e.g., confuse MASVS with MASTG),
    1 related but incorrect term (e.g., MASVS-STORAGE vs. MASVS-PLATFORM), 1 edge case or outdated concept (e.g., pre-MASVS
    v2 groups). Ensure distractors are realistic based on research context.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in OWASP MASVS for Mobile
  Application Security Testing (MASVS) in the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity (L1) > Software Development Security (L2) > Acquired
  Software Security Assessment (L3) > 009_Technical Assessment and Validation (L4) > Pre-Deployment Security Testing (L5)
  > Mobile 008_006_Application Security Testing (MASVS) (L6).


  Use this research context: MASVS is OWASP''s standard for mobile app security verification across lifecycle/procurement.
  Includes MASTG (testing guide), MASWE (weaknesses). Control groups: e.g., MASVS-STORAGE (MASVS-STORAGE-001: encrypt data-at-rest),
  MASVS-NETWORK (secure data-in-transit), ARCHITECTURE, PLATFORM, CODE-QUALITY, etc. Policies: L1 (standard), L2 (advanced).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Scaffolding layers: [insert full 4 layers above]. Ensure cards progress from Layer 1 foundations to Layer 4 integrations.

  - Active learning: Tie explanations to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving (e.g., ''Discuss: Trade-offs for this control?'').


  Generate flashcards per schema: [insert full schema above]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 40-60 flashcards, no additional
  text. Ensure completeness (all control groups/examples), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression), voter priorities (e.g., control
  details, interconnections).'
