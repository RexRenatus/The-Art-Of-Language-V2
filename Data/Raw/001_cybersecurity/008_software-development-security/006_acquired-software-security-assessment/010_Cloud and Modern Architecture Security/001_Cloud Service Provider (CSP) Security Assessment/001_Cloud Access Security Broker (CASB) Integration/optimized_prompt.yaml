active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of proxy-based versus API-based CASB deployment models
    for an organization shifting to hybrid cloud environments. Consider factors like performance impact, visibility granularity,
    and scalability. Support your arguments with real-world examples from sources like Gartner reports.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Related but incorrect term (e.g., SASE instead of DLP); 3) Partial truth (e.g., ''Only for sanctioned IT'' for visibility).
    Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter-completed content and research.'

  \ (CASB) Integration). Prior knowledge: Learners know basic CSP risks and IAM from CSP Security Assessment.\n\nContent Summary\
  \ (complete and comprehensive):\nCASB: Intermediary enforcing security policies between users and cloud providers. Manages\
  \ Shadow IT (unsanctioned apps), Sanctioned IT (approved, e.g., AWS, Salesforce). Key features: DLP (protect PII/financial\
  \ data), integration with SASE.\nFour Pillars: 1. Visibility (discover/monitor apps); 2. Compliance (regulatory adherence);\
  \ 3. Threat Protection (malware detection); 4. Data Security (DLP/encryption).\nDeployment Models: Proxy-based (Inline:\
  \ Forward Proxy for outbound user traffic; Reverse Proxy for inbound; Out-of-band); API-based (polls CSP APIs for logs/controls);\
  \ Agent-based (endpoint software); Hybrid (combines models).\nIntegration Steps: Assess risks, select model, configure policies,\
  \ integrate IAM, test/monitor.\nSources: Gartner Magic Quadrant for CASB (2023), NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (Cloud Controls),\
  \ Zscaler/Netskope docs.\n\nIncorporate Pedagogy:\n- Learning Objectives: [insert array above]. Distribute flashcards across\
