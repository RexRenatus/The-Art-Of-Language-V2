  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives JSON ARRAY HERE]

  - Active learning for reinforcement: [INSERT active_learning JSON OBJECT HERE]

  - Scaffolding layers: [INSERT scaffolding_layers JSON ARRAY HERE]

  - Prior knowledge: Link to CSPs, Docker, Kubernetes, misconfigurations.

  - Voter consensus: 82.9% approval; complete components (CSPM, CWPP, CIEM, IaC Scanning, Security Guardrails: automated policy
  enforcement; DSPM if relevant); concept map interconnections.

  - Research: CNAPP unifies lifecycle security for cloud-native apps (containers/microservices/serverless); agentless/agent-based;
  holistic visibility.


  Generate flashcards per schema: [INSERT flashcard_schema JSON OBJECT HERE]. Output as JSON array of objects, each with ''type'',
  ''question/prompt'', ''answer'', ''options'' (if MCQ), ''explanation'', ''bloom_level'', ''scaffolding_layer'', ''tags''
  (e.g., ''CSPM'', ''agentless''). Ensure active recall, plausible distractors, and educational depth for university-level
  learners.'
