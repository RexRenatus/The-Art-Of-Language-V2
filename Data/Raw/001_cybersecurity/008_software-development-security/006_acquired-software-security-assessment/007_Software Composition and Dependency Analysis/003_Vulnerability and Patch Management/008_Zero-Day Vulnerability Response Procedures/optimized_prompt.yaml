active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between rapid vendor notification and internal containment
    in a zero-day scenario exploiting a third-party dependency. Reference NIST SP 800-61 and CISA guidance to support arguments,
    and evaluate how this impacts software composition analysis.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., confuse zero-day
    with known vuln), 2) Related but incorrect terms (e.g., ''patch deployment'' instead of ''workaround''), 3) Partial truths
    (e.g., out-of-order NIST phases), 4) Voter-prioritized clarity issues (avoid dramatic phrases; use standard terms). Ensure
    distractors test analysis/evaluation.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Zero-Day Vulnerability
  Response Procedures (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Acquired Software Security Assessment
  > 007_Software Composition and Dependency Analysis > 005_Vulnerability and Patch Management > Zero-Day Vulnerability Response
  Procedures). Generate 25-35 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet, covering all Bloom''s levels and 4 scaffolding
  layers. Use precise, standard terminology (no dramatic phrases). Incorporate voter consensus: clarity, pedagogy (objectives/scaffolding),
  completeness (NIST SP 800-61r2 phases, CISA steps), knowledge integration (links to patch management/SCA/SBOM).
