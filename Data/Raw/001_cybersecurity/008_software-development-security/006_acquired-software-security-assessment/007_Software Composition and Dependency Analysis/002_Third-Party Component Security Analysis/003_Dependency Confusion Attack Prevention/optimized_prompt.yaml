  **Full Research Context (Complete Synthesis):**

  Dependency confusion attacks exploit package managers fetching malicious public packages named like private internals. Core
  concepts: Software supply chain; Dependency confusion (name squatting); Package managers (npm, pip, RubyGems); Public registries
  (npmjs.com, PyPI); Private registries (Artifactory, Nexus).

  Attack Vectors: Attacker publishes malicious pkg to public registry matching private name; package mgr resolves public first/fallback
  (e.g., npm checks npmjs before private if not scoped). Risks: Malicious code exec in builds/dev, supply chain compromise.

  Real-world: Alex Birsan (2021) hit Shopify/Uber ($100k+ bounties); AWS (capital-one-like?); Microsoft (ua-parser-js hijack).

  Prevention Best Practices: 1) Scoped packages (@org/pkg); 2) Private registry priority (.npmrc: registry=https://private;
  scope=@org); 3) Lockfiles (package-lock.json, Pipfile.lock); 4) Auth/verify (tokens, domain scoping); 5) Logs/audit (npm
  ls --parseable); 6) SCA tools (Dependabot alerts, npm audit, Snyk, Sigstore signing). Standards: OWASP Software Supply Chain
  Security, SLSA Framework Levels 2-4.

  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s):** [Insert the 6 objectives from above].

  **Active Learning Activities:** [Insert the 3 activities from above] – Tie advanced flashcards to these.

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers from above] – Distribute flashcards evenly.


  **Generation Instructions:** Follow flashcard_schema exactly. Ensure completeness (cover voters'' priorities: attack vectors,
  prevention, examples). Use active voice, precise terms. Vary difficulty within layers (Layer 1: basic; Layer 4: evaluative).
  Promote retention: concise fronts (<20 words), explanatory backs.

  **Output Format:** JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''layer'':
  1, ''bloom_level'': ''Remember'', ''tags'': [''definition'', ''registries''], ''type'': ''mcq'' or ''qa'' etc.}]. Group
  by layer in array sections if >50 cards. No extra text.'
