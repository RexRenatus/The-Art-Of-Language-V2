active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios would you prioritize IAST over SAST or DAST in a DevSecOps pipeline, and why? Debate
    the trade-offs in terms of accuracy, speed, and cost, considering factors like application complexity and team expertise.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    sensors with DAST scanners; mix up false positives with SAST; reference real tools incorrectly like ''uses black-box only'').
