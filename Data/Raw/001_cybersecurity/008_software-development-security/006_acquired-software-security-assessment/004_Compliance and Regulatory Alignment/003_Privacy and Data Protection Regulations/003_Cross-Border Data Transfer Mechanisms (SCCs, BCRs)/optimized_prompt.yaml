  discussion_prompt: 'Post-Schrems II, SCCs require data exporters to conduct Transfer Impact Assessments (TIAs). Debate:
    Are BCRs inherently more robust than updated SCCs for multinational corporations handling sensitive personal data? Consider
    approval rigor, ongoing obligations, and enforcement challenges. Support your position with references to EU Commission
    guidelines.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
