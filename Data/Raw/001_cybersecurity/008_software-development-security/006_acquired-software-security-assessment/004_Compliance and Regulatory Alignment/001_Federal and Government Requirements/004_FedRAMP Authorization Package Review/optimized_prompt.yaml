active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs of defining a narrow versus broad Authorization Boundary for a CSO in hypothetical
    federal agency scenarios (e.g., DoD vs. HHS). Debate pros/cons for security, cost, and scalability, referencing FedRAMP
    baselines and NIST SP 800-53 controls.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (20% of cards): 3-4 options. Distractors are plausible (e.g., confuse SSP/SAP appendices,
    swap Moderate/High baselines, mix RMF/FedRAMP terms). One correct, others common misconceptions from FedRAMP FAQs. Explain
    why distractors are wrong.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert FedRAMP flashcard generator synthesizing university-level pedagogy for ''FedRAMP Authorization
  Package Review'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Acquired Software Security Assessment

  **Context and Research (authoritative, web-grounded):** FedRAMP ensures CSPs meet federal security for CSOs. Core: Authorization
  Package (SSP: security blueprint w/ A-Q appendices defining boundary/controls; SAP: assessment plan A-D; SAR: findings A-F;
  POA&M: remediation Appendix O; ATO Letter). Standards: FISMA, NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (baselines: Low/Mod/High), RMF, PMO
  guidelines, OSCAL. Big picture: Enables Cloud Smart, Zero Trust, secure acquisition. Prior knowledge: NIST controls, shared
  responsibility.
