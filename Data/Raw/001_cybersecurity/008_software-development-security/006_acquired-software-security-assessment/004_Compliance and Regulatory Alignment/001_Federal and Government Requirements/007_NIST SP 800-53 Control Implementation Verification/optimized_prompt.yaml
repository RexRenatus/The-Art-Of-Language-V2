active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given a recent supply chain attack like SolarWinds, debate which NIST SP 800-53 control families (e.g.,
    Supply Chain Risk Management (SR), System and Information Integrity (SI)) are most critical to verify in acquired software.
    Propose prioritization strategies based on risk impact, federal requirements (FISMA/FedRAMP), and resource constraints.
    Support arguments with evidence from NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    1. Common misconceptions (e.g., confuse verification with selection).

    2. Related but incorrect concepts (e.g., SSP as implementation vs. description).

    3. Partial truths (e.g., wrong control family).

    4. Edge cases from research/voter suggestions (e.g., FedRAMP Low vs. Moderate).

    Ensure 40% Remember, 30% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate/Create.'

  **Core Content:** Use the provided scaffolding layers, learning objectives, active learning activities, and research context
  (NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5: 20 families like AC/AU/CM/SI/SR; SSP; FedRAMP for cloud; verification via assess-test-document;
  examples like AU-2 logging, SolarWinds risks). Voter consensus: 100% approval, emphasize completeness (full FedRAMP: standardized
  cloud auth using 800-53), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression), problem-solving (mock SSP gaps), scaffolding.


  **Pedagogical Guidelines:**

  - Align to Bloom''s: Remember/Understand (defs), Apply (techniques), Analyze (gaps), Evaluate (prioritize), Create (plans).

  - Scaffolding: Generate flashcards progressively (Layer 1: 10 cards, Layer 2: 12, etc.).

  - Active Learning Integration: Each card ties to discussion/peer teach/problem-solving.

  - Prerequisites: Assume basic SDLC/FISMA/NIST awareness.


  **Output 50 flashcards strictly in the schema:**

  **Front:** [Question]

  **Back:**

  - **Correct:** [Answer]

  - **Explanation:** [Detailed, with Bloom''s tie-in, context, sources]

  - **Distractors:** A: [wrong] (reason); B: [wrong]; C: [wrong]

  - **Active Tie-in:** [e.g., ''Apply to mock SSP exercise'']


  Ensure high-quality: University-level, distractors plausible, explanations scaffolded, comprehensive coverage.'
