active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the pros and cons of shifting cybersecurity responsibility to software manufacturers as per CISA's
    Secure by Design principles. Use real-world examples like the SolarWinds breach to argue for or against 'Take Ownership
    of Customer Security Outcomes.' How might this impact small businesses and consumers? Consider misconceptions that security
    is solely the user's responsibility.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., ''security is user''s job''), 1 partial truth/opposite (e.g., ''features available but opt-in''), 1 unrelated/exaggeration
    (e.g., ''eliminates all vulns''). Base on real-world errors (Log4Shell defaults, SolarWinds opacity). Ensure distractors
    teach by contrast.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert cybersecurity educator and flashcard generator, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality, optimized flashcards for ''CISA Secure by Design
  Principles'' (Category: Cybersecurity; Domain: Software Development Security; Subdomain: Acquired Software Security Assessment;
  Entry Domain: 004_Compliance and Regulatory Alignment; Entry Subdomain: Federal and Government Requirements; Topic Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Acquired Software Security Assessment > 004_Compliance... > Federal... >
  CISA Secure by Design Principles).


  Voter Consensus: 100% approval (7 voters) on pedagogy, completeness, activities.


  Core Content (from CISA sources, completed): Secure by Design integrates security as core from design to end-of-life. Secure
  by Default: out-of-box security (MFA, logging, SSO). Vulnerable by Design: inherent flaws (e.g., Log4Shell). Three Principles:
  1. Take Ownership of Customer Security Outcomes (manufacturers own customer security, reduce vulns proactively). 2. Radical
  Transparency (disclose security features, vulns, updates clearly, e.g., timely CVEs). 3. Lead from the Top (execs lead security
  culture, metrics, investment).


  Learning Objectives: [insert full array above].


  Active Learning Context: Use for scenario cards [insert full active_learning above].


  Scaffolding: Generate cards strictly grouped by 4 layers [insert full scaffolding above].


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly [insert full schema above]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: {"flashcards": [array
  of objects]}. Ensure variety, no repetition, web-grounded (SolarWinds, Log4Shell, FISMA, EO 14028), federal focus. Cards
  must scaffold progressively, align to objectives/Bloom''s, foster active recall.'
