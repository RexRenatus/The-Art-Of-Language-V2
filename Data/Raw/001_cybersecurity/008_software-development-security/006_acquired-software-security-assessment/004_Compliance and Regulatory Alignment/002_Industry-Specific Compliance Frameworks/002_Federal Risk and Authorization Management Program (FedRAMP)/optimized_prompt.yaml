active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between Agency-sponsored and JAB authorization paths under
    FedRAMP. Consider factors like time, cost, reusability, and security rigor. Use real-world examples such as Microsoft
    Azure Government (JAB-authorized) vs. a smaller Agency path. How does this impact acquired software security assessment
    in federal contexts?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - Plausible errors from prior knowledge (e.g., confuse Moderate/High baselines with commercial clouds).
  - Common misconceptions (e.g., 'FedRAMP only for DoD' vs. government-wide).
  - Edge cases (e.g., Low baseline as distractor for CUI).
  - Real-world mix-ups (e.g., AWS commercial as authorized).

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/SuperMemo using university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (use provided
  objectives), active learning (inspire discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving), 4-layer scaffolding (reference layers explicitly),
  and voter consensus (completeness, real-world examples like AWS GovCloud).


  Incorporate:

  - Big Picture: FedRAMP standardizes secure federal cloud adoption for acquired software.

  - Prior Knowledge: NIST SP 800-53, FISMA.

  - Full Content: Definitions, SA&A steps, baselines (Moderate/High), paths (Agency/JAB), continuous monitoring, integrations
  (OSCAL, CMMC, Marketplace), FedRAMP Authorization Act (FISMA 2014 standardization).


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly:

  - 40% Layer 1/2 (Remember/Understand: MCQ/cloze).

  - 30% Layer 3 (Apply/Analyze: scenario-based).

  - 30% Layer 4 (Evaluate/Create: critique/design).

  - Structure: Front (question), Back (answer + 3 distractors if MCQ + explanation with Bloom tie-in, layer ref, example,
  source).

  - Distractors: Plausible per protocol.


  Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''A'', ''B'', ''C''], ''explanation'':
