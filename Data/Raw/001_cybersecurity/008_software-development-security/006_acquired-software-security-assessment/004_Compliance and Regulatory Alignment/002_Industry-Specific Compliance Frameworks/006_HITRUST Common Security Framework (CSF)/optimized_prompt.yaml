active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the advantages of HITRUST CSF's 'One Framework, One Assessment' approach versus managing multiple
    separate compliance frameworks like ISO 27001 and HIPAA individually. Consider cost, efficiency, and risk coverage in
    a healthcare software vendor scenario.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains the 'Ecosystem' concept and how it integrates third-party risks, while the
    partner teaches back the role of 'Authoritative Sources' with examples from over 60 standards (e.g., ISO 27001, HIPAA,
    NIST). Switch roles and discuss real-world applications in software acquisition.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A company is acquiring third-party software for handling patient data. In groups, identify applicable
    HITRUST control categories, map associated risks (e.g., data breaches), and propose a mitigation plan using the risk-based
    approach, including steps for HITRUST Assurance Program certification.'
  additional_activities:
  - 'Think-Pair-Share: Discuss common misconceptions (e.g., ''HITRUST is only for healthcare'') and counter with examples
    from finance or other sectors.'
  - 'Role-Playing: Simulate a HITRUST assessment interview between an assessor and a software vendor.'
  - 'Group Project: Design a compliance checklist for the MyCSF platform, incorporating case studies like the Change Healthcare
    breach.'
