active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the implications of over-privileging service accounts in a production Kubernetes
    cluster. How does RBAC enforce Zero Trust Architecture, and what real-world breaches (e.g., via misconfigured bindings)
    could be prevented? Reference CIS Kubernetes Benchmarks and NIST CSF PR.AC-4.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Learning Objectives: [REMEMBER: List/define components... CREATE: Design custom policy... full list as above].


  Scaffolding: [Layer1 Foundation... Layer4 Integration... full as above].


  Active Learning Integration: Questions should prompt recall/application usable in discussions/labs (e.g., minikube tests).


  Research Context: RBAC via rbac.authorization.k8s.io; Core: Subjects, Roles (namespace), ClusterRoles (cluster/any ns),
  Bindings, Rules (verbs: get/list/create/etc., apiGroups: apps/, resources: pods); PoLP; Standards: CIS Benchmarks 5.1.*,
  NIST CSF PR.AC-4, ISO 27001 A.9.2, NIST SP 800-53 AC-6.


  Generate exactly 24 flashcards (4 per Bloom''s level: 1 Foundation, 1 Components, 1 Implementation, 1 Integration). Questions
  active/unambiguous. Distractors: exactly 3, plausible (e.g., confuse RoleBinding scope), with explanations citing misconceptions/standards.
  Explanations: tie to objectives/layers/active learning. Output: JSON array of 24 flashcards.'
