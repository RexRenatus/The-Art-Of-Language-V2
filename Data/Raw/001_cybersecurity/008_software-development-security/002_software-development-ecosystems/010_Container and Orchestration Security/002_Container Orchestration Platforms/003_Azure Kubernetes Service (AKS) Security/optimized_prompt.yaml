  discussion_prompt: 'Discuss the security trade-offs of enabling multi-tenancy in AKS (e.g., namespace isolation vs. performance
    overhead). In groups, debate: ''Is logical isolation via namespaces sufficient for enterprise multi-tenancy, or should
    dedicated clusters be mandated? Support with real-world breach examples.'''
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for university pedagogy (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding).
  Use this content:


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert learning_objectives array here]

  **Active Learning:** [Insert active_learning object here]

  **Scaffolding:** [Insert scaffolding object here]

  **Core Concepts (from research):** Container Security, Secure Supply Chain, Kubernetes Components (Pod Security Standards,
  Secrets), Azure Components (Defender for Containers, Azure Policy, Key Vault, NSGs, Entra ID), Multi-tenancy, CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmark (Levels 1-2 for hygiene/operational controls, 30+ checks), Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark.


  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly follow [Insert flashcard_schema here]. Mix formats: 20% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND (definitions),
  30% APPLY (configs/steps), 30% ANALYZE/EVALUATE (comparisons/critiques), 20% CREATE (designs). Balance scaffolding layers
  evenly.


  Output as JSON array of 50 objects, each with ''front'', ''back'' (nested answer/explanation/distractors), and ''metadata''.
  Ensure distractors are educationally valuable. Prioritize voter consensus: SMART objectives, completeness (full CIS details),
  hands-on links.'
