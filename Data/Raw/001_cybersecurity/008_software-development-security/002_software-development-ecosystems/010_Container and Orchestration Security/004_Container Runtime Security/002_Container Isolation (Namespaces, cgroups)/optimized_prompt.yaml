  peer_teaching: 'In pairs, one student explains four namespace types (e.g., PID: processes see only container PIDs; provide
    examples/non-examples like shared vs. isolated process trees) while the other covers cgroup hierarchies and resource controllers
    (CPU, memory). Switch roles, then quiz each other on key differences and real-world applications.'
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A microservice container is causing DoS on host memory. In small groups, design a cgroup v2
    configuration (using systemd or docker-compose) to limit memory/CPU, combined with namespace setup (user + network namespaces).
    Test in a lab environment with the ''stress'' tool, measure before/after metrics, and present mitigation effectiveness.'

    rules:
    - 'Plausible misconceptions: e.g., Confuse PID with UTS namespace; mix cgroup controllers (CPU vs. blkio).'
    - 'Common errors: Wrong command flags (e.g., `--cpu-limit` instead of `--cpu-shares`); outdated v1 vs. v2 syntax.'
    - 'Partial truths: e.g., ''Namespaces limit resources'' (no, that''s cgroups).'
    - 'Edge cases: VM comparisons (e.g., ''Full kernel isolation'' as distractor for namespaces).'
    - Generate 3 distractors per MCQ, ensure 25-33% learner error rate prediction.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Container Isolation (Namespaces,
  cgroups) under topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Development Ecosystems > 008_Container

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Research context: Container isolation via Linux namespaces (8 types: Mount/PID/Network/Cgroup/IPC/Time/UTS/User for resource
  partitioning) and cgroups (hierarchical resource limits/monitoring; v1/v2).
