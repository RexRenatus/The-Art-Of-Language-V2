active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a team relying on public registries like Docker Hub, debate the risks of malicious image swaps or
    tampering versus the costs of maintaining private registries. Propose a hybrid model that balances security, cost, and
    usability, citing real-world examples like SolarWinds supply chain attacks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    terms (e.g., ''confidentiality'' for ''integrity''), 2) Partial truths (e.g., scanning verifies authenticity but not fully),
    3) Outdated practices (e.g., no signing). Ensure distractors promote critical thinking and link to active learning activities.'
