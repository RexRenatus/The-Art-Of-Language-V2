active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the effectiveness of container image provenance tracking (e.g., SLSA +
    Cosign) versus traditional checksums or signatures in preventing real-world supply chain attacks like XZ Utils. What are
    the trade-offs in terms of complexity, adoption, and false positives? Support your arguments with examples from container
    ecosystems.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Base on voter-noted misconceptions: e.g., confuse container provenance with media (C2PA → distractor ''C2PA for photo
      signing'')'
    - 'Common errors: Wrong tools (e.g., ''GPG'' vs Cosign), outdated methods (checksums only), SLSA level mix-ups (L1 as
      ''full security'')'
    - 'Plausible but incorrect: e.g., For Cosign verify: A) Ignores attestations, B) Requires private key (keyless distractor),
      C) Checks runtime (build-time distractor)'
    - '3 distractors per MCQ: 1 superficially similar, 1 opposite/extreme, 1 unrelated but domain-adjacent (e.g., SBOM vs
      vulnerability scan)'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Container Image Security.
  Topic: Image Provenance Tracking (Level 6 in hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Development
  Ecosystems > 008_Container and Orchestration Security > 002_Container Image Security > Image Provenance Tracking). Focus
  exclusively on container/OCI/Docker images, NOT digital media (ignore C2PA; use SLSA, Sigstore Cosign, in-toto, Notation,
  SBOM, OCI artifacts). Incorporate real-world examples: SolarWinds, XZ Utils backdoors.


  Use these LEARNING OBJECTIVES [insert full list above]. Structure content via SCAFFOLDING LAYERS [insert full list above].
  Include ACTIVE LEARNING elements in explanations for context.


  Generate 40-60 high-quality flashcards following FLASHCARD SCHEMA [insert full schema above]. Ensure:

  - Balance: Bloom''s levels, scaffolding layers.

  - Distractors: Follow protocol precisely.

  - Pedagogy: Active recall, spaced repetition friendly; explanations scaffold from foundation to integration, link to prerequisites
  (PKI, containers).

  - Accuracy: Web-grounded (Sigstore docs, SLSA spec, Cosign GitHub, OCI standards RFC 8949).
