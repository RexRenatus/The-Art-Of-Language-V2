This ensures reproducibility and security, because the content is precisely identified.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The use case is not strictly divided by tag vs. digest. Digests do not inherently offer better compression. Cryptographic signing is associated with image integrity verification, often via digests or other signing tools, not mutable tags themselves.",
        "analogy": "Using a tag like 'latest' is like referring to 'the current mayor'; their identity can change. Using a digest is like referring to a specific person by their unique ID number; it always points to the same individual, regardless of any changes in their title or role."
