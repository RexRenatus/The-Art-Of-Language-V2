active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a service mesh like Istio, debate whether mutual TLS (mTLS) should always be enforced versus selective
    encryption. Consider trade-offs in performance overhead, security requirements (e.g., zero-trust models), real-world scalability
    in Kubernetes clusters, and compliance with NIST SP 800-52r2.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Distractor 3: Related but incorrect concept (e.g., ''Cipher suites handle certificate issuance'' instead of key exchange)'
