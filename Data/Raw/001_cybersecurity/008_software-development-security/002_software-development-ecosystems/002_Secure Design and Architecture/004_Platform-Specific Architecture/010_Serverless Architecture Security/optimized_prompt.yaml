  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains a key serverless risk (e.g., event data injection via unvalidated inputs)
    and its mitigations; the partner rephrases it as a teach-back using a real-world example from AWS Lambda or Azure Functions,
    then switch roles.
  problem_solving: Given a sample serverless IAM policy with wildcard permissions (*:*), analyze vulnerabilities, identify
    risks (e.g., blast radius from compromise), and redesign it for least privilege, incorporating conditions like source
    IP restrictions.

    - D3: Opposite or extreme (e.g., ''eliminates all IAM needs''). Base on voter-noted misconceptions, real-world errors
    from breaches, or confusable concepts (e.g., FaaS vs. PaaS). Ensure plausible to advanced learners.'

  Generate 40 high-quality flashcards (10 per scaffolding layer) optimized for spaced repetition and Bloom''s Taxonomy. Cover
  all learning objectives progressively. Integrate research context: Core concepts (serverless, FaaS, event-driven, stateless,
  ephemeral); Key risks (over-permissioned IAM, unvalidated inputs, injection, secrets, DDoS, observability); Standards (OWASP
  Serverless Top 10, AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar, CIS AWS Foundations, CSA CCM, NIST SP 800-53); Best practices (least
  privilege, input validation, secrets managers, monitoring).


  **Scaffolding**: Generate flashcards strictly by 4 layers:

  - Layer 1 Foundation (10 cards): Basics, big picture, prior knowledge.

  - Layer 2 Components (10 cards): Risks, frameworks.

  - Layer 3 Implementation (10 cards): Best practices.

  - Layer 4 Integration (10 cards): Advanced topics.


  **Learning Objectives Coverage**: Ensure even distribution across REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND (25%), APPLY/ANALYZE (50%), EVALUATE/CREATE
  (25%).


  **Active Learning Integration**: Embed hooks in explanations (e.g., ''Peer teach: Explain this risk to a partner'').


  **Output Format**: JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''tags'': [''Layer1'', ''Bloom-Remember'',
  ''Objective1'']}, ...]. Strictly follow flashcard_schema structure. Use distractor_protocol for MC. Make engaging, precise,
  no fluff.'
