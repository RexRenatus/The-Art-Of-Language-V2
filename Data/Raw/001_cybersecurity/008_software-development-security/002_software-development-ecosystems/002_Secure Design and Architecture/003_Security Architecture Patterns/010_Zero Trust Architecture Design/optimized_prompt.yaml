active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios would implementing Zero Trust Architecture provide greater security benefits compared
    to traditional perimeter-based security models? Debate the trade-offs in terms of cost, complexity, and user experience,
    using real-world examples like the SolarWinds breach.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Confuse ZTA with perimeter security (e.g., ''Relies on network firewalls only'').

    - Overstate simplicity (e.g., ''Single technology/product'').

    - Mix concepts (e.g., ''Grants broad access after initial login'').

    Ensure distractors are realistic errors from partial knowledge; explain why wrong in back.'

  Use the following to generate high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized flashcards:


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s Taxonomy):** [Insert full array from ''learning_objectives'']


  **Active Learning Context:** Incorporate elements like discussion on ZTA vs. perimeter (SolarWinds), peer analogies (airport
  security), problem-solving in hybrid clouds to inspire scenario-based cards. [Insert full from ''active_learning'']


  **Scaffolding Content (Progressive Layers):** [Insert full from ''scaffolding'']


  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly follow: [Insert full from ''flashcard_schema'']


  Generate 50 flashcards covering all objectives, layers, and types. Ensure university-level pedagogy: active recall, misconceptions
  via distractors, scaffolding progression. Draw from NIST SP 800-207/1800-35, research context (core concepts, tenets, phased
  implementation).


  Output ONLY a JSON array: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''layer'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''references'': ''...''}}, ...]
