active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue for or against a 'zero-tolerance' policy for Critical vulnerabilities (CVSS
    >9.0) in CI/CD pipelines across industries like finance vs. gaming. Use case studies like Log4j to support your position
    and reference NIST SSDF practices.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''CVSS Critical is <7.0''), 2) Confusable
      term (e.g., CWE vs CVE), 3) Extreme value (e.g., ''Block all vulns regardless of exploitability''). Ensure distractors
      are realistic based on voter/research errors like ignoring OSPS baselines.'
    count: Always 3 for MCQs; none for open-ended
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Vulnerability Threshold
  Management (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Development Ecosystems > CI/CD Pipeline
  Security > Continuous Security Testing > Vulnerability Threshold Management). Generate 50 high-quality Anki-style flashcards
  optimized for spaced repetition, covering all Bloom''s levels, active learning activities, and 4-layer scaffolding provided
  below. Ensure completeness (e.g., full OSPS Baseline: prevents unintentional commits to production via vuln gates), practical
  tools (Snyk, Dependabot, SonarQube, OWASP ZAP, GitHub Actions), case studies (Log4j, Equifax), standards (NIST SSDF SP 800-218,
  NISTIR 8011, OWASP SAMM), and prerequisites (CI/CD basics, vuln scanning).


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list above]

  **Active Learning:** [Insert full details above] – Weave in prompts/scenarios.

  **Scaffolding:** [Insert full 4 layers above] – Distribute cards: 15 Layer1, 15 Layer2, 10 Layer3, 10 Layer4.

  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly follow [Insert full schema above]. For MCQs: Question + 4 options (1 correct). Vary difficulty;
  include concept map elements.
