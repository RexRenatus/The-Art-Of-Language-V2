active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Analyze a provided CloudFormation template with intentional misconfigurations (e.g., public S3 bucket,
    unencrypted RDS, overly permissive IAM roles). In groups, debate which is the most critical vulnerability and why, referencing
    NIST or AWS best practices. Categorize them by attack surface impact to spark critical thinking on prioritization.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g., confusing service roles with
    user IAM; overlooking dynamic refs for hardcoded secrets), partial truths (e.g., permissive roles as 'flexible'), or edge
    cases (e.g., tools like cfn-lint as 'deployment-only'). Ensure distractors test nuance without being obviously wrong.
