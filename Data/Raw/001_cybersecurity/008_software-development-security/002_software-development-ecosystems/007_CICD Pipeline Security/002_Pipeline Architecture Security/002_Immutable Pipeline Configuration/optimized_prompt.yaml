active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of mutable vs. immutable pipeline configurations in a high-stakes
    software supply chain. Consider factors like development speed, security, and compliance with SLSA. Provide evidence from
    OWASP PPE risks and propose mitigations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    are faster'' vs. security risks); 2) Partial truths (e.g., SLSA Level 1 vs. Level 2); 3) Related but incorrect terms (e.g.,
    ''Mutable infra'' instead of immutable); 4) Voter-suggested risks (PPE types). Ensure distractors promote critical thinking.'
