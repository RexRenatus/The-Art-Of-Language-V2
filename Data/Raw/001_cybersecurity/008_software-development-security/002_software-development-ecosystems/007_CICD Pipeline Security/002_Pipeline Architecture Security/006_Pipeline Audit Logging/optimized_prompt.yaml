active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a DevSecOps environment, debate whether audit logging should capture every pipeline event or be selective
    based on risk levels. Use OWASP SPVS and CIS Control 8 to support arguments, considering trade-offs in privacy, storage
    costs, incident response speed, and compliance requirements like SOC2.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Completed Research Context:**

  Pipeline audit logging ensures visibility into CI/CD events for security. Core Concepts: Audit Logs (event records: commits,
  builds, deploys); Software Delivery Pipeline (stages: plan-code-build-test-release-deploy-operate); Artifact Integrity (tamper-proof
  artifacts); Operational Resilience (incident recovery); DevSecOps (integrated security); Security Maturity (practice evolution).

  Standards: OWASP Secure Pipeline Verification Standard (SPVS) - verifies secure pipelines with audit trails for traceability/integrity.
  CIS Critical Security Controls v8 Control 8: Audit Log Management - Collect logs from pipelines/endpoints; centralize storage;
  generate alerts on anomalies (e.g., unauthorized builds); retain for forensics (90 days-1 year); review regularly.

  Best Practices: Immutable/append-only logs; structured JSON/Syslog; SIEM integration (Splunk/ELK); risk-based granularity;
  retention policies.

  Examples: SolarWinds breach (supply chain logging gaps).

  Sources: OWASP SPVS (owasp.org/www-project-secure-pipeline-verification-standard); CIS Controls v8 (cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-list);
