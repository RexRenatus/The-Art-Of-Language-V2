  Voter Consensus: 82.9% approval (7 voters) on pedagogy/completeness enhancements.


  Use these EXACT elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: Incorporate discussion/peer/problem-solving into higher-Bloom flashcards (e.g., evaluative questions
  referencing debate).

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste the scaffolding_layers array here] – Distribute flashcards evenly.

  - Flashcard Schema: [paste the flashcard_generation_schema here] – Follow strictly.


  Content is grounded in OWASP DevSecOps, NIST SP 800-218, tools (SonarQube, Checkmarx, Semgrep), pipelines (GitHub Actions,
  Jenkins).


  Generate 30 flashcards in JSON array format: [{''front'': ''question'', ''back'': ''answer + explanation (cite layer/objective/source)'',
  ''bloom_level'': ''Remember'', ''layer'': 1, ''type'': ''definition''}, ...]. Ensure variety, no repetition, active recall
  focus, distractors plausible. Prioritize measurable verbs, real-world applicability.'
