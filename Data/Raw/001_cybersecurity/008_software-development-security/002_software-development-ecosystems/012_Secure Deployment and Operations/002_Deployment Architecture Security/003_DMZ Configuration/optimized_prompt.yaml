active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a debate format, argue whether a triple-firewall DMZ is necessary for high-security environments (e.g.,
    financial services) or if dual firewalls suffice, citing real-world breaches like the Equifax incident and addressing
    misconceptions about over-segmentation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Over-simplifications (e.g., no need for internal FW); 3) Real-world errors (e.g., unpatched DMZ services); 4) Confusable

  > Deployment Architecture Security > DMZ Configuration).


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema. Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE] – link each flashcard to one.

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE] – distribute flashcards: 6 Layer1, 6 Layer2, 7 Layer3, 6 Layer4.

  - Research Context: Use the DMZ summary (DMZ as buffer with dual firewalls for external services; traffic screening; complete
  ''Why Important'' with defense-in-depth, PCI-DSS).

  - Voter Priorities: Prior knowledge (networking basics), misconceptions/best practices, implementation steps, cloud integration.


  Output ONLY in JSON array of objects, each: {"front": "Question", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "... (pedagogy
  tie-in, e.g., ''Applies Layer2; addresses single-FW myth; links to debate'')", "distractors": ["opt1", "opt2", ...], "bloom_level":
