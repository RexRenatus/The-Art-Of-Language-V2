By restricting access to only what is necessary, it contains security incidents, preventing them from escalating into major business disruptions.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Least privilege is about restriction, not granting broad access. It primarily enhances security and reduces incident impact, not directly speeding up deployment. While it aids auditing, its core BCP contribution is limiting damage.",
        "analogy": "Least privilege is like giving each employee a keycard that only opens the doors they absolutely need to enter for their job; this prevents unauthorized access to sensitive areas if a card is lost or stolen."
