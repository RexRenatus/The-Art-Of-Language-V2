active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the application of Zero Trust principles to Azure Blob Storage. Debate whether it fully addresses
    risks in the Shared Responsibility Model, using real-world breach examples like public blob exposures. Discuss misconceptions,
    such as assuming cloud providers secure all data, and propose enhancements.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: (1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Cloud provider
    secures all data'' vs. Shared Responsibility); (2) Partial truths (e.g., ''SAS for authentication only'' ignoring authorization);
    (3) Confusable features (e.g., RBAC vs. ACL); (4) Outdated/insecure practices (e.g., storage keys over AAD). Ensure distractors
    are realistic from voter/research context.'

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list above]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [Insert full 4 layers above]

  - Active Learning: Draw from discussion/peer/problem-solving for scenario cards.

  - Prior knowledge: Link to cloud models (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS), IAM.

  - Key Features: Encryption (SSE/CMEK), SAS, RBAC, immutability, Defender for Storage, redundancy/DR.

  - Big Picture: Zero Trust in Shared Responsibility Model.


  Use this Flashcard Schema: [Insert full schema above]. Balance: 30% Remember/Understand (Layer 1), 30% Apply/Analyze (Layers
