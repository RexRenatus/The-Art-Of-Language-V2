  Generate flashcards following this EXACT SCHEMA: [PASTE FULL FLASHCARD_GENERATION_SCHEMA]. Ensure 50 cards total, optimized
  for Anki/spaced repetition (active recall, no cloze deletions unless specified). Tag each card with: Layer (1-4), Bloom''s
  Level, VoterPriority (e.g., pedagogy). Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''type'':
  ''...'', ''tags'': [''layer1'', ''remember'']}, ...]. Prioritize progressive complexity, voter consensus (e.g., tiers debate,
  mock dashboard), and measurable outcomes.'
