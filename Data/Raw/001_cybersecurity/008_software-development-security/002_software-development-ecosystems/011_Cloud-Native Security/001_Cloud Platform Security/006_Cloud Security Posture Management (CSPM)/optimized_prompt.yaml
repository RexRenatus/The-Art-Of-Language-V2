active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the effectiveness of CSPM in preventing configuration drift versus traditional on-premises security
    tools. Consider trade-offs in automation, cost, human oversight, and examples from recent cloud breaches like Capital
    One. Address the misconception that CSPM is 'set-it-and-forget-it'.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university-style pedagogy\
  \ (Bloom's Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic: Cloud Security Posture\
  \ Management (CSPM) in the exact topic hierarchy: 'Level 1: Cybersecurity > Level 2: Software Development Security > Level\
  \ 3: Software Development Ecosystems > Level 4: 013_Cloud-Native Security > Level 5: Cloud Platform Security > Level 6:\
  \ Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)'. Include this hierarchy verbatim in every flashcard.\n\n**Full Topic Content\
  \ (Synthesized & Completed from Research/Voter Consensus):**\nCSPM continuously identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and remediates\
  \ cloud security weaknesses, addressing configuration drift and dynamic attack surfaces. Core concepts: Security Posture\
  \ (overall status), Configuration Drift (baseline divergence), Attack Surface (entry points like exposed APIs).\nFour Phases:\
  \ 1. Discovery (asset inventory), 2. Evaluation (vs. CIS/NIST standards), 3. Prioritization (CVSS/impact), 4. Remediation\
  \ (workflows).\nTools: AWS Security Hub (insights/remediation), Prisma Cloud, Microsoft Defender for Cloud.\nKey Benefits:\
  \ Continuous monitoring, Risk prioritization, Compliance alignment, Vulnerability Management (identifies cloud-context vulns,\
  \ prioritizes beyond scanners), Cost savings (avoids breach costs).\nCase Study: Capital One breach (misconfigured WAF/S3\
  \ access).\nIntegration: With CNAPP/CWPP; automate via playbooks.\n\n**Scaffolding Layers:** Layer 1: Foundation (definitions).\
  \ Layer 2: Components (phases). Layer 3: Implementation (tools/scenarios). Layer 4: Integration (benefits/CNAPP).\n\n**Learning\
  \ Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives from above].\n\n**Active Learning Inspiration:** Draw questions from discussion\
  \ (CSPM vs. traditional), peer teaching (phase examples), problem-solving (AWS scenario).\n\n**Output:** Array of 25 JSON\
  \ flashcards, each strictly following this schema:\n{\n  \"question\": \"...\",\n  \"correct_answer\": \"...\",\n  \"distractors\"\
