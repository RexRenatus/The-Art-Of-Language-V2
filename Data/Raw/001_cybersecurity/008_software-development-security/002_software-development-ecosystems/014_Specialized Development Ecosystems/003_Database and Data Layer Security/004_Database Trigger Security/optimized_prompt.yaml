active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios would you use a database trigger for security enforcement (e.g., auditing) versus alternatives
    like stored procedures or application logic? Debate the pros (e.g., automatic enforcement) and cons (e.g., privilege risks,
    performance overhead).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3-4 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions: 1) Confuse DML/DDL. 2) Misstate
    execution context (e.g., ''always owner'' vs. ''caller''). 3) Overstate risks (e.g., ''triggers immune to injection'').
    4) Wrong mitigations (e.g., ''use dynamic SQL for safety''). Ensure distractors are realistic from research (e.g., SQL
    Server vs. Oracle differences).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university pedagogy (Bloom''s
  Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards on ''Database Trigger Security'' (Category:
  Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Development Ecosystems > 011_Specialized Development Ecosystems
  > Database and Data Layer Security > Database Trigger Security).


  **Research Context (Expanded):** Database triggers auto-execute on DML/DDL events but risk privilege escalation (e.g., DDL
  trigger grants CONTROL SERVER), recursion DoS, SQL injection via dynamic SQL, auditing leaks. Mitigations: EXECUTE AS SELF
  (SQL Server), least privilege, disable recursion, idempotency, code audits. Best practices: Minimal ops, RBAC integration,
  monitoring. Sources: docs.microsoft.com/sql/triggers, oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=db11g&id=REFRN10392.
