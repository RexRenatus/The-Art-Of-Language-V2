  evaluate:
  - objective: Evaluate the suitability of the ACE Framework for authentication and authorization in a given constrained IoT
      deployment.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  analyze:
  - objective: Analyze trade-offs between OSCORE and DTLS in IoT networks, considering overhead, end-to-end protection, and
      proxy compatibility.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  create:
  - objective: Design a secure CoAP implementation for an IoT sensor network, incorporating threat modeling, OSCORE, ACE,
      and COSE.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  understand:
  - objective: Explain the differences between application-layer security (OSCORE) and transport-layer security (DTLS) for
      CoAP, including their roles in proxy environments.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Apply OSCORE to secure a CoAP message exchange in a resource-constrained IoT device scenario.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  remember:
  - objective: Define CoAP, OSCORE, COSE, ACE Framework, Security Context, and Proof-of-Possession (PoP) in the context of
      IoT security.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between OSCORE (application-layer) and DTLS (transport-layer) security for CoAP
    in IoT networks with proxies. When does end-to-end protection outweigh overhead? Address common misconceptions like assuming
    DTLS always suffices for security.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors based on common misconceptions: 1) Confuse transport (DTLS/UDP) vs. application
    (OSCORE) layers; 2) Mix up protocols (e.g., COSE as transport security); 3) Overlook constraints (e.g., assume TCP/HTTP
    suffices); 4) Ignore proxies/end-to-end needs. Ensure distractors are plausible (e.g., real but incorrect RFCs or partial
    truths).'

  **Core Content from Research:** CoAP (RFC 7252): Lightweight HTTP-like protocol over UDP for IoT. OSCORE (RFC 8613): App-layer
  end-to-end security using COSE (RFC 8152) for crypto. ACE Framework (RFC 9200): Authn/authz for constrained envs. DTLS (RFC
  6347): Transport-layer security. Key concepts: Security Context, PoP. Sources: RFC 7252 (CoAP), RFC 8613 (OSCORE), RFC 8152
  (COSE), RFC 9200 (ACE), RFC 6347 (DTLS), IETF CoRE WG docs.


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full learning_objectives JSON here].

  - Active Learning: Inspire cards from discussion (OSCORE vs DTLS trade-offs), peer teaching (components), problem-solving
  (IoT sensor design).

  - Scaffolding: [Insert full scaffolding JSON here]. Prioritize progression: Foundation first, then Components, Implementation,
  Integration.

  - Big Picture: Emphasize IoT attack prevention.


  **Flashcard Generation:** Create 30 high-quality flashcards using exact schema: {type, front, back, explanation, hints,
  mcq_distractors (if MCQ)}. Follow distractor_protocol strictly. Ensure active recall (questions, not statements); university-level
  (Bloom''s progression); misconceptions addressed in explanations. Output as numbered JSON array. Vary types: 10 basic/cloze,
  15 MCQ, 5 scenario/application. Cover all layers/objectives evenly.'
