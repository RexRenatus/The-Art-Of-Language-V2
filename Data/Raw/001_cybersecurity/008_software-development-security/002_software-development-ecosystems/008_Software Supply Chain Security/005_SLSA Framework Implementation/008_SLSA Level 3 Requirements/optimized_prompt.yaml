active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of implementing SLSA Level 3 requirements (e.g., cost of
    hermetic builds vs. security gains). Use real-world examples like SolarWinds to argue for or against prioritizing L3 in
    enterprise CI/CD pipelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    ''basic auth'' vs. ''strict JIT''), 3) Confusions (e.g., mix L3 with L4), 4) Irrelevant but plausible (e.g., ''network
    isolation'' instead of ''build isolation''). Ensure 70% pass active recall tests.'

  **Topic Context:** SLSA Level 3 Requirements (Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Development Ecosystems
  > 015_Software 015_Supply Chain Security > SLSA Framework Implementation > SLSA Level 3 Requirements). Focus on Build track
  L3 per https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0.0-beta4/requirements#build-l3. Prerequisites: SLSA L1/L2, CI/CD basics.


  **Pedagogical Framework:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the ''learning_objectives'' array here].

  - Scaffolding: Generate 10 flashcards per layer from [Insert ''scaffolding'' object here]. Progress from foundation to integration.

  - Active Learning Tie-in: Infuse flashcards with discussion hooks (e.g., ''Why might this fail in prod?''), peer-teach examples,
  problem-solving scenarios.


  **Flashcard Generation:**

  Create exactly 50 flashcards (12-13 per scaffolding layer, balanced across Bloom''s levels: 20% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 30%
  APPLY/ANALYZE, 30% EVALUATE, 20% CREATE).

  Follow exact schema: [Insert ''flashcard_schema'' object here].

  Ensure completeness: Cover all L3 reqs (hardened platforms, strict access, reproducibility, hermetic, input verification,
  logging, etc.) with examples/pitfalls.

  Vary formats for active recall.


  **Output Format:** JSON array of objects, e.g., [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'':
  [''A: ...'', ''B: ...''], ''metadata'': {...}}, ...]. No extra text.'
