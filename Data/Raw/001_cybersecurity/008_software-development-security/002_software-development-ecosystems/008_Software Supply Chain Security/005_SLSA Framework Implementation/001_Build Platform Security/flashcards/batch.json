Each higher level builds upon the previous one, requiring more stringent controls. This works by defining specific requirements for source control, build processes, and provenance, allowing producers and consumers to understand and choose appropriate security postures.",

        "core_logic": "A strategic approach to SLSA adoption involves defining a target level and selecting tools/platforms that align with it.

This works by ensuring that the chosen build platform can natively support the desired security guarantees, facilitating a smoother transition.",
