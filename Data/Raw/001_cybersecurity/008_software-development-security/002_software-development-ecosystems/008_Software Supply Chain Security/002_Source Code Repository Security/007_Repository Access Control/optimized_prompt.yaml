  discussion_prompt: In a team of 20 developers contributing to an open-source repository, debate whether Role-Based Access
    Control (RBAC) or Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) is more effective for preventing unauthorized code merges. Use
    real-world examples like the Code Spaces breach or SolarWinds supply chain attack to support your arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  focus: ''
  content: 'Basic terms: Access Control (mediates subject-object interactions via policies), Repository (code/package storage),
    Subject (requester), Object (resource), RBAC (role-based), ABAC (attribute-based). Quiz: Match terms to definitions.'
- level: 2
  name: Layer 2

  content: 'Relationships: Policies evaluate subject attributes (e.g., role, location), object sensitivity, environment (time,
    IP). Compare RBAC (static roles) vs. ABAC (dynamic). Diagram: Subject → Policy Engine → Object. Just-in-time example:
    GitHub teams as RBAC.'

  focus: ''
  content: 'Practical steps: GitHub - Create teams/org roles (RBAC), Branch protection rules; GitLab - Groups/projects with
    custom roles, ABAC via external auth. Best practices: Least privilege, audit logs. Hands-on: Configure protected branches.'

    ''No policies needed for open-source''). Ensure plausible for cybersecurity learners.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Topic: Repository Access Control (Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Development Ecosystems > 015_Software 015_Supply Chain Security
  > Source Code Repository Security > Repository Access Control). Use this optimized learning prompt to generate high-quality
  flashcards.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert array from above]

  **Active Learning:** [Insert details from above] - Ensure flashcards support these (e.g., scenario Qs for problem-solving).

  **Scaffolding:** [Insert prior_knowledge, big_picture_context, concept_map, layers from above] - Cover all layers progressively.

  **Sources:** OWASP Access Control (owasp.org), OpenSSF Repo Security (repos.openssf.org), NIST ABAC (nist.gov), SLSA Framework.


  **Flashcard Generation Instructions:**

  - Base content on research: Core concepts (Access Control, Subject/Object/Policy, ABAC/RBAC), best practices (least privilege,
  GitHub/GitLab config), prevent supply chain attacks.

  - Follow Bloom''s progression: Mix levels per objectives.

  - Use Flashcard Schema exactly: JSON array output only. Vary types (definition, comparison, scenario, application). Include
  distractors for 50% as MCQs.

  - Make active: Include prompts linking to discussions/exercises (e.g., ''Debate trigger: ...'').

  - Optimized: Concise fronts (10-20 words), rich backs. Ensure measurable, scaffolded (Layer tags optional).
