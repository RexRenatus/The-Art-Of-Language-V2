active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, critique the limitations of SCW (e.g., language support, scalability for large
    teams) and propose improvements to enhance its role in building a developer security culture. Connect to shift-left security
    and real-world breach reduction stats (e.g., proactive training reduces vulnerabilities by up to 50% per industry reports).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    vs. proactive coding); 2) Partial truth (e.g., ''OWASP Top 10'' as a metric instead of SCW Index); 3) Unrelated/exaggerated
    (e.g., ''ISO 27001 certification'' vs. hands-on challenges). Ensure plausible to trained eye but incorrect for learners.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in the Secure Code Warrior
  (SCW) Platform (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Development Ecosystems > 001_Developer
  Security Culture and Training > Security Tools and Resources > Secure Code Warrior Platform). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s
  Taxonomy objectives [insert learning_objectives array here], active learning inspiration [discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving],
  and 4-layer scaffolding [insert scaffolding_layers here].


  Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards following this exact schema [insert flashcard_schema here]. Ensure completeness:
  Cover core features (Labs, Challenges, Leaderboards, Paths), metrics (SCW Index, Secure Score, vuln detection, benchmarking),
  proactive security, OWASP/CERT links, SDLC integration, security culture, shift-left. Voter consensus: 100% approval on
  pedagogy, completeness (complete metrics/Best Practices), scaffolding, big picture, concept map.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, e.g., [{''type'': ''...'', ''question'': ''...'', ...}]. No additional text.'
