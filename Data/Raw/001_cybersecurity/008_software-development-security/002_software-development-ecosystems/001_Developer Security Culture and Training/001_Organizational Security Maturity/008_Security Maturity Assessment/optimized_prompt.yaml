active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Using the OWASP SAMM framework, debate whether organizational culture or technical tooling has a greater
    impact on security maturity in software development teams. Provide examples from real-world breaches (e.g., Equifax, SolarWinds)
    to support your position and reference specific SAMM practices.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    SAMM Levels), (2) Partial truth/over-simplification (e.g., ''NIST is only for software dev''), (3) Opposite or unrelated
    (e.g., ''CMMC Level 5 is basic hygiene''). Base on common errors from breaches/SDLC pitfalls.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university pedagogy (Bloom''s
  Taxonomy, active learning, 4-layer scaffolding). Generate high-quality flashcards for topic: ''Security Maturity Assessment''
  (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Development Ecosystems > 001_Developer Security Culture

  **Full Research Context:** Security Maturity Assessment evaluates org cybersecurity in SDLC: processes, policies, tech,
  culture. Goals: identify gaps, improve resilience. Key concepts: Cyber Maturity Assessment (eval posture/capabilities [SentinelOne]),
  DevSecOps, Security Posture, Maturity Models.


  Frameworks:

  - NIST CSF 2.0: Risk-based (Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover); Tiers 1-4 (Partial-Informal to Adaptive).
  Voluntary, all sectors. [https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework]

  - OWASP SAMM v2: Software Assurance Maturity Model, Levels 0-3 (Improvised to Optimized); Streams: Governance, Design, Implementation,
  Verification, Operations. SDLC-focused. [https://owaspsamm.org/]

  - CMMC 2.0: DoD contractors, Levels 1-5 (Basic to Advanced); 17 practices/domains. [https://dodcio.defense.gov/CMMC/]
