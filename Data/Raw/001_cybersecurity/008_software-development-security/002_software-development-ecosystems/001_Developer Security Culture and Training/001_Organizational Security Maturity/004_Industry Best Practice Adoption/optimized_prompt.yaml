  Use this optimized pedagogy:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list from above].

  - Scaffolding: Generate flashcards evenly across 4 layers [Insert full scaffolding details].

  - Active Learning: Infuse flashcards with scenario-based questions linking to discussions/peer teaching/problems.


  Content Sources (complete research context):

  - NIST SP 800-218 SSDF v1.1: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-218r1 (Practices: PO, PS, PW, RV).

  - NIST CSF 2.0: https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework (Govern-ID-Protect-Detect-Respond-Recover).

  - Best Practices: Integrate security into SDLC – Planning (threat modeling), Design (secure principles/SBOM), Implementation
  (coding standards/reviews), Verification (SAST/DAST/monitoring), Release (SBOM/disclosure).

  - Focus: Developer culture, maturity progression, vulnerability mitigation.


  Output 50 flashcards in JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''correct_answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''source'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...''}}]. Follow schema exactly: MCQ with 4 plausible options (1 correct, 3 distractors
  per protocol). Ensure progression: 12 Layer 1, 13 Layer 2, 13 Layer 3, 12 Layer 4. High-quality, educational, no fluff.'
