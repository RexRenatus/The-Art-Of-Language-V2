active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of prioritizing CSSLP (defensive SDLC focus) versus CEH
    (offensive hacking skills) for a software development team. Use real-world breach examples (e.g., Equifax) to support
    arguments and evaluate which certification better fosters a 'security-first' culture.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) CEH=defensive (emphasize offensive); 3) Incomplete domains (wrong/missing CSSLP list); 4) No comparison (equate unrelated
    certs). Ensure 70% knowledge/understanding, 20% apply/analyze, 10% evaluate/create.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for the topic ''Security
  Certification Programs (CSSLP, CEH)'' in the hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Development
  Ecosystems > 001_Developer Security Culture and Training > Security Training Programs > Security Certification Programs
  (CSSLP, CEH).


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Active Learning: Use discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving to inspire integrative cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [insert full descriptions above].

  - Voter Priorities: Full 8 CSSLP domains with descriptions; dedicated CEH section (EC-Council, 20 domains like Footprinting,
  Scanning, Hacking, etc.); comparisons; formative assessments with MCQs/distractors/reflections.

  - Research: CSSLP by (ISC)² (secure SDLC focus); CEH offensive/ethical hacking.


  Follow EXACT flashcard schema [insert full schema above]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as an object with
  keys: front, back, distractors (array or object), bloom_level, scaffolding_layer, explanation, formative_assessment. Ensure
  completeness, pedagogical alignment, and misconception-based distractors. No extra text.'
