active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, select one secure coding practice from NIST SSDF (e.g., input validation). One student explains
    it with a code example; the partner teaches it back using a different scenario. Switch roles. Addresses misconceptions
    like 'security slows development'.
  problem_solving: Analyze a provided vulnerable code snippet (e.g., SQL injection or XSS from OWASP). Identify the flaw,
    explain the attack vector, and refactor securely. Test in a safe environment. Applies to real-world SDLC.

    - D1: Common misconception (e.g., ''Client-side validation is sufficient'' for input sanitization).

    - D2: Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Use blacklisting for inputs'' vs. whitelisting).

    - D3: Unrelated/confused concept (e.g., mix OWASP Top 10 risk with wrong mitigation).

    Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter-noted misconceptions (e.g., ''security slows dev'') and research (e.g.,
    archived OWASP links).'
