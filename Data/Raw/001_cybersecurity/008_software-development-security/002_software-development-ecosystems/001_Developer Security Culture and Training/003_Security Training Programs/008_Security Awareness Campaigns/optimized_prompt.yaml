active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges of implementing security awareness campaigns in agile vs.
    waterfall SDLC environments. Propose two tailored strategies per methodology and vote on the most effective, justifying
    with NIST SP 800-50 principles.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 1 based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse NIST SP 800-50 with SP 800-53).

    - 1 overly simplistic/general (e.g., ''email only'' vs. multi-channel).

    - 1 advanced but irrelevant (e.g., mix BSIMM with hardware security).

    Ensure distractors are 70-80% plausible to challenge Analyze/Evaluate levels.'
