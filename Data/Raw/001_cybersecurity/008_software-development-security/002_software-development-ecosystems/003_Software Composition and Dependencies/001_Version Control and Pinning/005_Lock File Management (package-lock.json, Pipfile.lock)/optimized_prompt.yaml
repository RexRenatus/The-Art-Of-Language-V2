active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains package-lock.json (npm structure, when to commit) while the other explains
    Pipfile.lock (Pipenv specifics, differences from pip). Switch roles and teach-back to the group, addressing misconceptions
    like confusing Pipfile.lock with standard pip.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A project has a vulnerable transitive dependency (e.g., via Log4j-like chain). Students generate/update
    lock files (npm install or pipenv lock), run audits (npm audit / pip-audit), fix by pinning safe versions, and simulate
    a PR review rejecting lock file deletion.'

    cases/risks (e.g., ''never commit lock files''). Ensure distractors are realistic from voter accuracy notes (e.g., Pipfile.lock
    ≠ pip) and web research.'
