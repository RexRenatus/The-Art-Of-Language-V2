active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the misconception that 'OSS is inherently secure' by analyzing real-world
    examples like Log4Shell. How does SCA address transitive dependencies and license risks in OSS-heavy applications (70-90%
    of codebases)? Link to prior knowledge of vulnerability management.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''OSS is always
    secure'' → distractor: SCA only for proprietary code); 2) Partial truths (e.g., confuse direct vs transitive deps); 3)
    Tool mix-ups (e.g., Snyk does no license scanning); 4) Standard errors (e.g., SPDX not a vuln scanner). Ensure 1 correct,
    others clearly wrong but realistic.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Software Development Security.
  Generate 25 high-quality Anki-style flashcards for the topic ''003_Software Composition Analysis (SCA)'' (Topic Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Development Ecosystems > 006_Software Composition and Dependencies
  > Third-Party Component Management > 003_SCA). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives [INSERT LEARNING_OBJECTIVES
  HERE], active learning ties [INSERT ACTIVE_LEARNING HERE], and 4-layer scaffolding [INSERT SCAFFOLDING HERE].


  Incorporate research context: SCA analyzes OSS/third-party components (70-90% of apps) for vulns/licenses/SBOMs; tools (Snyk,
  Black Duck, OWASP Dependency-Check); standards (OWASP SAMM, NIST SP 800-161r1/SSDF, ISO/IEC 27001, SLSA, CycloneDX/SPDX);
  risks (transitive deps, OSS myths); builds on vulns/deps/package mgrs.


  Strictly follow flashcard schema [INSERT FLASHCARD_SCHEMA HERE]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as: {''type'':
  ''[TYPE]'', ''front'': ''[FRONT]'', ''back'': ''[BACK]'', ''bloom_level'': ''[LEVEL]'', ''layer'': [1-4], ''objective_id'':
  [1-6]}. Ensure distractors are educationally valuable. Voter consensus: 100% approval on pedagogy/completeness.'
