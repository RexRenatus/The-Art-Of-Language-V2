active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare Snyk's developer-first vulnerability scanning approach with traditional security tools like Nessus
    or Qualys. Discuss trade-offs in speed, accuracy, false positives, and developer adoption within the SDLC.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse Snyk Open Source
    with Snyk Code), 2) Similar term/feature (e.g., MTTF vs. MTTR), 3) Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Snyk fixes vulns
    automatically'' vs. ''prioritizes/remediates''). Ensure 60% basic cards, 40% MCQ. Vary difficulty by Bloom''s level.'

  Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives [insert learning_objectives array here], active learning [insert
  active_learning object here], and 4 scaffolding layers [insert scaffolding_layers array here]. Use research context: Snyk''s
  developer-first platform scans code/dependencies/containers/IaC; reduces MTTF by 45%; types include Snyk Open Source (CVEs/licenses),
  Container (images), Code (SAST), IaC (configs). Sources: snyk.io/product/open-source, snyk.io/container, snyk.io/code, snyk.io/iac.


  Generate 50-100 high-quality flashcards following this schema [insert flashcard_schema here]. Ensure coverage: 20% Foundation,
  25% Components, 25% Implementation, 30% Integration; span all Bloom''s levels; embed active learning prompts/examples (e.g.,
  discussion trade-offs, peer teaching samples, problem-solving scenarios). Prioritize factual accuracy, active recall, spaced
  repetition best practices. Output as JSON array of flashcards, each with ''type'', ''front'', ''back'' keys.'
