active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between using scoped packages (e.g., @myorg/internal-lib)
    and explicit registry prioritization in .npmrc files for preventing dependency confusion attacks. Consider scenarios where
    one approach fails and propose hybrid solutions. Support arguments with real-world examples from tools like GitHub Dependabot
    or Socket.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs: Create 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g., for prevention: distractor
    ''Rely only on public registries'' vs correct ''Prioritize private via .npmrc''). Distractors must be realistic (e.g.,
    partial truths like ''Version pinning alone suffices'' when scoping is needed). Ensure 1 correct, no ''all/none'' traps
    unless pedagogically justified. Balance difficulty.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Dependency Confusion Attack
  Prevention (Category: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Development Ecosystems > 006_Software Composition
  and Dependencies > Dependency 011_Vulnerability Management > Dependency Confusion Attack Prevention).


  Incorporate this research context: Dependency confusion attacks exploit package managers (npm, PyPI, Maven) resolving internal-named
  packages from public registries (e.g., attacker uploads malicious ''internal-lib'' to npmjs; manager falls back/installs
  it, causing backdoors/exfiltration). Prevention: scoped packages (@org/internal-lib), .npmrc/pip.conf registry prioritization
  (registry=private only), namespace prefixing, version pinning, checksums/sigstore, monitoring (Socket, GitHub Dependabot).
  Integrate with CI/CD, SBOMs, SLSA.


  Voter priorities: Complete attack steps/explanations; emphasize prevention best practices.
