active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given recent supply chain attacks like SolarWinds or Log4Shell, debate whether all package repositories
    should mandate signing and verification. What are the trade-offs in terms of security, developer productivity, and adoption
    barriers? Consider prerequisites like basic cryptography knowledge.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol:
  - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: (1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Signatures only ensure confidentiality'');
    (2) Partial truth (e.g., confuses integrity with encryption); (3) Extreme/edge case (e.g., ignores non-repudiation).'
  - Base on voter priorities, research context, and real pitfalls (e.g., unsigned package risks).
  - Ensure 20-30% flashcards per layer, balanced across Bloom's levels.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Topic: Package Signing and Verification
  (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Development Ecosystems > 006_Software Composition and
  Dependencies > Package Repository Security > Package Signing and Verification). Use provided learning_objectives, active_learning
  activities, scaffolding layers, and flashcard_schema to create 100 high-quality flashcards.


  Incorporate:

  - University pedagogy: Bloom''s progression, active learning hooks (e.g., reference discussion in explanations).

  - Voter consensus: Tools (cosign, sigstore, npm), standards (SLSA, NIST, CA/Browser Forum), cases (SolarWinds, Log4Shell).

  - Research: Core concepts (code signing, digital signatures for integrity/auth/non-repudiation), provenance, attestation,
  supply chain.


  Structure output as JSON array of flashcards, each matching flashcard_schema (mix basic, cloze, MCQ). Distribute: 25% per
  layer. Follow distractor_protocol strictly. Ensure explanations link to objectives/layers, promote active recall. Prerequisites:
  Assume basic crypto. Output only valid JSON.'
