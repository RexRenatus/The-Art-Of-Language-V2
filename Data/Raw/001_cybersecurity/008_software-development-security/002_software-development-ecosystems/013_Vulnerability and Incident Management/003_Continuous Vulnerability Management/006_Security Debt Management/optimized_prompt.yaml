active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent should security debt be tolerated in agile development sprints? Debate using real-world
    examples like the Log4Shell vulnerability in Log4j, considering trade-offs between velocity and security.
  peer_teaching: 'Students pair up: Partner A explains security debt accumulation using a personal finance analogy (e.g.,
    high-interest loans from shortcuts); Partner B teaches back with an SDLC example (e.g., deferred vuln fixes in CI/CD).
    Switch roles and discuss misconceptions like ''security debt equals all bugs.'''
  problem_solving: Given a hypothetical app codebase with listed vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, outdated libraries),
    prioritize remediation using CVSS scores combined with business impact. Groups present prioritized lists and justify using
    risk scoring formulas.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Topic: Security Debt Management (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software
  Development Security > Software Development Ecosystems > 014_Vulnerability and Incident Management > Continuous 011_Vulnerability
  Management > Security Debt Management). Consensus: 68.6% approval from 7 voters emphasizing completeness, pedagogy, scaffolding.


  Research Context (complete): Security debt = implied rework cost from insecure shortcuts (subset of technical debt). Accumulates
  via deferred vulns in SDLC; ''interest'' = risk/breaches/costs. NIST CSF 2.0: Govern+6 functions (Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover)
  prioritize risks proactively. NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2 RMF: 7-step framework (Prepare, Categorize, Select, Implement, Assess,
  Authorize, Monitor) integrates security/risk into SDLC for debt management. Other: OWASP SSDF practices. Sources: NIST CSF
  2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), SP 800-37r2 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-37r2), SP 800-218 SSDF (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-218),
