active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of DAC''s owner discretion in a software development team:
    How does it enable flexibility but introduce risks like over-privileging? Use examples from Unix file permissions or Windows
    ACLs to support your arguments.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol:
    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse DAC owner control with MAC system labels;
      mix up ACL with RBAC roles; use similar but incorrect permissions like chmod 777 for least privilege).
    - Ensure distractors are 70% similar to correct answer in wording/structure for challenge.
    - Draw from risks (over-privileging), comparisons (MAC/RBAC), or truncated concepts (e.g., ISO 2700x series).
    - Avoid obvious wrongs; make them 'almost right' to test analysis.
