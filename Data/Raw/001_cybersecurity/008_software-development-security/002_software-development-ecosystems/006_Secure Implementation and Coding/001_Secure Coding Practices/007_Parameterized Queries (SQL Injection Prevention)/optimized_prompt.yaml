active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between parameterized queries, stored procedures, and Web
    Application Firewalls (WAFs) for SQLi prevention. Use real-world examples like the 2011 Sony Pictures breach to argue
    which is most effective in a secure SDLC and why.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g., 'String escaping alone prevents SQLi' – incorrect,
      as it's bypassable).
    - Use partial truths (e.g., 'Dynamic queries with validation' – flawed due to complexity).
    - 'Incorporate voter priorities: Language-specific errors (e.g., forgetting bindParam in PHP), outdated practices (e.g.,
      mysql_real_escape_string).'
    - Ensure distractors test higher Bloom's (analyze/evaluate) by mimicking subtle vulnerabilities.
    count_per_card: 3
    variety: Mix Q&A, cloze, code identification across 50-100 flashcards spanning all scaffolding layers.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom''s Taxonomy, active
  learning, and secure coding practices. Generate 80 high-quality flashcards on ''Parameterized Queries (SQL Injection Prevention)''
  in the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Development Ecosystems > 006_Secure Implementation
  and Coding > Secure Coding Practices > Parameterized Queries (SQL Injection Prevention).


  Incorporate:

  - Voter consensus: Code examples in Python (psycopg2), Java (PreparedStatement), PHP (PDO); contrast vulnerable dynamic
  queries; best practices (prioritize params, safe stored procs, input validation, avoid escaping); real breaches (Sony 2011);
  OWASP Top 10, SDLC, compliance (GDPR/PCI-DSS).

  - Research: SQLi via string concat; params as data (not code); sources (OWASP Cheat Sheet, NIST).

  - Learning objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE].

  - Active learning: Weave in discussion/peer/problem-solving elements.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute across 4 layers [INSERT FULL LAYERS FROM ABOVE].


  Use EXACT flashcard schema: Multiple-choice (1 correct, 3 distractors per protocol), front/back format. Output as JSON array
  of objects: [{''front'': {''question'': ''...'', ''options'': [...], ''correct'': ''A''}, ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'',
  ''explanation'': ''...'', ''code_example'': ''...'', ''reference'': ''...''}}, ...].

  Ensure spaced repetition friendly: Varied formats, progressive difficulty, explanations reference Bloom''s levels and layers.'
