active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the strengths and weaknesses of integrating security into the Spiral Model's
    Risk Analysis phase versus deferring it to later phases like in Waterfall. Use real-world examples from NIST SP 800-218
    (SSDF) to support your arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Base on voter-noted misconceptions: e.g., ''Security only in testing phase'' (Waterfall confusion), ''Spiral has 3
      phases'' (incomplete recall), ''No iteration in Spiral'' (vs. Agile).'
    - 'Make plausible: Use similar terms (e.g., SAST vs. DAST), partial truths, or reversed logic.'
    - Ensure 1 correct, others clearly wrong but educational.
    - 'Vary difficulty: Easy (obvious error), Medium (subtle mix-up), Hard (contextual trap).'

  Topic: Spiral Model Security Controls (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Development Ecosystems
  > 002_Secure Development Lifecycle Management > SDLC Methodologies and Integration > Spiral Model Security Controls). Use
  this comprehensive content:


  **Full Topic Content (Complete Phases per Voter Consensus):**

  - **Objectives Determination**: Define project goals, alternatives, constraints. Security: Identify security requirements
  (CIA triad), compliance (e.g., GDPR), initial threat landscape.

  - **Risk Analysis**: Identify/resolve risks via prototyping. Security: Threat modeling (STRIDE), risk assessment (NIST RMF),
  mitigation prototypes.

  - **Engineering/Development & Test**: Develop, code, verify prototype. Security: Secure coding (OWASP Top 10), SAST/DAST/IAST
  tools, secure unit/integration testing.

  - **Evaluation/Planning**: Review with stakeholders, plan next iteration. Security: Independent security audits, feedback
  loops, lessons learned (SSDF practices).


  Integrate NIST SP 800-218 (SSDF), SP 800-37 (RMF), DevSecOps for iterations. Voter priorities: Full phase coverage, Bloom''s
  progression, 4-layer scaffolding, active learning embeds.

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert scaffolding_layers array here]

  **Active Learning:** Embed hints in explanations (e.g., ''Discuss in peer teaching: ...'').


  Generate flashcards per **Flashcard Schema** exactly. Cover all phases, objectives, layers. Ensure distractors follow protocol.
  Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards, grouped by Bloom''s level sections (e.g., {"remember": [...], "understand":
  [...]}).'
