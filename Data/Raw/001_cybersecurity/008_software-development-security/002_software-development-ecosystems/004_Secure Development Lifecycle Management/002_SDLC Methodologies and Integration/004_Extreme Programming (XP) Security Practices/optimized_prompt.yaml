active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how XP's 'Courage' value—defined as the willingness to refactor code ruthlessly
    and delete unnecessary features—can prevent security debt accumulation. Provide examples from real-world breaches (e.g.,
    Equifax) and counterarguments on potential risks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 75 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema. Cover these learning objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives
  ARRAY]. Incorporate scaffolding layers: [INSERT scaffolding ARRAY]. Embed active learning hooks from: [INSERT active_learning
  OBJECT].


  Content foundation: XP values (Communication, Simplicity, Feedback, Courage: bold refactoring to delete insecure code, Respect);
  Practices (Pair Programming: security peer review; TDD: security tests first; Continuous Integration: early vuln detection;
  Refactoring: reduce debt; Collective Code Ownership). Align with NIST SSDF, OWASP SAMM, DevSecOps. Sources: AgileAlliance.org,
  AltexSoft.com, NIST SP 800-218, OWASP.org.


  Use exact flashcard_schema: Front/Back structure with answer, explanation (link to Bloom''s/security benefits/layer), blooms_level,
  3 distractors for MCQs (per protocol), references, active_hook. Mix card types for active recall. Ensure pedagogical progression:
  20% Layer 1/Remember-Understand, 30% Layer 2-3/Apply-Analyze, 30% Layer 4/Evaluate, 20% Create/integration.


  Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''blooms_level'':
  ''...'', ''distractors'': [''a'',''b'',''c''], ''references'': ''...'', ''active_hook'': ''...''}}, ...]. No extras.'
