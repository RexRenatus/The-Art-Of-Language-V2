active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Which 3 KPIs would you prioritize for a DevOps team integrating security (e.g., MTTR for critical vulnerabilities,
    % code SAST/DAST coverage, deployment frequency without high-severity issues), and why? How do they align with NIST CSF
    functions? Debate trade-offs in a group and vote on the top set.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs: 1 correct answer; 3 distractors that are plausible but incorrect: (1) Common misconceptions
    (e.g., treat metric as KPI), (2) Real KPIs from unrelated domains (e.g., financial KPI like ROI), (3) Similar but wrong
    values/examples (e.g., ''Mean Time to Detect'' instead of MTTR). Ensure distractors teach by contrast.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Software Development Security.
  Topic: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Security (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software
  Development Ecosystems > 002_Secure Development Lifecycle Management > Security Metrics and Reporting > Key Performance
  Indicators (KPIs) for Security). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities, 4-layer scaffolding,
  and flashcard schema to generate high-quality, spaced-repetition-optimized flashcards.


  Core Content: Integrate definitions (metrics: raw data e.g., vulns found; KPIs: strategic e.g., MTTR critical vulns, % SAST/DAST
  coverage, secure code review rate, vulnerability density, deployment freq w/o high-sev vulns, security debt ratio; KRIs:
  risk signals). Frameworks: NIST CSF (Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover), NIST SP 800-218, OWASP SAMM, DORA security
  adaptations. Best practices: SMART KPIs, CI/CD tracking, stakeholder communication, dashboards.


  Incorporate pedagogy: Objectives span Bloom''s (REMEMBER definitions, UNDERSTAND diffs/alignments, APPLY select for DevSecOps,
  ANALYZE compare NIST functions, EVALUATE critique sets, CREATE dashboards). Active learning: Weave in discussion (prioritize
  3 KPIs), peer teaching (KPI vs metric examples), problem-solving (Equifax: design 5 KPIs). Scaffolding: Balance cards across
  layers 1-4.


  Generate 50 flashcards in JSON array format, following schema exactly. Ensure variety: 40% MCQ (w/ distractors per protocol),
  30% Q/A, 20% cloze, 10% scenario/application. Cards must be accurate, educational, and engaging. Output ONLY the JSON array
  of flashcards.'
