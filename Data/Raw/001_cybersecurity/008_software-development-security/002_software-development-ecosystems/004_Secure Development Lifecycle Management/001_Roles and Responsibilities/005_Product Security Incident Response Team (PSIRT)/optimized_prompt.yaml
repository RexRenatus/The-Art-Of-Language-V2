active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare the roles and responsibilities of a PSIRT in a product-focused software company versus a cloud
    service provider. How does NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 influence their Detect-Respond-Recover processes? Debate pros/cons of
    centralized vs. distributed PSIRT models.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 30 high-quality flashcards on\
  \ 'Product Security 002_Incident Response Team (PSIRT)' in the domain of Software Development Security > Software Development\
  \ Ecosystems > Secure Development Lifecycle Management > Roles and Responsibilities.\n\nIncorporate:\n- Research context:\
  \ PSIRT manages product vulnerabilities (reports, assess, fix, communicate). Definitions: Incident (security violation/threat),\
  \ Vulnerability (exploitable weakness), Exploit (code abusing it). NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 (April 2025): Incident Handling\
  \ as CSF 2.0 Profile – Phases: Detect (identify), Respond (contain/eradicate), Recover (restore), Improvement (lessons).\
  \ Sources: NIST.gov/sp800-61r3, CSF 2.0.\n- Provided learning_objectives, active_learning prompts/exercises, and scaffolding\
  \ layers exactly.\n- Link to prior: PSIRT extends SDLC roles like Security Champions to post-dev incidents.\n- Voter priorities:\
  \ Cover Log4Shell scenario, centralized/distributed debates, full NIST details.\n\nOutput ONLY a JSON array of 30 flashcards.\
  \ Ensure even distribution: 5 per Bloom's level, 7-8 per layer. Balance multiple-choice style with Q&A. Strictly follow\
  \ flashcard_schema: snake_case, exactly 3 distractors per card (with text/explanation), exact topic_hierarchy array.\n\n\
  Example flashcard structure:\n{\n  \"question\": \"Define PSIRT.\",\n  \"answer\": \"Dedicated team for product security\
  \ incidents.\",\n  \"distractors\": [\n    {\"text\": \"General IT helpdesk\", \"explanation\": \"Incorrect; PSIRT is product-specific\
  \ per NIST, not general support.\"},\n    {\"text\": \"Penetration testing team\", \"explanation\": \"Wrong; PSIRT handles\
  \ incidents post-release, not proactive testing.\"},\n    {\"text\": \"Compliance auditors\", \"explanation\": \"Misconception;\
  \ focuses on response, not audits (NIST CSF Detect).\"}\n  ],\n  \"explanation\": \"PSIRT ensures product integrity via\
  \ NIST phases...\",\n  \"bloom_level\": \"REMEMBER\",\n  \"scaffolding_layer\": 1,\n  \"topic_hierarchy\": [\"Level 1: Cybersecurity\"\
  , \"Level 2: Software Development Security\", \"Level 3: Software Development Ecosystems\", \"Level 4: 002_Secure Development\
  \ Lifecycle Management\", \"Level 5: 003_Roles and Responsibilities\", \"Level 6: Product Security 002_Incident Response\
  \ Team (PSIRT)\"]\n}\n\nEnsure questions promote active recall, explanations scaffold learning, distractors teach via errors."
