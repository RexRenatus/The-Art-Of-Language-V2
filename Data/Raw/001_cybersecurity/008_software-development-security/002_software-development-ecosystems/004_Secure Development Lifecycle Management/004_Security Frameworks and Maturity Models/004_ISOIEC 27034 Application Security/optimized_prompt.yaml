  Incorporate this research context: ISO/IEC 27034 provides guidance on application security, integrating into SDLC via ASMP
  (central process), ASCs (controls), for sensitive apps. Distinguish from ISO 27001. Parts include guidelines for processes,
  controls. Best practices: Threat modeling, secure coding, verification. Sources: ISO/IEC 27034-1:2011 (https://www.iso.org/standard/44378.html),
  OWASP ASVS v4.0.3 (https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/), NIST SP 800-218 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/218/fpd),
  CIS Controls v8 (https://www.cisecurity.org/controls).
