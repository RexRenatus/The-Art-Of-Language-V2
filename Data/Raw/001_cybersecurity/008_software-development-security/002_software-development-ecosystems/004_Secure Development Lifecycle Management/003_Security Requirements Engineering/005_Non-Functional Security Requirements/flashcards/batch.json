          "text": "Scalability",

        "core_logic": "Robustness in AI is a critical non-functional security requirement ensuring the model behaves predictably and securely even when faced with adversarial inputs, noisy data, or unexpected conditions. This prevents the AI from being easily manipulated or causing unintended harm.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors represent other important quality attributes but do not capture the essence of an AI's resilience to manipulation or unexpected operational environments, which is the core of robustness.",
        "analogy": "Robustness in an AI is like a skilled driver who can handle unexpected road conditions (potholes, sudden stops) without losing control of the vehicle."
