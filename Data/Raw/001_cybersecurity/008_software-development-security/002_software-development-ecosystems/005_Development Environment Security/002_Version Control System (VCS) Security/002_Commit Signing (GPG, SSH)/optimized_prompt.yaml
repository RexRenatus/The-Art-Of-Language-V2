active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between GPG and SSH for commit signing in a large open-source
    project. Consider security, ease of use, and maintenance overhead. Provide evidence from real-world examples like GitHub's
    verification badges.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    GPG expiration vs. SSH, public key for signing). Ensure variety: 1 factual error, 1 conceptual mix-up, 1 edge-case oversight.

  Topic: Commit Signing (GPG, SSH) in Version Control System (VCS) Security (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development
  Security > Software Development Ecosystems > 003_Development Environment Security > VCS Security > Commit Signing).


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL ARRAY FROM ''learning_objectives'']

  - Active Learning: Use for inspiration (e.g., flashcards simulating discussions/problems).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards evenly across 4 layers: [PASTE FULL ''scaffolding_layers'' DETAILS]. Include ''Prior
  Knowledge'' (Git basics, public-key crypto) in Layer 1.

  - Big Picture: Emphasize role in secure SDLC, preventing supply chain attacks (e.g., SolarWinds), traceability/auditability.

  - Completeness: Full coverage of GPG (key gen, expiration, revocation) and SSH (simple setup, no expiration, Git 2.34+,
  pros: easier key mgmt; cons: less subkey support). Include setup steps, comparisons, best practices (e.g., key rotation,
  secure storage, CI/CD).

  - Research: Base on core concepts (signing for authenticity/integrity, key pairs, verification), GPG/SSH mechanisms.


  Generate 40 flashcards strictly following the schema: [PASTE FULL ''flashcard_schema'' DETAILS].

  Output ONLY a JSON array of objects. No additional text. Ensure snake_case, valid JSON, exactly 3 distractors per card,
  balanced Bloom''s/layers/GPG-SSH.'
