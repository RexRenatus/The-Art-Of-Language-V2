      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "PAM solutions enhance cloud security because they offer a robust mechanism for managing secrets, moving them out of code and configuration files into a secure vault, and controlling access dynamically, thereby preventing exposure and unauthorized use.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Embedding secrets in code and using environment variables are insecure practices. Relying only on default cloud settings is insufficient for sensitive secrets.",
        "analogy": "PAM for cloud secrets is like a secure key management system for a smart building, where access to critical functions (like unlocking doors) is controlled and logged, rather than leaving keys lying around."
