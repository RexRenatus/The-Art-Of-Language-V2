active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a software development team, debate the security trade-offs of implementing a jump server versus a
    full VPN solution for accessing development infrastructure. Consider factors like usability, auditability, and attack
    surface.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
