  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, share real-world examples of exploited IDE plugin vulnerabilities (e.g., malicious
    VS Code extensions stealing credentials or IntelliJ plugins used in supply chain attacks). Debate: How do these fit into
    broader software supply chain risks like EO 14028 mandates? Propose one preventive measure per participant.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in IDE Plugin Security Assessment
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Development Ecosystems > 003_Development Environment
  Security > IDE Security > IDE Plugin Security Assessment).


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the 6 objectives above]

  - Active Learning: Use for higher-order cards (e.g., discussion-inspired analysis).

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste the 4 layers above, including completed NIST C-SCRM, examples, sources]. Sources: NIST SSDF
  (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-218.pdf), NIST C-SCRM SP 800-161r1 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-161r1.pdf),
  CISA KEV (https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog), JetBrains Security (https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/security.html),
  VS Code Marketplace Risks (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_security).

  - Prior knowledge: Anchor to IDE basics, vulns.

  - Big picture: Secures dev ecosystems per EO 14028.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following the Flashcard Schema exactly. Ensure progression: 5-8 per lower layers, increasing
  complexity. Use active recall, spaced repetition best practices (concise fronts, detailed backs). Vary formats. Output as
  a JSON array of card objects.'
