active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the balance between automation (e.g., CI/CD gates with OPA) and human oversight in policy enforcement.
    Reference NIST CSF Protect vs. Detect functions and real-world failures like the Equifax breach. Argue which approach
    is more scalable for software development ecosystems.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Context and Research Summary (Complete and Expanded):** Policy enforcement mechanisms ensure security policies are applied
  in software development, automating compliance to reduce vulnerabilities. Core concepts: Security policies (rules for secure
  coding/access), enforcement (controls to prevent violations), automation (real-time checks). NIST CSF: Supports Protect
  (safeguards like RBAC/CI/CD gates) and Detect (monitoring). NIST SP 800-53: Controls include AC-6 (Least Privilege), AU-2
  (Audit Events), CM-2 (Baseline Config), RA-5 (Vulnerability Scanning). Other frameworks: OWASP SAMM (practices like Security
  Testing), CIS Controls (e.g., 7: Continuous Vulnerability Management). Tools: Policy as Code (OPA, Terraform Sentinel),
  CI/CD gates (SAST/DAST in GitHub Actions/Jenkins), runtime (SELinux/AppArmor, Istio). Builds on prior: Security Policy Management
  (definition before enforcement). Sources: NIST CSF v2.0, SP 800-53 Rev5, OWASP SAMM v2, CIS Controls v8.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives from above].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers from above]. Ensure coverage across layers.


  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Cards should reference activities, e.g., ''Relate to debate: Automation pros/cons?'' or ''Scenario
  from problem-solving exercise.''


  **Output Format:** JSON array of 30-40 flashcards, each as: {"front": "...", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...",
  "hints": ["..."]}, "metadata": {"bloom_level": "...", "layer": 1-4, "tags": [...]}}. For MCQ, include distractors in explanation.
  Follow flashcard_schema exactly. Prioritize accuracy, variety, and pedagogical depth. No duplicates; make challenging yet
