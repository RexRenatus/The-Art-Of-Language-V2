  Generate 25-35 high-quality flashcards per EXACT schema: JSON array of objects with ''id'', ''type'' (MCQ/Definition/Cloze/Scenario),
  ''front'', ''options'' (MCQ only), ''correct_answer'', ''explanation''. Balance: All objectives/layers covered; distractors
  per protocol (plausible, misconception/edge-related). Ensure university-level: precise, no fluff, active recall. Output
  ONLY the JSON array.'
