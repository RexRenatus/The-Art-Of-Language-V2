  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains a specific safeguard (e.g., adequacy decisions, SCCs, or BCRs) to their partner
    using a real software development scenario (e.g., transferring user data to a US cloud provider), then switch roles and
    provide feedback.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: An EU-based software firm wants to use US cloud services (e.g., AWS) for processing personal
    data. Develop a step-by-step compliant data transfer plan, including adequacy checks, safeguards, TIAs, and cybersecurity
    integrations like encryption.'
