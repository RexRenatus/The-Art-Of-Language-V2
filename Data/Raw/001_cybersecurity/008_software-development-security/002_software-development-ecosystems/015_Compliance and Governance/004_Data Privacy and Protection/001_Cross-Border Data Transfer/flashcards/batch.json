        {
          "text": "It mandates specific data transfer protocols like SFTP for all international data movements.",

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) supports cross-border data transfer security because its risk-based approach helps organizations identify, protect, detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity risks, which are integral to securing data during international transfers, even though it doesn't specify transfer mechanisms.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The first distractor incorrectly assumes the CSF mandates specific protocols. The second overstates its scope by claiming automatic compliance with data transfer laws. The third confuses cybersecurity with data localization.",
        "analogy": "The NIST CSF is like a general 'safety manual' for a factory (organization); it helps ensure all operations, including shipping goods internationally (data transfers), are conducted with appropriate safety measures, but it doesn't dictate the specific shipping routes or customs paperwork."
