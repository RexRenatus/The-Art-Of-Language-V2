active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a small group, debate whether FISMA compliance creates excessive burdens for software developers working
    with federal agencies or if it is essential for protecting national security. Support your position with specific NIST
    SP 800-53 Rev. 5 controls (e.g., access control family) and real-world breach examples like the 2021 SolarWinds incident.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs: 1 correct answer + 3 distractors. Distractors must be plausible (e.g., common misconceptions
    like ''FISMA only applies to agencies, not contractors'' or outdated versions like ''SP 800-53 Rev 4''); derive from related
    concepts (e.g., HIPAA for healthcare, GDPR for privacy); avoid randomness—base on research context or voter priorities;
    ensure 1-2 distractors are ''close but wrong'' (e.g., swap Rev 4/5).'
