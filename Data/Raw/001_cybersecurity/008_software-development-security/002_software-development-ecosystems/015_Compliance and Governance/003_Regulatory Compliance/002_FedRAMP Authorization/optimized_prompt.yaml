active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In groups, debate whether FedRAMP authorization creates unnecessary barriers to innovation for cloud
    providers serving federal agencies. Use real-world examples like AWS GovCloud or Microsoft Azure Government to argue for
    or against, considering security, cost, agility, and compliance trade-offs. Synthesize key insights as a group position
    statement.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (20-30% of cards), create 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions: 1) Partial
    truths (e.g., ''FedRAMP Ready grants full ATO'' – confuses designations), 2) Related but wrong terms (e.g., ''FISMA''
    instead of ''FedRAMP'' for cloud-specific), 3) Inverse concepts (e.g., ''One-time assessment'' vs. ''Continuous Monitoring'').
    Ensure distractors are realistic from research context or voter-noted errors.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in FedRAMP Authorization (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Development Ecosystems > 016_Compliance and Governance
  > Regulatory Compliance > FedRAMP Authorization). Use the provided research context, voter consensus (100% approval on completeness/pedagogy),
  NIST SP 800-53 controls baseline, RMF/FISMA integrations, and DoD Impact Levels for accuracy.


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Active Learning: [insert summaries of discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving]

  - Scaffolding: Generate flashcards distributed across 4 layers – 25% Layer 1 (Foundation), 25% Layer 2 (Components), 30%
  Layer 3 (Implementation), 20% Layer 4 (Integration) [insert full layer descriptions].


  Follow this exact Flashcard Schema: [insert full schema above]. Ensure completeness: Cover truncated NIST SP 800-53 (security
  controls catalog for moderate/high baselines), full sources (FedRAMP.gov, NIST SP 800-53 Rev5, FISMA 2014, RMF SP 800-37),
  concept map elements, and real-world examples (AWS GovCloud, Azure Government).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 40-60 flashcards, no additional text. Make cards optimized for Anki/spaced repetition: concise
  fronts, atomic facts, high-yield for certification (e.g., CISM, CISSP).'
