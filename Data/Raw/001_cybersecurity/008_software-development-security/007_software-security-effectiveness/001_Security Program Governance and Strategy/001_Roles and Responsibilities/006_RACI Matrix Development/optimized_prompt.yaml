active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the assignment of RACI roles in a scenario where a critical security vulnerability is discovered
    during a software release cycle. For example, should the development lead be Accountable (A) or only Responsible (R) for
    the fix, and why? Consider team dynamics, potential bottlenecks, and common misconceptions like confusing Responsible
    and Accountable roles.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste array above]

  - Active Learning: [summarize: discussion on vuln scenario, peer teaching matrix, group NIST RMF exercise]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste full layers above, including example table/concept map]

  - Research: RACI clarifies roles in sec (minimize confusion, accountability); integrates NIST RMF, ISO 27001 (A.5.1 roles),
  SOC 2 (CC6.1 access), DevSecOps.
