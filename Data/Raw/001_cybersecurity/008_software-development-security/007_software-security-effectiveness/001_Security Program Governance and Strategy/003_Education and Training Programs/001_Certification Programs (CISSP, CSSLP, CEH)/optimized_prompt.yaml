active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of pursuing CISSP versus CSSLP for a software development
    team focused on secure SDLC integration. Use real-world examples from threat modeling or secure coding to support arguments,
    and vote on the best certification for a mid-sized fintech company.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (2) Plausible alternatives (e.g., similar cert names or phases); (3) Partial truths (e.g., correct for another cert/SDLC
    phase). Ensure one distractor is a frequent exam trap from official outlines. Balance difficulty: easy (obvious wrong),
    medium (requires recall), hard (requires analysis).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Software Development Security.
  Use the following to create 25 high-quality flashcards on ''Certification Programs (CISSP, CSSLP, CEH)'' in the topic hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Security Effectiveness > Security Program 001_Governance and Strategy
  > Education and Training Programs > Certification Programs (CISSP, CSSLP, CEH).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert full descriptions above], ensuring flashcards progress from Layer 1 to 4.

  - Active Learning: Draw from discussion/activities for scenario-based cards.

  - Core Concepts: Full SDLC (Requirements, Design, Implementation, Verification, Maintenance); CIA Triad in software; Threat
  Modeling (STRIDE); Secure Coding (input validation, etc.). Sources: isc2.org/certifications/cissp, isc2.org/certifications/csslp,

  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: Output as JSON array of objects with ''front'', ''back'' (answer, explanation, distractors),
  ''metadata''. Use distractor protocol. Ensure pedagogical alignment: measurable, active recall, spaced repetition friendly.
  Vary difficulty per Bloom''s. No duplicates; cover all cert domains/SDLC phases.'
