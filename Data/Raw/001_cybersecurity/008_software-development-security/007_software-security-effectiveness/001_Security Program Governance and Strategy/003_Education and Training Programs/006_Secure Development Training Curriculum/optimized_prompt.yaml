active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given limited training time, should secure development curricula prioritize OWASP Top 10 awareness or
    hands-on threat modeling? Argue your position using real-world breach examples like Log4Shell or SolarWinds, considering
    factors such as developer experience levels and organizational risk profile.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE, including prerequisites and transitions]

  - Core Concepts: Secure Development, SSDLC, AppSec, OWASP Top 10/ASVS/Developer Guide, NIST SP 800-218 SSDF, Threat Modeling
  (STRIDE), Secure Coding, breaches (Log4Shell, SolarWinds).

  - Formative Assessments: Include MCQs on misconceptions, short answers on threat modeling, SSDLC application scenarios,
  self-reflection prompts.

  - Sources: OWASP.org (Top 10, ASVS, Developer Guide), NIST SP 800-218 SSDF.


  Generate 40 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema:

  {front: "...", back: {answer: "...", explanation: "...", references: "...", bloom_level: "...", scaffolding_layer: "...",
  distractors: [...] (for MCQs)}}


  Ensure progressive coverage: 10 cards per scaffolding layer, spanning all Bloom''s levels. Use active learning for scenario-based
  cards (e.g., discussion debates as prompts). Distractors per protocol. Output as a JSON array of objects. Make explanations
  educational, tying to pedagogy for spaced repetition and active recall.'
