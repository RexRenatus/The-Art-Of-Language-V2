active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss common misconceptions about Security Roadmaps (e.g., viewing them as static checklists rather
    than dynamic, iterative strategies) and share real-world examples or non-examples from your organization's DevSecOps practices.
    How does this impact software security effectiveness?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    guidelines:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs based on common misconceptions (e.g., 'static checklist' vs. 'dynamic strategy'),
      partial truths, or related but incorrect concepts (e.g., tactical vs. strategic).
    - Ensure distractors test deeper understanding (e.g., confuse NIST CSF with CIS Controls).
    - 'Balance difficulty: 1 easy (obvious wrong), 1 medium (superficially similar), 1 hard (requires analysis).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Security Roadmap Development''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Security Effectiveness > Security Program 001_Governance
  and Strategy > Security Strategy and Metrics > Security Roadmap Development). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy,
  active learning, 4-layer scaffolding (Foundation: definitions/prereqs; Components: elements/frameworks like NIST CSF 2.0,
  OWASP SAMM/ASVS, CIS Controls, ISO 27001; Implementation: step-by-step process; Integration: DevSecOps/continuous improvement).
  Incorporate voter priorities: completeness with full sources (NIST: https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework; OWASP SAMM: https://owaspsamm.org/;
  ASVS: https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/; CIS: https://www.cisecurity.org/controls;
  ISO 27001: https://www.iso.org/standard/27001; CISA: https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cybersecurity-best-practices), misconceptions,
  real-world examples.
