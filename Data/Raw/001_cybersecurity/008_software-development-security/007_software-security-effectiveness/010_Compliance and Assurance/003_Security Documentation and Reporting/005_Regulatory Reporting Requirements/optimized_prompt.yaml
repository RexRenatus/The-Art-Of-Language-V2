active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what ways do regulatory reporting requirements enhance or hinder software security effectiveness?
    Debate using examples from NIST CSF 2.0 (e.g., Govern function reporting) and CMMC 2.0 (e.g., Level 2 affirmations), addressing
    misconceptions that compliance alone ensures security.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 25 high-quality Anki-style flashcards
  on ''Regulatory Reporting Requirements'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Security
  Effectiveness > 010_Compliance and Assurance > Security Documentation and Reporting > Regulatory Reporting Requirements).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full list above]

  - Active Learning: Use discussion/problem-solving for scenario cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [paste scaffolding above].

  - Research Context: NIST CSF 2.0 (Feb 2024, 6 functions), CMMC 2.0 (3 levels detailed above), sources (NIST.gov, cmmc.osd.mil).


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly [paste schema above]. Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'':
  ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''d1 (reason)'',
  ''d2 (reason)'', ''d3 (reason)'']}}]. Ensure pedagogical depth: active recall, spaced repetition, measurable verbs. No duplicates;
  cover voter priorities (completeness on CMMC, trade-offs).'
