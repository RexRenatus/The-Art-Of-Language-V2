active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between continuous compliance monitoring (CCM) and traditional periodic audits
    in a DevSecOps pipeline. Use examples from NIST SP 800-137, recent data breaches (e.g., SolarWinds), and CISA guidance
    to argue when CCM prevents failures that audits miss, considering costs, effectiveness, and scalability.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
