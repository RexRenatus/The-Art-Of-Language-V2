  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Third-party vendors represent a greater cybersecurity
    risk than internal threats in software development.'' Use examples from recent supply chain attacks (e.g., SolarWinds)
    and frameworks like NIST SP 800-161 to support your position, encouraging critical analysis of risk prioritization.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Security Effectiveness > 010_Compliance and Assurance
  > 012_Third-Party and Vendor Management > Third-Party Risk Evaluation). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for
  Anki/Quizlet using university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (balance levels), active learning (tag for activities), scaffolding
  (Layers 1-4), and voter consensus (include NIST SP 800-161, ISO 27001/28000, SIG, CIS Controls; fix SCRM as broader encompassing
  TPRM; practical steps like questionnaires/audits/monitoring; concept map: Central ''Third-Party Risk Evaluation'' → TPRM/VRM/TPCRM/SCRM
  → risks/frameworks → SCRM/compliance).


  Key content: Definitions (TPRM: structured external risk mgmt; VRM: vendor-specific; TPCRM: cyber-focus; SCRM: supply chain
  incl. TPRM); Risks (cyber/operational/regulatory); Frameworks as above; Process (identify/assess/score/mitigate/monitor);
  Integration (SCRM, automation, SDLC).
