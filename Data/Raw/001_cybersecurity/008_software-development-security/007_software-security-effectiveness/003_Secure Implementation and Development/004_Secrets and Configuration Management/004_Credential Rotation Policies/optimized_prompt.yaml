active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains rotation triggers (time-based vs. event-based) and tools (e.g., HashiCorp
    Vault), including a diagram; partner provides teach-back with questions. Switch roles and discuss misconceptions like
    'strong passwords never need rotation.'
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: An API key is leaked in a public GitHub repo. In small groups, design a response plan including
    immediate rotation steps, automation setup with a tool like AWS Secrets Manager, stakeholder notifications, and preventive
    measures for CI/CD integration.'

    not API keys''). Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter-noted errors or research gaps; avoid obvious wrongs.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Credential Rotation Policies''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Security Effectiveness > Secure 005_Implementation
  and Development > Secrets and Configuration Management > Credential Rotation Policies). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards
  (20 basic Q&A, 20 MCQs, 10 True/False) optimized for Anki/Quizlet, spanning Bloom''s Taxonomy via these learning objectives:
  [insert learning_objectives array]. Incorporate active learning hooks (e.g., ''Debate this: ...'') and 4-layer scaffolding:
  [insert scaffolding object]. Use research context: NIST SP 800-63B/800-63-4 (authenticator management, no fixed rotation
  but event/time-based guidance), CIS benchmarks (90-day passwords), tools like HashiCorp Vault/AWS Secrets Manager; best
  practices: automate, least privilege, monitor compromises.


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"type": "MCQ|Q&A|TF", "front": "Question text", "back": {"answer":
  "...", "explanation": "...", "references": ["NIST SP 800-63B"], "related_objective": "REMEMBER: Define...", "scaffolding_layer":
  "Layer 1"}}. Follow flashcard_schema exactly: [insert flashcard_schema object]. Ensure progressive coverage (10 cards per
  Bloom''s pair: lower/apply/upper), distractors per protocol, voter consensus (e.g., complete best practices, pedagogy).
  Prioritize university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition, misconceptions.'
