      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Credential stuffing occurs when attackers use automated tools to test large numbers of stolen credentials (often from previous data breaches) against various online services. Rotation mitigates this by ensuring that if a credential is stolen, its validity period is limited, thus preventing its long-term use in stuffing attacks.",
