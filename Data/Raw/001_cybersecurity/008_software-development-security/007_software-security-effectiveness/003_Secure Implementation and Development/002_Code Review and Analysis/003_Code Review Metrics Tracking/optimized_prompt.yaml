  discussion_prompt: 'Debate: Is defect detection rate more critical than code coverage for security in code reviews? Use
    OWASP metrics and NIST SP 800-55 examples to argue your position, considering shift-left security in SDLC.'
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains absolute vs. relative metrics with examples (e.g., LOC vs. Defect Density),
    then switches roles and quizzes the partner on formulas and applications.
  problem_solving: Given sample data (500 LOC reviewed in 2 hours, 3 vulnerabilities found, 80% code coverage), compute metrics
    (Defect Density, Inspection Rate, Defect Detection Rate), analyze trends, and suggest process improvements like tool integration
    (e.g., SonarQube).
