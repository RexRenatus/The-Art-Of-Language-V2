active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether regenerating session IDs after authentication is always necessary or
    if there are scenarios where it introduces usability issues. Use OWASP Session Management Cheat Sheet guidelines to support
    your position, addressing security vs. usability trade-offs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (3) Unrelated pitfall (e.g., ''Missing HTTPS'' for cookie Secure flag). Ensure distractors are plausible from voter-noted
    pitfalls or research context.'

  Scaffolding: Generate flashcards progressively across 4 layers: [INSERT scaffolding_layers ARRAY HERE].


  Prerequisites: HTTP statelessness and authentication basics.


  Use Flashcard Schema exactly: [INSERT flashcard_schema OBJECT HERE]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as: {''layer'':
  1-4, ''bloom_level'': ''Remember/etc.'', ''type'': ''cloze/qa/mcq'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''tags'': [''owasp'', ''session-hijacking'']}. Ensure 10-15 cards per layer, high-quality, no duplicates, grounded
  in sources. Vary difficulty within layers.'
