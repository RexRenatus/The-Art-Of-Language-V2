active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue the pros and cons of implementing a Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)
    policy versus a full disclosure policy for a software company. Consider impacts on user safety, researcher incentives,
    and organizational reputation. Support arguments with references to NIST SP 800-216 and CERT/CC guidelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Common misconception (e.g., ''VDP is only for government''); 3) Partial truth (e.g., correct definition but wrong context).
    Ensure distractors are plausible from research context.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on
  ''External Vulnerability Reporting'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Security

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Scaffolding Layers: Cover progressively (10 cards Layer 1, 15 Layer 2, 15 Layer 3, 10 Layer 4) using provided content.

  - Active Learning: Draw questions from discussion/peer/problem-solving for higher Bloom''s.

  - Balance Bloom''s: 20% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 30% APPLY/ANALYZE, 50% EVALUATE/CREATE.

  - 40% MCQ with distractors, 30% short answer, 20% scenario application, 10% creation prompts.


  Use Flashcard Schema exactly:

  {front: ''...'', back: {answer: ''...'', explanation: ''...'', distractors: [''A'', ''B'', ''C'']}, metadata: {bloom_level:
  ''...'', scaffolding_layer: ''...'', tags: [...]}}


  Ensure completeness: Include truncated best practices (triage, SLAs, safe harbor), sources (CERT/CC, NIST SP 800-216). Questions
  promote active recall, spaced repetition. Output as JSON array of 50 flashcards.'
