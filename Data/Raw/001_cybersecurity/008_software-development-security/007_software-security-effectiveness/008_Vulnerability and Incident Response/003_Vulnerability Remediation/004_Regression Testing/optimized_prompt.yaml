active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a small group, debate the trade-offs between full regression testing and selective/risk-based regression
    testing in a resource-constrained DevSecOps environment post-vulnerability patch. Use real-world examples from OWASP or
    NIST scenarios to support arguments, and vote on the best approach for cyber resilience.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    1. Superficially similar (e.g., confuse with ''unit testing'' as initial test).

    2. Partial truth (e.g., ''tests new features only'' ignoring existing).

    3. Extreme/opposite (e.g., ''manual only, no automation''). Ensure distractors tie to cybersecurity context (e.g., ignore
    security regressions). Label correct answer clearly.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom''s Taxonomy-aligned,
  scaffolded learning. Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Regression Testing'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity

  Remediation > Regression Testing). Consensus: 100% voter approval on completeness, pedagogy, scaffolding.


  Core Content (Web-grounded):

  Regression testing re-executes prior tests post-changes to ensure no new defects/security issues (e.g., reintroduced vulns).
  Vital for cyber resilience (withstand attacks post-updates). Integrates in SDLC/DevSecOps (''shift-left''). Standards: NIST
  SP 800-53 Rev5 (SA-11: Developer Testing includes regression to verify fixes; completes truncated: ''principles align with
  secure SDLC practices''), OWASP Testing Guide (https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/), ISTQB Syllabus.
