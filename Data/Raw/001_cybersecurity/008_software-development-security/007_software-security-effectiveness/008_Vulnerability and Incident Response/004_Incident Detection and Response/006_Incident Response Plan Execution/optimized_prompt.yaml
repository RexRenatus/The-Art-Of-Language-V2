active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how inadequate Preparation in the IRP execution phases (per NIST SP 800-61
    Rev. 3) could cascade failures into Detection and Analysis, using real-world examples like the SolarWinds breach. What
    mitigations would you propose?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 1 opposite (e.g., 'Ignore incident' vs. 'Triage').
    - 1 unrelated (e.g., from Preparation phase).
    - Ensure distractors test analysis/evaluation (Bloom's higher levels).
