active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of risk-based prioritization versus vulnerability-only prioritization
    in resource-constrained DevSecOps environments. How does it align with NIST CSF, and what enterprise factors (e.g., business
    impact) should influence decisions? Provide examples from real-world breaches.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    impact (e.g., prioritize high-impact low-likelihood over high-likelihood), 2) Ignore enterprise context (e.g., overlook
    business impact), 3) Mix models (e.g., apply CVSS temporal to DREAD). Ensure distractors are realistic from NIST/common

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom''s Taxonomy, active
  learning, and scaffolding. Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Risk-Based Prioritization'' (Topic Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Security Effectiveness > Vulnerability and Incident Response >
  Vulnerability Assessment and Prioritization > Risk-Based Prioritization).


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Draw questions from discussion prompts, peer activities, and exercises for application cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across Prior Knowledge, Layers 1-4 (Foundation: definitions; Components: CVSS/DREAD/matrix;
  Implementation: steps/scenarios; Integration: SDLC/NIST).

  - Big Picture: Emphasize SDLC/DevSecOps fit, NIST CSF 2.0.

  - Assessments: Include 2-3 MCQs (plausible distractors on misconceptions like likelihood-impact confusion), 1 short answer
  (''Explain risk assessment vs. prioritization''), 1 scenario (prioritize Vulns A/B), with immediate feedback/explanations/remediation
  links (e.g., NIST resources).


  Use exact Flashcard Schema: [INSERT FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''MCQ|Q&A|Cloze|Scenario'',
  ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...''}]. Ensure progression: 40% lower Bloom''s (Remember/Understand), 40% middle (Apply/Analyze),
  20% higher (Evaluate/Create). Cover voter priorities: pedagogy, assessments, feedback. Base on research: NIST CSF, CVSS/DREAD
  definitions.'
