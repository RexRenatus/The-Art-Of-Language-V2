active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains a key pattern (e.g., mutual TLS for service-to-service communication or Istio
    service mesh for policy enforcement), while the partner quizzes them on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Does service isolation
    alone equal security?'). Switch roles and assess understanding via teach-back.
  problem_solving: Given a real-world e-commerce microservices scenario (order service, payment service, inventory service),
    perform threat modeling (STRIDE) and design mitigations using patterns like API Gateway for perimeter defense, mTLS for
    internal comms, and circuit breakers with security checks. Prototype a simple diagram and present solutions.

    - Plausible (e.g., similar terms like ''one-way TLS'' vs ''mutual TLS'').

    - Based on common misconceptions (e.g., ''API Gateway secures all internal comms'' – no, only perimeter).

    - Derived from research (e.g., monolith advantages as distractor for microservices benefits).

    - Varied difficulty (1 superficial, 1 conceptual error, 1 advanced mix-up). Mark correct with **bold** in back.'

  **Full Research Context (Completed/Expanded):** Microservices architecture offers agility/scalability but increases security
  challenges due to distribution. Core Concepts: Microservices (independent API-communicating services); Microservices Security
  (protecting services/comms/system); Attack Surface (expanded entry points); Service-to-Service Communication (vulnerable
  to interception); Layered Security (defense in depth). Challenges: Larger attack surface; Service comms risks (eavesdropping,
  MITM, spoofing); Decentralized data/secrets management; Config sprawl; Dynamic scaling/monitoring complexity. Patterns:
  API Gateway (perimeter auth/rate-limiting); Mutual TLS (mTLS for bidirectional auth); Service Mesh (Istio: auto-mTLS, policies,
  observability); Circuit Breakers (security-integrated failover); Zero Trust (segmentation, continuous verification). NIST
  SP 800-204 (Security Strategies for Microservices): Defines patterns like Autonomous Service Protection, Decentralized Policy
  Decisions, Secure Onboarding, Runtime Protection—focuses on verifiable, resilient controls. Real-world: Netflix (Zuul/Istio),
  AWS (API Gateway/Lambda). Sources: NIST SP 800-204 (nist.gov), OWASP Microservices Top 10, CNCF Istio docs, ''Secure Microservices''
  by O''Reilly.


  **Prerequisites/Links:** Microservices basics, network security (TLS), CIA triad, monolith vs. microservices.


  **Incorporate:**

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the 6 objectives above].

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste the 4 layers above]—distribute flashcards evenly (12-13 per layer).

  - Active Learning: Tie explanations to activities (e.g., ''Use in e-commerce threat modeling'').


  **Generation Rules:** Follow flashcard_schema exactly. Output ONLY a JSON array of 50 objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'':
  ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': 1, ''tags'': [''tag1'', ''tag2'']}, ...]. Ensure coverage: 20% Remember/Understand,
  30% Apply/Analyze, 50% Evaluate/Create. Atomic facts, no overload. University pedagogy: Active recall, misconceptions via
  distractors, Bloom''s progression.'
