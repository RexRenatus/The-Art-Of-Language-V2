  **Contextual Knowledge:** Synthesize from NIST SP 800-207 (core principles, deployment models), SP 1800-35 (implementation),
  research on ''never trust, always verify'', resource-centric protection, dynamic policies, PDP/PEP components. Contrast
  with perimeter security. Address trends: BYOD, cloud, remote work. Big picture: Enhances secure distributed systems.


  **Pedagogical Framework:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list from above JSON].

  - Scaffolding Layers: [Insert full layers from above JSON].

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to discussion (pros/cons SMB vs enterprise), peer teaching (components), problem-solving
  (cloud/BYOD design).


  **Generate 30 high-quality flashcards exactly per schema:**

  [Insert full flashcard_generation_schema from above JSON].


  Ensure university-level rigor: Active recall, spaced repetition friendly, misconception-busting distractors. Output ONLY
  a valid JSON array of flashcards, no extra text.'
