active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a microservices environment, discuss the security trade-offs of implementing strong mTLS encryption
    versus performance overhead. How does this align with zero-trust architecture? Provide pros, cons, and mitigation strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    truths (e.g., ''Kubernetes handles security'' - partial, but mesh adds layer). 3) Irrelevant but plausible (e.g., NIST
    SP 800-53 controls vs. 800-204A mesh-specific). Ensure 60% factual accuracy in distractors to test deep understanding.'

  Core Content (Web Research): Service mesh = infrastructure for secure, observable microservices communication (control plane
  + data plane/sidecar proxies like Envoy). Security: Authentication/authorization, mTLS encryption, policy enforcement, observability.
  NIST SP 800-204A (csrc.nist.gov): Guides proxy deployment, STS, key mgmt, secure discovery.
