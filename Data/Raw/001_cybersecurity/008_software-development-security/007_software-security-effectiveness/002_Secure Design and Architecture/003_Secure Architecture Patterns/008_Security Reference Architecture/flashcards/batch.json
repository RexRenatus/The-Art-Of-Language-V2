      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The SSDF aims to reduce vulnerabilities and mitigate their impact because proactive integration of security practices throughout the SDLC is more effective and efficient than solely relying on post-release patching or reporting. This leads to more secure software from the outset.",
