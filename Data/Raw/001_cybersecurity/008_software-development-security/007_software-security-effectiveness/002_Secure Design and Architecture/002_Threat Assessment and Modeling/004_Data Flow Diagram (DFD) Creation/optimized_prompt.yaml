active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In groups of 3-4, discuss how DFDs differ from familiar concepts like flowcharts or UML activity diagrams,
    and debate their unique value in cybersecurity for modeling threats like data exfiltration in an online banking app. Share
    one misconception clarified.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Topic: Data Flow Diagram (DFD) Creation.\
  \ Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Security Effectiveness > 002_Secure 004_Design and\
  \ Architecture > Threat Assessment and Modeling > DFD Creation.\n\nIncorporate: \n- Learning Objectives (use provided JSON\
  \ list, tag each card with level).\n- Active Learning (inspire cards with discussion/peer/problem-solving scenarios, e.g.,\
  \ banking app).\n- Scaffolding (distribute cards: 6 Layer1, 6 Layer2, 7 Layer3, 6 Layer4).\n- Research: DFDs visualize data\
