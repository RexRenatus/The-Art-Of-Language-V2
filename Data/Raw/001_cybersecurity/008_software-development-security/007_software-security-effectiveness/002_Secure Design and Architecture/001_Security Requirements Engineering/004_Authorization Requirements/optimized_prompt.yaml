active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one explains authorization vs. authentication with diagrams (e.g., flowcharts), then switches;
    teach-back includes drawing an RBAC model and quizzing on misconceptions like assuming all resources need authentication.
  problem_solving: Groups design authorization requirements for an e-commerce app (e.g., user roles for checkout, admin inventory).
    Simulate bypass attacks (e.g., privilege escalation), iterate based on OWASP checks, and present defenses.

    - 'Base on common misconceptions: e.g., confuse authz with authn (''Authorization verifies identity''), assume authn always
      required (''Public pages need login''), ignore deny-by-default (''Allow unless forbidden'').'
    - 'Plausible: Use partial truths (e.g., ''RBAC uses attributes'' for ABAC distractor).'
    - '3 distractors per MCQ: 1 superficially similar, 1 opposite/extreme, 1 outdated/common error.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Software Development Security.
  Topic: Authorization Requirements (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Security Effectiveness
  > 002_Secure 004_Design and Architecture > Security Requirements Engineering > Authorization Requirements). Builds on prior
  authentication knowledge.


  Sources: OWASP Authorization Cheat Sheet (deny-by-default, role-based checks per resource/action, separate from business
  logic, centralized enforcement); NIST SP 800-63-4 (Digital Identity Guidelines); breaches like Capital One, SolarWinds.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert the learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: Inspire cards from discussions (authn not always prereq), peer teaching (diagrams/models), problem-solving
  (e-commerce design).

  - Scaffolding: Generate cards evenly across 4 layers: [insert scaffolding_layers here].


  Output 30 high-quality flashcards in JSON array: [{''type'': ''MCQ|Q/A|Cloze'', ''layer'': 1-4, ''blooms_level'': ''Remember|etc.'',
  ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...''}]. Follow flashcard_schema exactly. Distractors per protocol. Ensure progressive complexity,
  metacognition (e.g., ''Why might you confuse this?''), real-world ties. No duplicates; cover models (RBAC/ABAC/PBAC), principles,
  integration.'
