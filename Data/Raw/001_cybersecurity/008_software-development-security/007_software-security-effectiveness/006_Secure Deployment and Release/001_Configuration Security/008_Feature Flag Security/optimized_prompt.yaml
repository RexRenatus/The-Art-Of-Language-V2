active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Feature flags boost deployment agility but expand the attack surface—debate the top 3 risks (e.g., unauthorized
    flag flips, auditing gaps, sensitive data exposure) and mitigation strategies using NIST SSDF or OWASP references. Which
    risk is hardest to mitigate and why? (Encourages compare/contrast and critical thinking.)
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors from: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Feature flags need no security as they''re
    just config''). 2) Partial truths (e.g., ''Performance issues'' instead of access risks). 3) Confusions with related concepts
    (e.g., code vulns vs. runtime flags). Ensure plausibility for higher Bloom''s levels; 60% MCQs, 20% cloze, 20% scenarios.
    20-30 flashcards total, balanced across scaffolding layers and objectives.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Feature Flag Security (Topic

  active learning, scaffolding, and completeness.


  **Research Context (Completed):** Feature flags decouple deployment from release for canary/A/B testing but introduce risks
  like unauthorized manipulation, data exposure, auditing gaps (OWASP CI/CD Top Risks: e.g., #1 Insufficient Credential Hygiene,
  #3 Insufficient Logging—flags amplify these). Best Practices: 1) RBAC/ABAC for access; 2) Encrypt sensitive flags; 3) Audit
  all changes; 4) Short TTL/lifecycle mgmt; 5) CI/CD validation; 6) Monitoring/alerts. Frameworks: NIST SSDF (PR.6.1-6.3 secure
  deployment prep), OWASP DevSecOps Guideline. Prior Knowledge: CI/CD, canary releases, access control.

  [Insert flashcard_schema.structure here]. Follow distractor protocol strictly. Ensure variety: 15 MCQs, 5 cloze, 5 scenarios.
  Tag each with Bloom''s level, layer, objective #. Make assessable (formative: e.g., MCQs with explanations). Output as JSON
  array of objects, e.g., {''type'': ''MCQ'', ''question'': ''...'', ''correct_answer'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''A'',
