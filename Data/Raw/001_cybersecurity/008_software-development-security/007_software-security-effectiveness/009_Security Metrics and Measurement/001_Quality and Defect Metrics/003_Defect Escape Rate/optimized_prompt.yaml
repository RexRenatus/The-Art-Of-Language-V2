active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate whether prioritizing DER reduction justifies slowing down release cycles. Use NIST SSDF (SP 800-218)
    practices as reference, considering real-world examples like Log4Shell or Heartbleed as escaped defects.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., DER ignores non-security defects).'
    - 'Distractor 2: Calculation error (e.g., wrong formula like total defects only).'
    - 'Distractor 3: Confusable term (e.g., mix-up with defect density or DRE).'
    - Ensure distractors are plausible based on voter-noted misconceptions (e.g., 'DER only for large orgs') and research
      context.
    - 'Vary difficulty: 30% remember/understand, 40% apply/analyze, 30% evaluate/create.'

  Incorporate these exactly:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE]

  - Best Practices: Shift-left security (SAST, DAST, IAST), penetration testing, peer reviews, continuous monitoring, incident
  response integration, CI/CD gates. Target DER <5%. Examples: Log4Shell, Heartbleed.

  - Sources: NIST SP 800-218 SSDF v1.1 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-218), OWASP SAMM, ISO/IEC 27034.

  - Concept Map: Central DER → SDLC phases (pre/post defects) → Factors (testing types) → Outcomes (risk reduction).

  - Formula: DER = (Post-release security defects / Total SDLC security defects) × 100%.
