      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The Precision-Recall tradeoff describes the inverse relationship between precision and recall. When you tune a security tool to be more precise (fewer false positives), it often becomes less sensitive, leading to lower recall (more false negatives). Conversely, increasing recall may increase false positives.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly state that precision and recall improve together, that reducing false positives doesn't affect true positive detection, or that the tradeoff is only for false negatives.",
        "analogy": "It's like trying to catch only the biggest fish with a wide-mesh net (high precision, low recall) versus using a fine-mesh net that catches everything, including tiny fish you don't want (low precision, high recall)."
