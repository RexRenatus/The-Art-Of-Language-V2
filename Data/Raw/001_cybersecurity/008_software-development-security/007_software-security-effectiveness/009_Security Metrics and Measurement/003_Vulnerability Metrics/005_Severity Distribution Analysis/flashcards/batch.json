        "core_logic": "The Scope (S) metric in CVSS v4.0 is significant because it reflects whether a vulnerability's exploit can affect resources managed by a different security authority than the one managing the vulnerable component. If the scope changes (e.g., from a web application to the underlying operating system), the potential impact and thus severity often increases, influencing its position in the distribution.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The first distractor confuses scope with network distribution. The second incorrectly links it to user interaction. The third provides factually incorrect information about its relevance.",
        "analogy": "Imagine a security guard (vulnerable component) who can only control access within their assigned zone. If they are compromised, and this allows an attacker to access adjacent, more critical zones (scope changed), the initial compromise is more severe."
