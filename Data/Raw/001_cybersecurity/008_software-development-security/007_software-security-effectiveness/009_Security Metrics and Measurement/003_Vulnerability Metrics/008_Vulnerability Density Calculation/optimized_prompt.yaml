active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate whether vulnerability density using Lines of Code (LOC) is more effective than function points
    for measuring security in web applications versus embedded systems. Consider common misconceptions, such as ignoring vulnerability
    severity (e.g., CVSS scores) or exploitability, and propose hybrid approaches with real-world examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2. Edge cases (e.g., unweighted vs. CVSS-weighted); 3. Confusable terms (LOC vs. function points); 4. Real-world pitfalls
    (ignoring severity). Ensure 70% plausibility to challenge analysis/evaluation.'

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE]

  - Best Practices: Contextualize density with CVSS severity (e.g., weight formula), exploitability, trends (high density
  >1 vuln/KLOC often poor, but evaluate context); automate scans; compare projects; limitations (e.g., LOC biases complex
  code).

  - Research Context: Vulnerability = exploitable weakness; Density = Vulns / Code Size (LOC, etc.); Standards: CVSS v4.0
  (https://www.first.org/cvss/v4-0/specification-document), NIST SP 800-218 (secure dev), OWASP SAMM (https://owaspsamm.org/),
  ISO 27001 Annex A.14.
