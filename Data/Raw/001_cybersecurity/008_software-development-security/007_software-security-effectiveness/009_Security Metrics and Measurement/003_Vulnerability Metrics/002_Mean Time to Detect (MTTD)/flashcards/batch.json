        "core_logic": "A high MTTD means that security threats remain hidden within the network for extended periods. This extended dwell time allows attackers to achieve their objectives, such as stealing data or disrupting operations, before being discovered, thus severely weakening the security posture.",

        "core_logic": "Integrating security monitoring and alerting into CI/CD pipelines allows for continuous security checks during the development process.
