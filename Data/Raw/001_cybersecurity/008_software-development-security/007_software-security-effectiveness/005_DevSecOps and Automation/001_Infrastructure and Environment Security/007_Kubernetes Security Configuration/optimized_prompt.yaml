active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs of implementing Privileged vs. Restricted Pod Security Standards in a multi-tenant
    production cluster. What are the key risks and benefits for each, and how would you balance security with developer productivity?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Similar terms (e.g., Baseline vs. Restricted). 3) Edge cases/real-world errors (e.g., ''Default'' as overly permissive).
    4) Partial truths from CIS Benchmarks. Ensure one distractor is a frequent misconfig from research (e.g., hostNetwork:
