    endpoints in a remote work environment. Provide real-world examples from recent breaches (e.g., npm supply chain attacks
    or Log4j exploitation on dev machines).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

    (e.g., ''Perimeter security is sufficient for remote devs''), 2) Partial truths (e.g., OWASP only for web apps), 3) Related
    but incorrect concepts (e.g., confuse EDR with antivirus). Ensure distractors teach by contrast.'

  Core Content (from NIST, OWASP, CISA, startupdefense.io, owasp.org, cisa.gov, orientsoftware.com): Endpoint Security protects
  diverse devices (laptops, IDEs, CI/CD servers, IoT) as network entry points. Integrates into SDLC/DevSecOps via Zero Trust
  (NIST SP 800-207), secure coding (OWASP SAMM/ASVS), supply chain protections (CISA #CISA-2022-01), EDR tools (e.g., Defender),
  automation (SBOM, scans). Best practices: Harden dev machines, secure pipelines, monitor remote endpoints. Sources: NIST
  Cybersecurity Framework 2.0; OWASP DevSecOps Guideline; CISA Endpoint Security for Software Supply Chains; OpenSSF Best
  Practices.


  Use this EXACT structure to generate 50 high-quality flashcards (balanced across Bloom''s levels, 12-13 per scaffolding
  layer):

  1. Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM JSON].

  2. Active Learning: Embed prompts as higher-level cards (e.g., ''Debate Zero Trust vs Perimeter...'').

  3. Scaffolding: Distribute cards: Layer 1 (12 cards, foundational recall), Layer 2 (13, frameworks), Layer 3 (13, practices),
  Layer 4 (12, integration).

  4. Prior/Related: Include prereqs (SDLC), links (DevSecOps), concept maps as cloze cards.


  Flashcard Schema: [PASTE FULL SCHEMA FROM JSON]. Ensure coverage: 100% consensus voter priorities (completeness: CISA/full
  sources; pedagogy: Bloom''s/scaffolding; active learning; problem-solving; integrations). Vary difficulty, use active recall.
  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards.'
