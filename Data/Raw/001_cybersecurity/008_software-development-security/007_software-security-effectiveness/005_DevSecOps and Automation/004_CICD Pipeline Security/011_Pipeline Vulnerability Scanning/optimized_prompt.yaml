  ## Pipeline Vulnerability Scanning: Comprehensive Summary

  Pipeline vulnerability scanning identifies/mitigates weaknesses in software delivery pipelines, integral to DevSecOps.


  ### Core Concepts

  - Software Delivery Pipeline: Stages (Plan, Develop, Integrate, Release, Operate).

  - Vulnerability Scanning: Inspect apps/systems for weaknesses.

  - DevSecOps: Security in every DevOps stage.

  - Artifact Integrity: Authentic, untampered components.

  - Operational Resilience: Withstand/recover from incidents.


  ### Scanning Types

  - SAST (static), DAST (dynamic), SCA (dependencies), IAST, Container (Trivy).


  ### Standards/Frameworks

  - **OWASP SPVS**: Maturity tiers 1-4 for pipeline security (code, artifacts, envs). https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-pipeline-verification-standard/

  - **OWASP Top 10 CI/CD Risks**: E.g., tampered artifacts, insufficient auth. https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/CI_CD_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html

  - **NIST SP 800-218 SSDF**: Secure dev practices (PO, PR, PS). https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-218.pdf

  - Tools: Trivy (Aqua), Snyk, SonarQube, Cosign (signing).

  - Case: SolarWinds supply chain attack.
