active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the risks of bypassing deployment authorization controls (e.g., reference
    the SolarWinds supply chain attack). How do these controls build on prior knowledge of CI/CD pipelines and access controls?
    Propose one improvement for a hypothetical pipeline lacking manual approvals.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Use this optimized learning framework:

  - **Learning Objectives**: [Insert full list from above].

  - **Scaffolding Layers**: [Insert full descriptions from above].

  - **Active Learning**: Incorporate ties to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving in explanations.

  - **Big Picture**: Controls prevent unauthorized deploys in Secure SDLC/DevSecOps (e.g., SolarWinds). Prior knowledge: CI/CD
  basics, access controls.
