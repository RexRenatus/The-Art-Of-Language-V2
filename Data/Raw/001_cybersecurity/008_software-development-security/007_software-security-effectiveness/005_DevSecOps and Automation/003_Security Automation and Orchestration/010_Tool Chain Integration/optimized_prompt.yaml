  Topic: Tool Chain Integration (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Security Effectiveness
  > 008_DevSecOps and Automation > Security 015_Automation and Orchestration > Tool Chain Integration). Use this research
  context: Tool chain integration embeds security (SAST/DAST/SCA, SBOM) into SDLC/CI/CD via DevSecOps for SSC security and
  artifact integrity (NIST SP 800-204D: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/204/d/final; CSF 2.0: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.29.pdf).
  Prior knowledge: Basic CI/CD, DevOps, SDLC.


  Learning Objectives: [Insert the learning_objectives array here]. Scaffolding Layers: [Insert scaffolding_layers array here].
  Active Learning: Use for contextual explanations.


  Generate 25 flashcards following this exact schema: [Insert flashcard_generation_schema.structure here]. Ensure accuracy:
  Fix NIST links to csrc.nist.gov. Balance: 30% Layer 1/Remember-Understand, 30% Layer 2-3/Apply-Analyze, 40% Layer 4/Evaluate-Create.
  Include concept map elements (e.g., dependencies). Output as JSON array of objects, each with ''front'', ''back'' (nested
  object), ''metadata''. No extra text.'
