  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of centralized versus decentralized log aggregation: How
    does centralization improve threat detection (e.g., via SIEM correlation), but what scalability and single-point-of-failure
    risks does it introduce? Reference NIST SP 800-92 and real-world examples like a ransomware incident.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Topic: Centralized Log Aggregation (Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Security Effectiveness > 006_Operational Security and Monitoring
  > Security Monitoring and Logging > Centralized Log Aggregation). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning
  activities, 4-layer scaffolding (with content, quizzes, sources), and flashcard schema to generate high-quality, pedagogically
  optimized flashcards.


  Incorporate:

  - Bloom''s progression: Mix REMEMBER (defs), UNDERSTAND/ APPLY (lifecycle/steps), ANALYZE/EVALUATE/CREATE (comparisons/designs).

  - Scaffolding: Tag each card with layer (e.g., #Layer1).

  - Active Learning: 20% of cards reference discussion/activities (e.g., ''Relate to scenario in problem-solving exercise'').

  - Voter Priorities: Ensure completeness (full best practices, sources), pedagogy (assessments, prior links).

  - Distractors: Plausible per protocol.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 30 flashcards, each matching the schema exactly (MCQ: 10, Cloze: 10, Q&A: 10). No extra text.'
