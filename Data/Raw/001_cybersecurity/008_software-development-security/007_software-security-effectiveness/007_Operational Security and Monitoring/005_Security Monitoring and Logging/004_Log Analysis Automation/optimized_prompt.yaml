active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given the principles in NIST SP 800-92, debate whether full automation of log analysis can ever fully
    replace human analysts in detecting sophisticated, zero-day attacks. Use real-world examples like the SolarWinds breach
    to support arguments on automation limits versus human intuition.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains the log management lifecycle (generation, transmission, storage, analysis,
    disposal) to their partner using a flowchart created on the spot; the partner then teaches back the differences between
    SIEM and SOAR. Switch roles and discuss integration challenges.
  problem_solving: Given anonymized log samples from a network intrusion (e.g., suspicious IPs, repeated failed authentications),
    students design and prototype a basic automation script (e.g., Python with Pandas or regex) to parse logs, flag anomalies,
    and generate alerts. Test on sample data and iterate based on peer feedback.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ using: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Automation fully replaces
    humans''); 2) Partial truths (e.g., mix NIST/ACSC guidelines); 3) Real-world edge cases (e.g., zero-day limitations);
    4) Superficially similar terms (e.g., SIEM vs. SOAR). Ensure distractors are plausible for learners at intermediate cybersecurity
    level.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy\
  \ (Bloom's Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 20 high-quality flashcards on 'Log Analysis Automation' (Category:\
  \ Cybersecurity; Domain: Software Development Security; Subdomain: Software Security Effectiveness; Entry: 006_Operational\
  \ Security and Monitoring > Security Monitoring and Logging).\n\n**Context & Sources:**\n- Big Picture: Essential for real-time\
  \ threat response in operational security, reducing MTTD/MTTR.\n- Prior Knowledge: Manual log review, basic SIEM.\n- Related\
  \ Concepts: SIEM, SOAR, NIST SP 800-92 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/92/final), ACSC Logging Guidance (https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cybersecurity/essential-eight/logging-and-monitoring).\n\
  - Misconceptions: Automation eliminates humans; all logs equal importance.\n- Core Concepts: Log data (event records); Log\
  \ management (lifecycle per NIST); Automation via SIEM (collect, parse, correlate, alert).\n\n**Learning Objectives:** [Insert\
  \ the learning_objectives array here as a bulleted list].\n\n**Scaffolding Layers:** Distribute flashcards: 5 Layer 1, 5\
  \ Layer 2, 5 Layer 3, 5 Layer 4. [Insert scaffolding array here].\n\n**Active Learning Ties:** Weave in discussion (automation\
  \ limits, SolarWinds), peer teaching (log lifecycle, SIEM/SOAR), problem-solving (script logs) into explanations.\n\n**Output\
  \ Format:** JSON array of 20 flashcards. Each: {\n  \"front\": \"Question text\",\n  \"type\": \"MCQ|Cloze|Short Answer\"\
  ,\n  \"options\": [\"A. ...\", \"B. ...\", \"C. ...\", \"D. ...\"] (omit for non-MCQ),\n  \"correct_answer\": \"B (full\

  \ distractors wrong\",\n  \"bloom_level\": \"REMEMBER\",\n  \"scaffolding_layer\": 1\n}\n\nPrioritize 70% MCQ with distractors\
  \ per protocol. Ensure web-grounded (cite NIST/ACSC), measurable verbs, progressive difficulty. Vary formats for engagement."
