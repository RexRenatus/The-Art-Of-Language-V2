active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss common misconceptions about container security (e.g., 'Containers are as secure as VMs due to
    isolation') using evidence from NIST SP 800-190 and real-world breaches. Categorize runtime threats by lifecycle phase
    and debate the role of CNAPP in mitigation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Plausible based on misconceptions (e.g., confuse runtime with build-time).
    - Near-misses from research (e.g., cgroups vs. namespaces).
    - Overgeneralizations (e.g., 'CNAPP only for deployment').
    - Outdated views (e.g., ignore SP 800-190 updates).
    - 1-2 distractors per card; ensure 70% learner error rate simulation.
