active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare RASP with WAFs and WAAPs. When would you deploy RASP in a microservices architecture versus a
    monolithic app? Debate false positive rates, performance impacts, and integration complexities. Support arguments with
    real-world examples from tools like Signal Sciences or Imperva RASP.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
