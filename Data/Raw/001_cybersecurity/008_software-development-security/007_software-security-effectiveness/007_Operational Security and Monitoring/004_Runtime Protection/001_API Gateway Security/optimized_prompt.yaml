active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between strict rate limiting (to prevent DDoS) and API performance
    in high-traffic microservices environments. Reference NIST SP 800-228 and provide real-world examples from breaches like
    the 2023 MOVEit API exploit. What mitigation strategies would you prioritize and why?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - 'Opposite/Extreme: e.g., ''No encryption needed for internal APIs''.'
  - 'Outdated/Non-standard: e.g., ''Use TLS 1.0'' vs. 1.3.'
  - Ensure 1-2 per card from voter priorities (e.g., auth misconfigs).
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on
  ''API Gateway Security'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Security Effectiveness
  > 006_Operational Security and Monitoring > Runtime Protection > API Gateway Security). Use the provided Learning Objectives,
  Active Learning components, Scaffolding Layers (Layer 1-4), and Flashcard Schema exactly.


  Prioritize voter consensus: Completeness on Best Practices (OAuth/JWT auth, rate limiting, input validation, TLS/mTLS, logging/monitoring,
  WAF, IAM/least privilege, threat modeling per NIST SP 800-228). Include prior knowledge links (APIs/HTTP/OAuth/microservices).


  Distribute cards: 12 Layer 1 (Remember/Understand), 15 Layer 2-3 (Apply/Analyze), 12 Layer 3-4 (Evaluate/Create), 11 mixed/integration.


  For each card:

  - Tag with Layer and Bloom''s level.

  - Follow schema: MCQ front/back with distractors (per protocol).

  - Explanations: Evidence-based, with active learning hooks.


  Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''correct'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''a'',''b'',''c''], ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''layer'': ''1'', ''blooms'': ''Remember'', ''hook'': ''...''}}, ...]. Ensure variety, no repetition, university-level
  rigor.'
