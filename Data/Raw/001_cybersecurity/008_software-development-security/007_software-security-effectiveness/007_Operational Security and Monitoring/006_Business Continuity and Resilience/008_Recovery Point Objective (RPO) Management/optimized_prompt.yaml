active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether a zero RPO is feasible for high-priority workloads like financial transaction
    systems versus low-priority ones like internal reporting tools. Use the AWS Well-Architected Framework to support your
    position, considering anti-patterns like unrealistic objectives.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - RPO: Max tolerable data loss time post-incident (e.g., 5min for e-commerce via sync replication; 4hr for email backups).\
  \ Differs from RTO (downtime).\n- Key: BIA for impact; workload matrix (AWS); strategies (replication, snapshots); NIST\
  \ SP 1800-11 (ransomware: recover data integrity via tight RPOs); AWS Well-Architected REL13-BP01 (define per workload,\
  \ avoid arbitrary/zero RPO anti-patterns).\n- Examples: Ransomware cases (NIST SP 1800-11); e-commerce $1M/day scenario.\n\
