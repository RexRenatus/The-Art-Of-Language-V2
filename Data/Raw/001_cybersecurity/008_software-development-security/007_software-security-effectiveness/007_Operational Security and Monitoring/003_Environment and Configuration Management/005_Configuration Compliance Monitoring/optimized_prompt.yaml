active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between rigid configuration baselines (per NIST SP 800-128) and agile development
    practices. Provide examples from real-world breaches like the 2019 Capital One incident caused by misconfigurations. Which
    approach wins in high-velocity environments, and why?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Distractors from common misconceptions (e.g., SecCM as ''general CM only'' vs. security-focused; baselines
    as ''static/compliance-only'' vs. reference for monitoring; ignoring agile trade-offs). Base on voter feedback: confuse
    CM with SecCM, overlook NIST controls, mix dev/prod drifts. Ensure plausible (e.g., partial truths) and educational.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on ''Configuration Compliance Monitoring''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Security Effectiveness > 006_Operational Security
  and Monitoring > Environment and Configuration Management > Configuration Compliance Monitoring). Voter consensus: 67.1%
  approval, priorities: completeness (NIST SP 800-53 CM-2/CM-3/CM-6), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression, activities), big picture
  (90% breaches misconfigs per Verizon DBIR, SDLC/zero-trust role).


  Core Content (from research): Configuration compliance monitoring ensures systems/dev environments/CI/CD pipelines adhere
  to security baselines, preventing misconfigs. Key: CM (consistency mgmt), SecCM (security-focused, NIST SP 800-128), Configuration
  Baseline (approved specs reference), Compliance Monitoring (ongoing assessment). NIST SP 800-53: CM-2 (baselines), CM-3
  (change control), CM-6 (settings). Tools: AWS Config, OPA. Risks: Capital One 2019 breach.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list from JSON above].

  - Active Learning: [insert full active_learning from JSON]. Embed prompts/references in explanations.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [insert full scaffolding from JSON]. Tag cards by layer/Bloom.

  - Schema: Strictly follow [insert full flashcard_schema from JSON]. Output JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'',
  ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': 1, ''type'': ''MCQ/Cloze/etc.''}].


  Ensure: Web-grounded (cite NIST links: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/128), misconception-busting distractors, higher-order
  cards (e.g., ''Design plan'' scenarios), formative assessments (MCQs w/feedback). Optimize for spaced repetition: concise
  fronts, rich backs.'
