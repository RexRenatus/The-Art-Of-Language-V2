  discussion_prompt: 'In a team using IAST for a web app, a tool flags a potential SQL injection. Debate: Is this a true positive,
    false positive, or requires further validation? What steps would you take to confirm, and how do IAST advantages over
    SAST/DAST play in? This sparks debate on validation processes and tool comparisons.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., confuse IAST with SAST runtime).

    - Distractor 2: Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ignore context in validation).

    - Distractor 3: Edge case reversal (e.g., treat false positive as true negative).

    Ensure distractors are web-grounded (e.g., from OWASP false positive examples) and promote critical thinking.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom''s Taxonomy, active
  learning, and scaffolding. Topic: IAST Result Validation (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software
  Security Effectiveness > 008_Security Testing and Verification > Interactive 008_006_Application Security Testing (IAST)
  > IAST Result Validation). Use this research context: [Insert full synthesized context: IAST runtime testing with sensors;
  validation verifies accuracy via reproduction/manual review/triage; vs SAST/DAST advantages; OWASP ASVS V8 L1-L3 details;
  SAMM/BSIMM; best practices (workflows, ticketing); sources as above].


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [paste array above].

  - Scaffolding layers: [paste array above] - Distribute flashcards across layers (8 per layer).

  - Active learning: [paste object above] - Tie 20% of cards to these.

  - Voter priorities: Ensure completeness (OWASP ASVS full, steps, best practices); pedagogy (varied Bloom''s).


  Generate 32 flashcards (8 per Bloom level from objectives, covering all layers):

  - Varied formats but adhere to schema: MCQ front/back.

  - 25% basic recall, 25% apply/analyze, 50% evaluate/create.

  - Distractors per protocol.


  Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''correct_answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'':
  1, ''bloom_level'': ''Analyze'', ''active_learning_tie_in'': ''...''}}, ...]

  Ensure university pedagogy: active, measurable, no fluff.'
