active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a DevSecOps environment with tight CI/CD deadlines, debate the trade-offs between comprehensive DAST
    scans (high coverage, slow) and optimized quick scans (fast, targeted). Provide examples from OWASP guidelines and justify
    your preferred approach for an e-commerce app.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Core Content (Research Context):

  Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) identifies vulnerabilities in running web apps via black-box runtime analysis
  simulating attacks (e.g., SQLi, XSS). Optimize for efficiency: scoping, auth configs, crawling, false positives reduction,
  CI/CD integration. Tools: OWASP ZAP (https://www.zaproxy.org/), Burp Suite (https://portswigger.net/burp). Standards: OWASP
  Top 10 (https://owasp.org/Top10/) prioritizes DAST-detectable risks; OWASP WSTG (https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/).

  Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema:

  [Insert flashcard_schema here]


  Ensure coverage: 10 flashcards per scaffolding layer, balanced Bloom''s (e.g., 8 Remember/Understand, 20 Apply/Analyze,
  12 Evaluate/Create). Vary question types (definitional, comparative, scenario-based). Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'':
  ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''tags'': [''Bloom:APPLY'', ''Layer:3'', ''Level:6'']}, ...]. No duplicates; optimize for spaced
  repetition (Anki-friendly).'
