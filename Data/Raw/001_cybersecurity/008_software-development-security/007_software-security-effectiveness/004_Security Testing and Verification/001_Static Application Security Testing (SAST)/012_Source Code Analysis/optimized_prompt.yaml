active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast Static Application Security Testing (SAST) with Dynamic Application Security Testing
    (DAST). In groups, debate which is more effective for identifying vulnerabilities in modern web applications and why,
    citing real-world examples from OWASP Top 10 (e.g., Injection flaws).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    static analysis); (2) Confusable term (e.g., DAST instead of SAST); (3) Partial truth (e.g., ''Only for open-source code'').
    Ensure distractors are realistic, derived from voter-noted misconceptions or OWASP/CWE pitfalls, and teachable moments.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Source Code Analysis (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Security Effectiveness > 008_Security Testing and Verification
  > Static 008_006_Application Security Testing (SAST) > Source Code Analysis). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy
  progression, active learning, scaffolding.


  **Content Context:** Source code analysis inspects source code for vulnerabilities in SDLC. Core concepts: SAST (static),
  tools (SonarQube, Checkmarx, Semgrep, Bandit). Standards: NIST SP 800-218 SSDF (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-218.pdf),
  OWASP ASVS v4.0 (https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/), OWASP Secure Coding Practices
  (https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/), SLSA (https://slsa.dev/), CWE Top 25.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the learning_objectives array here].


  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Incorporate elements from discussion (SAST vs DAST), peer teaching (code explanations), problem-solving
  (vulnerable snippets) into explanations.


  **Scaffolding:** [Insert scaffolding object here]. Prior knowledge assumed.


  **Generate Flashcards:** Create 20-30 JSON flashcards following the exact schema: [Insert flashcard_schema.structure here].
  Strictly adhere to distractor protocol, balance Bloom''s levels, cover layers. Ensure explanations link to objectives/activities/standards.
  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, e.g., [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}}, ...]. No additional text.'
