  - Scaffolding: [Insert full 4 layers from above]

  - Voter Priorities: Emphasize completeness (Level 1/2 details, tools: CIS-CAT, OpenSCAP, Ansible, Nessus, Qualys; CI/CD
  integration), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression, prior links).

  - Research Context: CIS Benchmarks (consensus hardening guidelines), Levels (1: basic/recommended; 2: stringent/desired),
  hardening process, CIS Controls mapping.
