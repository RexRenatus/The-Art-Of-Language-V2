active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast vertical and horizontal privilege escalation using examples from OWASP WSTG and
    MITRE ATT&CK. Which type poses greater risks in web applications vs. operating systems, and why? Support your arguments
    with real-world breach examples like Equifax (horizontal data access) or SolarWinds (vertical supply chain escalation).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs: 1 correct answer; 3 distractors based on: (1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Horizontal
    escalation always requires root access''); (2) Real-world CVEs swapped (e.g., mix vertical/horizontal examples); (3) Partial
    truths (e.g., tools misused); (4) Edge cases (web vs. OS differences). Ensure distractors are plausible to promote active
    recall.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Privilege Escalation Testing
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > Software Security Effectiveness > 008_Security Testing
  and Verification > Penetration Testing and Red Teaming > Privilege Escalation Testing). Use the provided learning_objectives,
  active_learning components, scaffolding_layers, and flashcard_schema to create optimized Anki-compatible flashcards.


  BIG PICTURE CONTEXT: Privilege escalation testing is essential in SDLC to prevent breaches like SolarWinds (vertical) or
  Equifax (horizontal). Builds on auth/authorization basics.


  RESEARCH CONTEXT: Privilege escalation exploits vulns/misconfigs for higher access. Vertical: low-to-high privs (e.g., user->admin,
  MITRE TA0004 techniques like token theft). Horizontal: peer access (e.g., User A views User B data). OWASP WSTG-ATHZ-03:
  Test via parameter manip, forced browsing, session hijacking. Tools: Burp Suite (intercept/modify), ZAP (scans). CVEs: BlueKeep
  (CVE-2019-0708 vertical OS), PrintNightmare (CVE-2021-34527). MITRE ATT&CK TA0004 covers evasion of controls.


  Incorporate voter priorities: Progressive Bloom''s coverage, discussion sparking critical thinking, hands-on (DVWA/Metasploitable),
  real-world examples/misconceptions for distractors.


  Generate flashcards strictly following the flashcard_schema: Balance layers/Bloom''s, specified formats, distractors, explanations
  with tags. Output as a markdown list or JSON array for easy import. Ensure active learning integration (e.g., reference
  discussion/problem-solving). No external additions; stay educational and ethical (authorized pentesting only).'
