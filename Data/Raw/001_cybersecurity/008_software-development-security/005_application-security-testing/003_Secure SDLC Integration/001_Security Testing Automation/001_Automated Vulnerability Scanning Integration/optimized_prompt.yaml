active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of shift-left security (early automated scanning) versus
    shift-right (post-deployment monitoring) in DevSecOps. Consider factors like developer productivity, false positives,
    and coverage of runtime vulnerabilities. Support arguments with references to OWASP DevSecOps Guidelines or CIS Control
    3.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Automated Vulnerability
  Scanning Integration'' (Category: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > 008_006_Application Security Testing >
  013_Secure SDLC Integration > Security Testing Automation > Level 6). Consensus: 82.9% approval from 7 voters emphasizing
  completeness (OWASP DevSecOps incl. full IAST: runtime instrumentation for precise flaws; SCA: dependency scanning), pedagogy
  (Bloom''s progression), scaffolding, prior knowledge links (Secure SDLC basics), big picture (shift-left DevSecOps, MTTR
  reduction), concept map (SAST/DAST/IAST/SCA → SDLC/standards), tools (SonarQube, ZAP, Snyk), CI/CD examples.


  Research context: Vulnerability scanning defs from OWASP; CVM/CIS Control 3 (automated/authenticated scans); NIST (Identify:
  Vulnerability Mgmt); DevSecOps integration.
