active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges of false positives in automated tools like Snyk or SonarQube
    within CI/CD pipelines and propose strategies for mitigation, referencing shift-left security principles from NIST SSDF.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Similar/confusable term (e.g., SAST vs. DAST), 3) Edge case or partial truth (e.g., ''only for deployment stage'').
    Ensure plausibility based on real-world errors from tools like SonarQube false positives.'

  (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > 008_006_Application Security Testing > 013_Secure SDLC Integration
  > Continuous Integration Security > Automated Security Testing Integration).


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ''learning_objectives'']

  - Active Learning: Use prompts for reflective explanations (e.g., ''Relates to discussion on false positives'').

  - Scaffolding: Generate 10-15 flashcards total, balanced across 4 layers: [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING CONTENT].

  - Prior Knowledge: Reference SDLC/CI/CD basics.

  - Research Context: Automated testing tools (SAST: SonarQube; DAST: OWASP ZAP; SCA: Snyk/Dependabot); Frameworks (OWASP
  WSTG for testing guide; NIST SSDF for secure dev); CI/CD examples (GitHub Actions, Jenkins); Shift-left security.


  Generate 15 high-quality flashcards (5 MCQ, 5 cloze, 5 basic) optimized for Anki/Quizlet. Strictly follow ''flashcard_schema''
  format. Vary difficulty by Bloom''s levels. Output as JSON array of objects, each matching a schema type. Ensure active
  recall, spaced repetition best practices, and distractors per protocol.'
