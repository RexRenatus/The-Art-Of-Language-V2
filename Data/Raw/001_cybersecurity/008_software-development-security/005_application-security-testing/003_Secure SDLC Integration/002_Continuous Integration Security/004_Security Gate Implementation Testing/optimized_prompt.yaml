active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a fast-paced DevOps environment, should security gates be mandatory blockers or advisory warnings?
    Debate using examples from NIST SP 800-115 and real breaches like SolarWinds, considering trade-offs in speed vs. security.
    Address misconceptions that gates always slow development.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Partial truth (e.g., tool name but wrong context); 3) Plausible alternative (e.g., similar NIST pub like 800-53 vs. 800-115).
    Ensure plausibility from research context; avoid randomness.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for university-level cybersecurity education on ''Security Gate Implementation
  Testing'' (Category: Cybersecurity, Domain: Software Development Security, Subdomain: 008_006_Application Security Testing,
  Entry Domain: 013_Secure SDLC Integration, Entry Subdomain: Continuous Integration Security). Topic Hierarchy: Level 1 Cybersecurity

  > Level 5 Continuous Integration Security > Level 6 Security Gate Implementation Testing.


  Core Research Context: Security gates are SDLC checkpoints (e.g., scans, reviews) verified via implementation testing. Key
  frameworks: NIST SP 800-115 (Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment by Scarfone et al., practical
  recommendations for testing); NIST SP 800-53A (full assessment of security/privacy controls, step-by-step validation beyond
  implementation). Tools: SonarQube, OWASP ZAP, Dependabot. Concepts: Vulnerability/risk management, SAST/DAST, CI/CD integration,
  false positives/negatives.


  Use Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives: [insert learning_objectives array]. Incorporate active learning: [insert active_learning
  object]. Scaffolding: Progressive 4 layers [insert scaffolding array].


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards (10 MCQ, 10 Q&A, 10 Cloze) spanning all Bloom''s levels and scaffolding layers (7-8
  per layer). Ensure 100% coverage of voter priorities (e.g., NIST completion, tools, trade-offs). Prioritize active recall,
  spaced repetition best practices.


  Output strictly as JSON array: [{''type'': ''MCQ|Q&A|Cloze'', ''bloom_level'': ''REMEMBER|etc.'', ''scaffolding_layer'':
  1-4, ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''A'', ''B'', ''C'']
  if MCQ, ''source'': ''...''} }]. No extra text.'
