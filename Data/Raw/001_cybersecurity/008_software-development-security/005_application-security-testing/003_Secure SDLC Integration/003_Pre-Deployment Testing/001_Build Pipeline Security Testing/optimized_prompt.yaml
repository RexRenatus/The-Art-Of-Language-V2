  Research Context (Complete OWASP DevSecOps Guideline: Integrates security via shift-left, automated gates; OWASP SPVS: 50+
  controls for pipeline maturity (e.g., V1: Code Integrity, V2: Artifact Protection); Top 10 CI/CD Risks: 1. Credential Misuse,
  2. Insufficient LBAC, 3. Dependency Confusion, 4. Malicious Pipeline Execution, 5. etc. [full list inspired by OWASP/SLSA];
  Tests: SAST (static code), SCA (open-source vulns), IAST, secret scanning, container (Docker Scout), signing (Sigstore).
  Tools: SonarQube, Snyk, Trivy, Cosign. Cases: Codecov (2021 bash script hack), XZ Utils backdoor. Sources: owasp.org/www-project-spvs/,

  Prior Knowledge: CI/CD basics, Secure SDLC.
