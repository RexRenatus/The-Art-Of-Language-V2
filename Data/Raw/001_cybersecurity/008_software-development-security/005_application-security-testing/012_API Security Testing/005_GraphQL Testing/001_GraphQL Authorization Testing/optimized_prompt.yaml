  Research Context (Expanded/Completed per OWASP WSTG v4.2 & GraphQL Cheat Sheet): Authorization determines post-authN access
  in GraphQL. Key risks: BOLA (IDOR via object IDs), field-level bypasses (over-fetching), introspection leaks (__schema exposure).
  Enforce via context in resolvers/business logic. Testing: Authenticate, query unauthorized fields/objects, disable introspection
  prod. Tools: GraphiQL, Postman, InQL (Burp), GraphQL Voyager. Best Practices: @auth directives, RBAC/ABAC, complexity limits.
  Sources: OWASP WSTG-APIV3-03 (GraphQL Testing), OWASP GraphQL Cheat Sheet (2023), graphql.org/learn/security/, PortSwigger
  InQL docs.
