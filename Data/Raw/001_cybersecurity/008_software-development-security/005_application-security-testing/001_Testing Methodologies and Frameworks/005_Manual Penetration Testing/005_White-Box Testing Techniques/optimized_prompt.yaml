  **Core Content (Web-Grounded Research + Completions):** White-box testing (glass-box/structural) examines internal code,
  logic, paths for vulnerabilities. Key concepts: code paths, conditions, loops. Steps: 1. Understand code. 2. Identify paths.
  3. Design cases. 4. Execute/analyze. Coverage: statement/branch/path/condition/data flow. Prior: Builds on black-box. Standards:
  OWASP Testing Guide (code review), NIST SP 800-115 (security testing), CWE/SANS Top 25. Tools: SonarQube. Big Picture: Early
  SDLC vuln detection (e.g., Heartbleed paths). Vulns: buffer overflow, injection.


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list from above].

  - Active Learning: Incorporate prompts/examples into flashcards (e.g., ''Debate scenario: Why precede black-box?'').

  - Scaffolding: Distribute across 4 layers [Insert summaries].


  **Generate 40 flashcards using schema:**

  - 40% Q&A, 40% MCQ, 20% Cloze.

  - Balance: 20% per Bloom''s pair (Remember/Understand, Apply/Analyze, Evaluate/Create); 25% per layer.

  - Distractors: Follow protocol strictly.

  - Each card: Tag with Bloom''s level, layer, objective #, active element if applicable.

  - Output JSON array: [{''type'': ''MCQ|Q&A|Cloze'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''distractors'': [...], ''tags'': [''Remember'', ''Layer1''], ''source'': ''OWASP''}}].


  Ensure high-quality: Precise, educational, misconception-busting, real-world tied.'
