active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the cybersecurity risks of untracked OSS components in the software supply
    chain (e.g., Log4Shell vulnerability). How does SBOM generation address these, and what challenges arise in compliance
    with Executive Order 14028? Support with real-world examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Software Development Security.
  Generate 30 high-quality, spaced-repetition-optimized flashcards on ''Open Source Component Identification'' (Topic Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > 008_006_Application Security Testing > 001_Testing Methodologies and Frameworks
  > 003_Software Composition Analysis (SCA) > Open Source Component Identification). Consensus: 100% voter approval on pedagogy/completeness.


  **Research Context:** Increasing OSS reliance introduces supply chain risks. OSS: inspectable source code (OWASP). SCA:
  third-party risk analysis. SBOM: component inventory (CISA/NTIA). EO 14028 (May 12, 2021): Mandates SBOMs for federal suppliers
  to improve transparency (full: Section 4(e) - ''RECOMMENDED PRACTICES FOR'' securing supply chain via SBOM sharing). Tools:
  OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, Syft. Formats: SPDX, CycloneDX. Sources: OWASP.org/Component_Analysis, CISA.gov/SBOM, NTIA.gov/SBOM-minimum-elements,
  EO14028 whitehouse.gov.


  **Concept Map:** OSS → SCA (entry subdomain) → Component Identification → SBOM Generation → Integration (CI/CD/Vuln Mgmt).


  **Incorporate:** Learning objectives [paste array above], active learning for context, 4-layer scaffolding [paste array
  above]. Ensure coverage: 1-2 cards per objective, progressive difficulty (Layer 1-4).


  **Output Format:** JSON array of 30 objects, each matching flashcard_schema [paste schema above]. Cards must be atomic,
  use active recall, include explanations tying to Bloom''s/real-world (e.g., Log4Shell). Vary types, perfect distractors.'
