  Topic: ''Cross-Site Script Inclusion Testing'' (XSSI/JSONP hijacking). Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security
  > 008_006_Application Security Testing > 013_Client-Side Testing > Cross-Origin Communication > Cross-Site Script Inclusion
  Testing.


  Core Content (from research/OWASP/PortSwigger): XSSI tricks browsers into including JS from trusted domains, bypassing SOP
  via JSONP callbacks. Key: SOP, JSONP, callbacks, sources/sinks. Testing: Burp Suite for callback manipulation. Mitigations:
  CORS, padding (''while(1);''), validate callbacks. Standards: OWASP Testing Guide v4, CWE-830, NIST SP 800-95.


  Learning Objectives (Bloom''s): [Insert the learning_objectives array here].

  Active Learning Context: Use for realistic scenarios [Insert active_learning_components summaries].

  Scaffolding: Generate cards progressively across 4 layers [Insert scaffolding_layers here].


  Generate flashcards per schema: [Insert flashcard_generation_schema here]. Ensure coverage: prerequisites linked, distractors
  thoughtful, explanations tie to testing/protection/standards. Output ONLY a JSON array of 60-80 flashcards, valid JSON,
  no extra text.'
