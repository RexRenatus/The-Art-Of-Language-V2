active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: Students pair up; one explains WebSocket handshake security (e.g., Sec-WebSocket-Key validation, origin checks),
    partner teaches back with a hand-drawn diagram. Switch roles and quiz each other on failure scenarios.
  problem_solving: Provide sample vulnerable WebSocket code (e.g., Node.js chat app without wss:// or input validation). Students
    use Burp Suite/browser dev tools to identify/exploit issues (CSWSH, DoS flooding, injection), propose fixes, and simulate
    a secure deployment in groups.

    - 'Plausible misconceptions (e.g., for CSWSH: ''Same as CSRF but over HTTPS'' vs. correct ''Exploits cross-origin WebSocket
      opens'').'
    - Common errors from research (e.g., 'WebSockets use HTTP/2' as distractor).
    - Edge cases/variations (e.g., 'Origin checks prevent all DoS' – no, only hijacking).
    - 'Balanced difficulty: 1 easy (superficial), 1 medium (partial truth), 1 hard (subtle trap).'
    quantity: Always 3 distractors per MCQ.
    coverage: Distribute across Bloom's levels and scaffolding layers.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in WebSocket Security Testing
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > 008_006_Application Security Testing > 013_Client-Side
  Testing > Cross-Origin Communication > WebSocket Security Testing). Generate high-quality flashcards using university pedagogy:
  Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY], active learning activities [INSERT active_learning OBJECT],
  and 4-layer scaffolding [INSERT scaffolding ARRAY].


  Incorporate research context: WebSocket (RFC 6455: full-duplex persistent over HTTP handshake); vulnerabilities (complete
  CSWSH: attacker forges cross-origin WS connection via lax validation, unlike CSRF''s POST; add DoS flooding, message injection,
  no input validation); tools (Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP for interception); best practices (wss://, origin/token auth, rate-limiting).
  Prerequisites: HTTP/TLS/CORS. Voter consensus: Full coverage of threats/mitigations, pedagogy emphasis.


  Use exact flashcard_schema [INSERT flashcard_schema OBJECT]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"id":1, "bloom_level":"Remember",
  "scaffolding_layer":1, "front":{"question":"...","options":["A)...","B)...","C)...","D)..."]}, "back":{"answer":"B", "explanation":"...","hints":[...],"reference":"..."}}.
  Ensure distractors follow protocol. Cover all objectives/activities/layers comprehensively, with 50-100 cards balanced by
  Bloom''s (higher for upper levels).'
