active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'Analyze a real-world case where faulty total calculations led to financial loss or security breach (e.g.,
    airline ticket pricing errors exploited by attackers). Debate detection methods (e.g., fuzzing boundaries) versus prevention
    strategies (e.g., safe integer libraries). Consider: What role does data integrity play, and how could NIST SP 800-53
    controls mitigate this?'
  peer_teaching: In pairs, Student A explains integer overflow/underflow with a simple code demo (e.g., uint16_t total = qty
    * price exceeding 65535), including exploitation risks. Student B teaches back floating-point precision issues (e.g.,
    0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3 in payment totals). Switch roles and discuss fixes.
  problem_solving: 'Given sample e-commerce code with bugs (e.g., unchecked quantity input leading to negative totals), students
    debug, apply tests (boundary, fuzz), verify fixes, and document results. Extension: Role-play as an attacker exploiting
    the flaw and defender integrating tests into CI/CD.'

    incorrect alternative (e.g., wrong data type). 3) Partial truth (e.g., ''Only affects large quantities''). Ensure 70%
    MCQs with 3 distractors; balance coverage across objectives/layers.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for the topic: **Quantity
  and Total Calculation Testing** (Category: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > 008_006_Application Security
  Testing > 012_Business Logic Testing > Transaction and Payment Logic > Quantity and Total Calculation Testing).


  **Learning Objectives (span all Bloom''s levels)**: [Insert the full ''learning_objectives'' array here].


  **Active Learning Inspiration**: Use elements like discussion on real breaches, peer teaching of vulns, problem-solving
  code debug to inform engaging Qs.


  **Scaffolding Content (cover all layers progressively)**: [Insert the full ''scaffolding'' object here].


  **Output exactly a JSON array of 25 flashcards**, each matching this schema: [Insert the full ''flashcard_schema.structure''
  here]. Follow distractor protocol strictly. Ensure variety: 70% MCQ, 20% short answer (with model response), 10% code analysis.
  Balance: 5 easy (REM/UND), 10 medium (APP/ANA), 10 hard (EVA/CRE). Tags must reference layers/objectives/sources. Make explanations
  educational, tying to real-world (e.g., exploited pricing bugs) and standards (OWASP/NIST). No duplicates; optimize for
  spaced repetition.'
