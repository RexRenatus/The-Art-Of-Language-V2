active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the risks of bypassing certificate validation in mobile apps for user convenience—debate pros/cons
    with real-world examples like banking apps. Address the misconception that HTTPS is inherently secure without proper implementation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: Generate 3 plausible distractors per card based on common misconceptions (e.g., 'HTTPS alone ensures
    security' for MITM risks; outdated TLS versions like 1.0; confusing pinning with basic validation). Draw from real vulns
    (e.g., Heartbleed, POODLE) and voter-noted errors. Ensure distractors are 70% correct-sounding but fail on specifics.
