active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue for or against using ECB mode in a scenario where plaintext blocks are highly
    randomized (e.g., encrypted backups). Use visual examples like ECB-failed penguin image encryption to spark critical thinking
    on diffusion, known-plaintext attacks, and why ECB fails even with randomization.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    errors: e.g., ''ECB provides diffusion'' (no); ''CBC IV can be zero/reused'' (risky); ''CTR uses chaining'' (no, counter);
    ''GCM only for confidentiality'' (AEAD). Ensure distractors teach via explanation.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university-style pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Topic: ''Block Cipher Mode Testing'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software
  Development Security > 008_006_Application Security Testing > 011_001_Cryptography Testing > Encryption Implementation >
  Block Cipher Mode Testing). Ensure completeness: Cover NIST SP 800-38A (ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, CTR), SP 800-38D (GCM AEAD),
  SP 800-38E (XTS-AES), testing (CAVP vectors, KATs, fuzzing, errors like IV reuse, ECB leakage, padding oracles).


  Learning Objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]

  Active Learning: [INSERT active_learning OBJECT HERE] – Weave in references (e.g., ''Relates to peer teaching on CBC'').

  Scaffolding: [INSERT scaffolding ARRAY HERE] – Distribute flashcards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4.


  Generate exactly 40 flashcards following the schema:

  [INSERT flashcard_schema HERE]


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''hints'': [...], ''tags'': [...]}, ''layer'': 1, ''bloom_level'': ''Remember''}, ...]. Prioritize high-fidelity to NIST,
  real-world testing, voter pedagogy (debates, Python exercises). Vary formats: 10 cloze/basic, 15 MCQ (w/ distractors), 10
  apply (pseudocode), 5 evaluate/create. No duplicates; ensure spaced repetition optimization (core facts repeated subtly).'
