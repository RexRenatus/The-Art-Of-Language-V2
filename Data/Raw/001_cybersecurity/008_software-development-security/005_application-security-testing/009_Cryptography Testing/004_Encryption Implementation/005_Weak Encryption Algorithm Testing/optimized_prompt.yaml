active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using legacy weak algorithms like RC4 in legacy systems
    versus migrating to modern ones like AES-256-GCM. Consider factors like performance, compatibility, and security risks,
    referencing OWASP WSTG-CRYP-04 and NIST SP 800-57.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Testing'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > 008_006_Application Security Testing > 011_001_Cryptography
  Testing > Encryption Implementation > Weak Encryption Algorithm Testing).


  Generate 40 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema. Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full list above]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste full list above]

  - Active Learning: Inspire cards that prep for discussions/labs (e.g., ''Scenario: ECB in image → penguin attack?'')

  - Concept Map: Ensure coverage of central node + branches.

  - Sources: OWASP WSTG-CRYP-04 (https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/stable/4.2/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/11-Client_Side_Testing/05-Testing_for_Weak_Cryptography),
  NIST SP 800-57/132.

  - Prior Knowledge: Assume basics; scaffold up.

  - Completeness: Weak algos (DES/3DES/RC4/MD5/SHA-1), keys (DH≥2048-bit, PBKDF2≥310k iters), IV/mode/padding.
