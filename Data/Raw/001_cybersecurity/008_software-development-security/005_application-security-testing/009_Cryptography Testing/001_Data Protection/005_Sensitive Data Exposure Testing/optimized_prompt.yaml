active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the real-world impacts of Sensitive Data Exposure in recent incidents (e.g.,
    Equifax breach). Argue whether inadequate testing or poor encryption was the primary cause, using OWASP guidelines and
    regulatory requirements (GDPR, CCPA) to support your position. Synthesize group consensus on prevention strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    SDE with breaches; mix up TLS versions; overlook HSTS). Each distractor must have ''text'' (incorrect option) and ''explanation''
    (1-2 sentences why wrong, referencing correct concept). Ensure variety: one conceptual mix-up, one tool misuse, one regulatory
    error.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Sensitive Data Exposure
  Testing (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > 008_006_Application Security Testing > 011_001_Cryptography
  Testing > Data Protection > Sensitive Data Exposure Testing).


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list from ''learning_objectives'']

  - Active Learning: Use concepts from discussions, peer teaching, and problem-solving to inspire scenario-based cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers [insert full scaffolding details]. Tag each with ''layer''.

  - Prior Knowledge: Assume basics from cryptography (encryption, hashing, keys) and data classification.

  - Content Completeness: Include OWASP Top Ten (A3:2017), regulations (GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA, CCPA: CA privacy rights/opt-out),
  tools (Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, testssl.sh), techniques (TLS checks, HSTS, MITM), sources (OWASP.org, NIST).


  Output exactly 40 flashcards as a JSON array of objects matching this schema: [insert full ''flashcard_schema'' structure].

  Ensure high pedagogy: Progress Bloom''s Taxonomy [tag each with ''bloom_level'']. Distractors exactly 3 per card, plausible/common
  misconceptions. Explanations reference layers/objectives/tools. No duplicates; cover testing emphasis (implementation heavy).'
