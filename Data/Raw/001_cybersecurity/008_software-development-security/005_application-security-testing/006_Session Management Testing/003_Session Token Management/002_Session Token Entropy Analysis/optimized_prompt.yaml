active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given OWASP guidelines (e.g., WSTG-SESS-01), debate whether a 128-bit session token generated with cryptographically
    secure randomness (CSPRNG) is sufficient for all web applications, or if context-specific factors like user data sensitivity
    and attack surface require higher entropy (e.g., 256 bits). Support arguments with examples from real-world breaches such
    as the 2014 eBay session hijacking incident or Heartbleed-related token exposures.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    long but predictable), (2) Ignore CSPRNG (suggest weak RNG), (3) Misapply standards (e.g., 64-bit as ''sufficient''),
    (4) Real-world pitfalls (timestamp/sequential). Ensure plausible for cybersecurity learners.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the array above].

  - Active Learning: [paste discussion, peer, problem-solving above].

  - Scaffolding: 4 layers [paste scaffolding above].

  - Research: Entropy measures randomness; OWASP WSTG-SESS-01 requires 128+ bits, CSPRNG; Tools: ent, dieharder; Risks: Brute-force
  (time = 2^entropy / guesses/sec), hijacking.


  Voter Consensus (70% approval): Emphasize Bloom''s progression, OWASP completeness, peer/problem-solving, prior links.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcards (mix 40% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 30% APPLY/ANALYZE, 30% EVALUATE/CREATE; 60% MCQ,
  40% short_answer). Strictly follow schema: [paste flashcard_schema structure]. Ensure coverage: 6-8 per scaffolding layer,
  integrate concept map/elements, distractors per protocol. Make engaging, precise, measurable for assessment.'
