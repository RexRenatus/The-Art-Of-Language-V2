active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate whether applications should allow unlimited concurrent sessions for user convenience or enforce
    strict limits, citing OWASP WSTG-SESS-11 guidelines and real-world examples (e.g., banking apps with strict limits vs.
    e-commerce with flexibility). Discuss security risks like account takeover and mitigation strategies such as notifications
    for new sessions from different IPs/devices.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs, create 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions: (1) Partial truths (e.g.,
    correct mechanism but wrong OWASP code); (2) Outdated practices (e.g., no notifications); (3) Confusions with related
    concepts (e.g., mix CSRF with session fixation). Ensure distractors are realistic from voter consensus and OWASP errors.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on the topic ''Concurrent 007_005_Session
  Management Testing'' (Category: Cybersecurity, Domain: Software Development Security, Subdomain: 008_006_Application Security
  Testing, Entry: 007_005_Session Management Testing, Focus: Session Lifecycle, Level 6: Concurrent Testing). Voter consensus:
  82.9% approval (7 voters) prioritizes completeness (finish OWASP best practices: e.g., ''Users should be notified if a new
  session is established from a different device or IP, with testing via multi-login checks''), pedagogy (Bloom''s, 4-layer
  scaffolding), active learning, big picture (AppSec testing for compliance like GDPR/PCI-DSS, prevents account takeovers).


  Incorporate research: OWASP WSTG-SESS-11 for concurrent sessions (test multi-device logins, invalidation, notifications).
  Key concepts: Session management, concurrent sessions (multiple active per user), hijacking/fixation/CSRF risks. Best practices:
  Enforce limits, invalidate old sessions on new login, notify users.


  Use these EXACT learning objectives: [insert array from learning_objectives above]. Cover evenly across Bloom''s.


  Embed active learning: Inspire cards from discussion (debate limits), peer teaching (OWASP steps), problem-solving (mock
  app tests with ZAP/Selenium).


  Scaffold content across 4 layers: [insert scaffolding array above]. Distribute ~12-13 cards per layer.


  Follow flashcard schema EXACTLY: [insert flashcard_schema above]. Output ONLY the JSON array of 50 flashcards. Ensure completeness:
  Link to prerequisites (HTTP cookies, auth), sources (https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/). Big picture:
  Critical for robust session controls in web apps.'
