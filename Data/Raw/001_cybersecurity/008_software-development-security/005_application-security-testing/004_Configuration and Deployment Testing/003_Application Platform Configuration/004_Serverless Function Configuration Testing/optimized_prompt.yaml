active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between serverless scalability benefits and configuration
    security risks (e.g., IAM over-privileging vs. operational efficiency). Cite real-world breaches like the 2021 Capital
    One AWS incident and propose mitigation strategies using OWASP guidelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema. Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Scaffolding layers: [insert full layers above]

  - Active learning: Tie explanations to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving where relevant.

  - Research context: OWASP Serverless FaaS Cheat Sheet, NIST SP 800-53/CM-6/AC-6, AWS Well-Architected, key risks (IAM over-privileging,
  event injection).

  Ensure flashcards progress from Layer 1 (foundation) to Layer 4 (integration), span Bloom''s levels, use precise action
  verbs, and include hyperlinks in explanations. Distractors must educate on misconceptions.'
