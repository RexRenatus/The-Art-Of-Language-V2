active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given the shared kernel in containers, debate whether investing heavily in container security (e.g.,
    image scanning, RBAC) is sufficient or if host OS hardening should take precedence in a Kubernetes cluster. Reference
    NIST SP 800-190 and Kubernetes security checklists to support arguments on isolation myths vs. real threats.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    1. Common misconception (e.g., ''Containers provide full VM isolation'' vs. shared kernel).

    2. Partial truth/outdated practice (e.g., ''Run as root for simplicity'' vs. non-root).

    3. Confused concept (e.g., mix RBAC with network policies). Ensure plausible for experts, derived from real pitfalls in
    sources like Kubernetes checklists.'
