By disabling unnecessary methods, you eliminate functionalities that could be exploited for unauthorized actions, information disclosure, or denial-of-service, thereby enhancing overall security.",

        "core_logic": "The PATCH method, defined in RFC 5789 and referenced in RFC 9110, is specifically designed to apply partial modifications to a resource. Unlike PUT, which replaces the entire resource, PATCH allows for incremental updates, sending only the changes needed. This efficiency is crucial for large resources or when only minor alterations are required.",
