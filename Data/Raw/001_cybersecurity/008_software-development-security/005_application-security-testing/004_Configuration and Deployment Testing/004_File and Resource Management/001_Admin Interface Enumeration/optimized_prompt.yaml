active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains the steps of OWASP WSTG-CONF-05 (e.g., directory enumeration, source code
    review) to the other using a shared demo of a vulnerable app like OWASP Juice Shop; switch roles and verify understanding
    with Q&A.
  problem_solving: Access OWASP Juice Shop (juice-shop.herokuapp.com or local instance); enumerate admin interfaces using
    Gobuster with a wordlist of common paths, document findings (e.g., accessible /administration), propose mitigations (e.g.,
    IP whitelisting), and present in a group report.

  distractor_protocol: '3 distractors per MCQ, plausible based on misconceptions: 1) Confuse enumeration with brute-force
    logins (e.g., ''Trying passwords on /login''); 2) Ignore source code review (e.g., ''Only black-box needed''); 3) Assume
    defaults are secure (e.g., ''/admin always protected''); 4) Mix with unrelated tests (e.g., SQLi); Ensure 1 correct, others
    semantically close.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Admin Interface Enumeration
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Software Development Security > 008_006_Application Security Testing > 003_Configuration
  and Deployment Testing > File and Resource Management > Admin Interface Enumeration). Generate high-quality, spaced-repetition-optimized
  flashcards using university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (via provided objectives), active learning (discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving
  on OWASP Juice Shop), 4-layer scaffolding (Foundation: terms/prereqs; Components: OWASP WSTG-CONF-05/techniques; Implementation:
  black/white-box steps/tools like Gobuster/Burp; Integration: automation/links), and voter-prioritized completeness (e.g.,
  full source code review: grep for paths/comments/configs).


  Learning Objectives: [INSERT ARRAY FROM ABOVE]. Active Learning: Incorporate prompts/examples in explanations (e.g., ''Debate
  /admin risks''). Scaffolding: Distribute cards across layers (Layer 1: 30%, Layer 2: 25%, etc.). Prior Knowledge: Assume
  basic web enum/HTTP; reference as prereq.


  Use exact Flashcard Schema: JSON array of 25 flashcards. Ensure: Action verbs for active recall; Distractors from misconceptions;
  Explanations with OWASP refs, tools (Gobuster, Dirbuster, SecLists), real-world (Juice Shop); Big Picture: Prevents escalation
  per OWASP Guide. Vary difficulty progressively. Output ONLY the JSON array.'
