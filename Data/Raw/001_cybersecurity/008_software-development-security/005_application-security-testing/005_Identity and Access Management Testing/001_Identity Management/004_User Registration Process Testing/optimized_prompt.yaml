active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between user convenience (e.g., frictionless email sign-up) and security (e.g.,
    multi-step identity proofing with biometrics) in registration processes. Use NIST assurance levels and real-world examples
    like bot attacks from missing CAPTCHA to support arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Use this optimized pedagogy:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: Inspire cards from [discussion_prompt, peer_teaching_activity, problem_solving_exercise]

  - Scaffolding: Structure content across 4 layers: [insert full scaffolding array here]


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards following this schema exactly: [insert full flashcard_schema here].


  Incorporate voter consensus: Full NIST SP 800-63-4/OWASP WSTG-IDNT-02 coverage, completed best practices (vetting: self-asserted/remote/supervised;
  tests: input validation, rate limiting, duplicates, CAPTCHA, passwords). Use examples (vuln: no CAPTCHA=bots; secure: IAL-matched
  proofing). Ensure progression: 30% remember/understand (Layer 1), 40% apply/analyze (Layer 2-3), 30% evaluate/create (Layer
  4).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 30 flashcard objects. No extra text.'
