  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards using the EXACT schema provided below. Integrate:

  - Learning objectives (span REMEMBER to CREATE).

  - Scaffolding layers (10 cards/layer, progressive complexity).

  - Active learning ties (e.g., reference discussions/exercises in explanations).

  - Research: OWASP WSTG-ATHZ-03 (full tests: ID tamper, role mods, Burp Suite, server checks); Best Practices: 1. Recon endpoints/roles.
  2. Identify boundaries. 3. Proxy intercept/tamper (userId, role). 4. Test escalation (numeric, forced browse). 5. Verify
  server-side. Sources: https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/stable/4.2/Testing_for_Broken_Access_Control/WSTG-ATHZ-03;
