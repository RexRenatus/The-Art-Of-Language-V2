  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the trade-offs of account lockout policies (e.g., 3-5 failed attempts locking for 30 minutes):
    How do they balance brute force protection against DoS risks to legitimate users and user frustration? Reference OWASP
    WSTG-ATHN-03 and NIST SP 800-63B/800-63-4. Consider real-world scenarios like high-traffic apps.'
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains brute force variants (simple brute force, dictionary, hybrid) with examples
    and non-examples; the partner teaches lockout mechanisms (counters, thresholds, unlocks), DoS risks, and mitigations.
    Switch roles and quiz each other on misconceptions, such as lockouts stopping all attacks.
  problem_solving: In a safe lab environment (e.g., DVWA or OWASP Juice Shop), groups simulate ethical brute force testing
    using tools like Burp Suite or Hydra. Verify lockout effectiveness after thresholds, test DoS impact on multiple accounts,
    propose improvements (e.g., CAPTCHA integration), and discuss ethics, real-world applications, and legal considerations.
