When the path passed to <code>include</code> originates from untrusted user input without proper validation, it allows an attacker to specify a URL, causing the server to fetch and execute code from a remote location, because the function interprets valid URLs as file paths.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly describe <code>include</code> as only for local files, as having built-in sanitization, or as being for database connections. Its core function is file inclusion, and its vulnerability arises from how it handles external paths.",
        "analogy": "Think of <code>include</code> as a messenger who is told to fetch a document. If the messenger is given a vague instruction like 'fetch the document from this address', and the address could be anywhere (local or remote), the messenger might fetch something dangerous if the address isn't verified."

        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly associate different capabilities, testing scopes, or unrelated vulnerability types with LFI and RFI. The key difference in testing lies in the nature of the payload used: local path manipulation for LFI versus remote URLs for RFI.",
