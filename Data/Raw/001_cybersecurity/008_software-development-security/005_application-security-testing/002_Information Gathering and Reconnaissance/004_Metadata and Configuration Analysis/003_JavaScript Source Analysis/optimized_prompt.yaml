active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare static analysis tools like CodeQL and SonarQube for JavaScript vulnerability detection—debate
    their strengths, weaknesses, and ideal use cases, using real-world examples from OWASP Top 10 (e.g., XSS via innerHTML)
    and NIST SSDF practices.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    so low risk''); 2) Partial truths (e.g., tool strength but wrong vuln type); 3) Confusable terms (e.g., XSS vs. CSRF);
    4) Outdated practices (e.g., using innerHTML safely). Ensure distractors promote critical thinking.'

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for university pedagogy (Bloom''s Taxonomy), active learning, and scaffolding.
  Cover all voter priorities: completeness (tools: CodeQL, SonarQube [open-source static analyzer for JS vulns like XSS, integrates
  CI/CD], ESLint-security, Semgrep; vulns: XSS/innerHTML, prototype pollution, eval(); standards: OWASP Top 10/ASVS, NIST
  SP 800-218 SSDF; sources: OWASP.org/top10, nist.gov/SP800-218, github.com/github/codeql, sonarqube.org, semgrep.dev), examples,
  prior knowledge links.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the learning_objectives array here verbatim].

  **Active Learning:** Incorporate ties to [discussion_prompt, peer_teaching_activity, problem_solving_exercise].

  **Scaffolding:** Distribute cards: 30% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 20% Layer 4.

  **Schema:** [Use exact flashcard_schema]. Aim for balance: 40% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 30% APPLY/ANALYZE, 30% EVALUATE/CREATE.
  Include JS snippets, tool commands, comparisons.


  Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''Question A)opt1 B)opt2 C)opt3 D)opt4'', ''back'': ''**Correct: A** Explanation...''}].
