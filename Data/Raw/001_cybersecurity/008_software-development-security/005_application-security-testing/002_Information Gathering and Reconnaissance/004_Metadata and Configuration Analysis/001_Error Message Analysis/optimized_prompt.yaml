  discussion_prompt: 'Given this verbose stack trace from a web app: ''java.lang.NullPointerException at com.example.app.UserService.getUser(UserService.java:45)
    ... DB query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=1'', debate the security risks it poses (e.g., path disclosure, query structure)
    and propose user-friendly alternatives that mitigate information leakage while aiding legitimate debugging. Consider usability
    vs. security trade-offs.'
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student presents a real-world error message (e.g., from OWASP vulnerable apps like WebGoat),
    the partner explains potential leaks (e.g., stack traces revealing internals) and teaches a secure handling method (e.g.,
    generic messages + server-side logging); switch roles and discuss misconceptions like 'detailed errors always help users.'
  problem_solving: 'Provide screenshots of error messages from applications (e.g., via Burp Suite on test apps like DVWA);
    students identify leaked info (e.g., DB queries, paths), classify severity per OWASP WSTG v4.8, and design fixes like
    custom error pages. Extend to role-playing: one group as attackers exploiting leaks, another as devs mitigating.'

  - Learning objectives: [paste learning_objectives array here]

  - Active learning for engagement: [paste active_learning here]

  - Scaffolding: Progress from Layer 1 (definitions) to Layer 4 (integration), using provided research context.

  - Research: Core concepts (error handling, stack traces, info leakage); OWASP WSTG v4.8 (test for leaks via forced errors);
  CWE-209; CIS Control 16 (secure app security, no exposure); Mitigations (custom pages, server logging). Sources: OWASP WSTG
  https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/; CWE-209 https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/209.html; Examples:
  Insecure ''SQLException: SELECT * FROM users''; Secure ''An error occurred.''

  - Big picture: Prevents recon-to-exploit in pentesting/SDLC.
