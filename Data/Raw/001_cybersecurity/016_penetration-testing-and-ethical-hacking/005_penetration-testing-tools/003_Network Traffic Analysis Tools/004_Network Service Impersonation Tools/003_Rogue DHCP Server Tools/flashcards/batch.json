        "core_logic": "When DHCP snooping is enabled, switch ports are classified as trusted (connected to legitimate DHCP servers) or untrusted (connected to clients or potential rogue servers). Configuring a port as untrusted means the switch will drop any DHCP server messages (like DHCPOFFER) received on that port, thereby blocking rogue servers because these messages should only come from trusted sources.",
