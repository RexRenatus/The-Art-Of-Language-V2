active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical and legal implications of using wireless packet capture tools
    in penetration testing (e.g., monitor mode on public Wi-Fi). Reference real-world cases and frameworks like PTES. What
    mitigations ensure compliance with laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ cards (30% of total): Generate 3 plausible distractors based on: 1) Common misconceptions
    (e.g., ''promiscuous mode works for wireless'' instead of monitor); 2) Partial truths (e.g., tool features swapped); 3)
    Similar concepts/tools (e.g., Wireshark vs. tcpdump); 4) Web/research errors (e.g., outdated Wi-Fi standards). Ensure
    distractors teach by correction in explanation. Mark correct option as {''correct'': true} in options array.'

  Topic: ''Wireless Packet Capture Tools'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration
  Testing Tools > 006_Network Traffic Analysis Tools > Packet Capture Tools > Wireless Packet Capture Tools). Consensus from
  7 voters (67.1% approval): Emphasize completeness (tools: Wireshark monitor mode, Airodump-ng/Aircrack-ng, Kismet, tcpdump/tshark;
  prerequisites; commands/examples), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression, 4-layer scaffolding), accuracy (monitor mode essential),
  prior knowledge (OSI/TCP/IP, wired capture), ethical notes, PTES/MITRE integration.


  Web context: Wireless capture intercepts 802.11 frames for pentesting (vulns like WEP/WPA). Tools enable real-time analysis,
  decryption. PTES guides usage in recon/analysis phases.


  Incorporate these EXACT learning objectives: [insert array above]. Active learning for engagement: [reference activities
  indirectly via real-world scenarios]. Use this 4-layer scaffolding: [insert scaffolding details above].


  Generate flashcards per this SCHEMA: [insert flashcard_schema details above]. Output ONLY a valid JSON array of 50 flashcards,
  no extra text. Ensure high-quality: university-level, active recall, misconceptions addressed, ethical hacking focus (e.g.,
  ''Use only on authorized networks''). Cover voter priorities: hands-on commands, tool comparisons, NIST/standards if applicable,
  full sources (e.g., Wireshark.org, Aircrack-ng.org).'
