  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema provided. Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full list above].

  - Active Learning: Link flashcards to components where relevant.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute across 4 layers.

  - Research Context: NIST SP 800-63B (https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html): length primary (min 8, prefer 12+),
  no composition rules, verifier resistance (salted hashes), screen breached lists. Tools: Crunch (e.g., crunch min max charset
  -t mask -o file), Mentalist, Hashcat simulation. Ethical pen testing only.

  - Voter Priorities: Completeness on NIST (length > complexity), tools/examples, Bloom''s progression.


  Output ONLY in JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"front": "...", "back": {"correct_answer": "...", "explanation": "...",
  "distractors": ["A: why wrong", "B: why wrong", "C: why wrong"], "bloom_level": "...", "scaffolding_layer": "...", "source":
  "...", "active_learning_link": "..."}}. Ensure distractors follow protocol. Balance Bloom''s/layers. No additional text.'
