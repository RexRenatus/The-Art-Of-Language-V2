active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a penetration testing engagement, you discover a password-protected ZIP file containing user credentials
    on a target system. Discuss the ethical, legal, and technical considerations of using zip2john to extract the hash for
    cracking, including potential risks of weak vs. strong archive encryption.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - 'Misconceptions: Confuse with forensic content hashing (e.g., NSRL lookups) instead of password hash extraction.'
  - 'Related but incorrect: Mix up with file dump tools like samdump2 or general archivers like 7z.'
  - 'Edge cases: Unsupported formats, encryption types (e.g., AES vs. legacy), or cracking tools (Hashcat vs. John).'
  - 'Common errors: Incorrect command syntax or output formats.'
  - Ensure distractors are plausible (50-70% likely to tempt learners) but clearly wrong upon analysis.

  CRITICAL CONTEXT: Archive file hash extractors (e.g., zip2john, rar2john, 7z2john) recover password hashes or candidates
  from protected archives (ZIP, RAR, 7Z) for offline cracking with Hashcat/John the Ripper in ethical hacking. NOT forensic
  content hashing (e.g., no NSRL/known good/bad files).

  Ensure pedagogical depth: Tie to Bloom''s progression, active elements, and pentesting workflows. Use accurate commands/examples
  (e.g., ''zip2john file.zip''). High voter consensus (85.7%) prioritizes accuracy in password cracking context.'
