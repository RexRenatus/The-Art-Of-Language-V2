  discussion_prompt: In a penetration test with explicit scope, should pentesters extract hashes from an encrypted container
    (e.g., VeraCrypt volume) without full decryption? Debate ethical risks, legal boundaries (e.g., CFAA implications), efficacy
    vs. alternatives like key recovery, and real-world trade-offs in red team operations.
  peer_teaching: 'Pair students: One teaches the other to use unblob on a sample firmware image (e.g., from VulnHub) to extract
    embedded files, then compute and verify SHA-256 hashes using sha256sum or openssl dgst -sha256; switch roles and address
    misconceptions like ''hash extractors decrypt data'' (they don''t; they parse metadata/headers).'
  problem_solving: 'Provide a safe, ethical lab image with a VeraCrypt container containing planted password hashes in headers.
    Students: 1) Use veracrypt2hashcat or hashcat-utils to extract hashes; 2) Verify integrity with sha256sum; 3) Crack offline
    using hashcat; 4) Debrief on workflow integration and failure modes (e.g., header corruption).'

  - Learning Objectives: [insert array above]

  - Active Learning: [insert components above, e.g., ethics discussion, peer unblob demo, VeraCrypt cracking lab]

  - Scaffolding: [insert 4 layers above, including concept map, FIPS, tools like foremost/scalpel]

  - Big Picture: Pentesting flow—acquire image → extract → hash integrity → crack passwords → access.

  - Sources: unblob GitHub, hashcat-utils, binwalk, VeraCrypt docs, FIPS 140-2.
