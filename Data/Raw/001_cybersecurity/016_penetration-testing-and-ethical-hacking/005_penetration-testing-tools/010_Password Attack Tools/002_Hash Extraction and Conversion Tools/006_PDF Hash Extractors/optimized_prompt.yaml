active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical implications of using PDF hash extractors in penetration testing.
    Consider scenarios where extracting hashes from corporate PDFs could reveal weak passwords—how does this align with ISO/IEC
    27001 and legal boundaries? Provide real-world examples and propose mitigation strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing Tools.
  Generate 30 high-quality MCQ flashcards on ''PDF Hash Extractors'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing
  And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing Tools > 005_Password Attack Tools > Hash Extraction and Conversion Tools > PDF
  Hash Extractors). Cover all Bloom''s levels via these objectives: [insert learning_objectives array]. Incorporate scaffolding
  layers: [insert scaffolding object]. Include active learning hooks in explanations. Use research context: PDF encryption
  (RC4 1.1-1.6, AES 1.7+), tools pdf2john/pdf2hashcat, NIST 800-63B, ISO 27001, sources (John docs: https://www.openwall.com/john/doc/,
  Hashcat: https://hashcat.net/wiki/). Ensure completeness: Detail versions, hashes, ethics.


  Output JSON array of 30 flashcards, balanced across layers/objectives (e.g., 5 per layer). Each flashcard follows this schema:
  {''front'': ''Question + A/B/C/D options'', ''back'': {''correct_answer'': ''A: Full answer'', ''distractors'': [{''option'':
  ''B: Text'', ''why_wrong'': ''Reason''}], ''explanation'': ''Detailed (ref Bloom/layer/source/active)'', ''related_concept'':
  ''Layer X, Prerequisite Y'', ''difficulty'': ''Analyze''}}. Vary question types: definitions, comparisons, steps, critiques,
  workflows. Distractors per protocol: misconceptions, similars, pitfalls. Promote active recall, ethical awareness, prior
  knowledge links.'
