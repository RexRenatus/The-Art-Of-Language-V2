active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using hybrid attacks versus pure dictionary or brute-force
    methods in offline password cracking. Consider factors like computational efficiency, success rates on real-world passwords,
    and ethical implications in penetration testing. Support arguments with examples from Hashcat or John the Ripper.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Hybrid Attack Tools. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on hybrid attacks in offline password cracking (e.g., Hashcat -a 6/7 combining dictionary
  with mask/brute-force appendages; John the Ripper hybrids)—NOT AI-pen testing hybrids.


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet, spanning all Bloom''s levels. Use this scaffolding:

  Layer 1 (Foundation: terms like dictionary, brute-force, masks, hash types).

  Layer 2 (Components: Hashcat/John modes, rules).

  Layer 3 (Implementation: commands, examples).

  Layer 4 (Integration: optimization, pen testing chains).


  Incorporate learning objectives: [insert full list from JSON]. Include active learning hooks (e.g., ''Relate to discussion:
  ...'').


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards, each as:

  {

  "id": 1,

  "bloom_level": "APPLY",

  "scaffolding_layer": "Layer 3",

  "front": "Question text (MCQ preferred: ''What Hashcat mode combines dict + mask? A) -a 6 B) -a 0 ...'')",

  "back": {

  "answer": "A) -a 6",

  "explanation": "Detailed...",

  "distractors": ["B: Explanation", "C: Explanation", "D: Explanation"],

  "source": "Hashcat docs"

  }

  }


  Ensure 40% MCQ with 3 distractors (per protocol: semantic error, misconception, partial truth). 20% cloze. Balance: 20%
  per Bloom''s pair (Remember/Understand, Apply/Analyze, Evaluate/Create). Promote ethical hacking: Add lab safety notes.
