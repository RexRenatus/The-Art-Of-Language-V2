active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the evolution of password guidelines from traditional complexity rules
    (e.g., requiring uppercase, numbers, symbols) to NIST SP 800-63-4 recommendations (e.g., minimum 8 characters, favoring
    longer passphrases). Use examples from tools like zxcvbn to argue which approach better resists real-world attacks like
    dictionary or brute-force.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions: 1) outdated rules (e.g.,
    ''must have 3/4 character types''), 2) tool-specific errors (e.g., confuse zxcvbn score with cracking time), 3) overgeneralizations
    (e.g., ''longer always better without context''). Ensure distractors are realistic from voter/ research context (e.g.,
    pre-NIST complexity focus).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing Tools.
  Topic: Password Strength Analyzers (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing
  Tools > 005_Password Attack Tools > Password Analysis Tools > Password Strength Analyzers). Use the provided learning objectives,
  active learning ideas, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema to create high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized flashcards.


  Incorporate: NIST SP 800-63-4 (min 8 chars, longer preferred over complexity), tools (zxcvbn, CrackStation, HowSecureIsMyPassword,
  Have I Been Pwned, Password Haystack, GlassPassword, Hashcat rules), prior knowledge (brute-force/dictionary attacks), best
  practices (complete truncated sections: length guidelines, policy integration).


  Structure output as a numbered list of flashcards following the schema exactly (mix basic, cloze, MCQ). Ensure Bloom''s
  progression: simple recall first, then apply/analyze/eval/create. Distractors per protocol. Each flashcard ties to a scaffolding
  layer.


  Generate 50 flashcards covering all layers comprehensively. Output only the flashcards in clean, copy-pasteable format for
  Anki/Quizlet.'
