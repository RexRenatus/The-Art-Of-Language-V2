active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical implications of using memory credential dumpers like Mimikatz
    in penetration testing. Consider scenarios where consent is obtained versus unauthorized use, and propose rules of engagement
    to ensure legal compliance and prevent real-world harm.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: (1) Common misconception (e.g., ''LSASS stores plaintext only'' vs.
    hashes/tickets), (2) Confusable similar concept (e.g., SAM vs. LSA Secrets), (3) Partial truth (e.g., tool name mix-up:
    ProcDump vs. Procdump). Ensure plausible for experts but wrong for learners. Prioritize from voter suggestions (e.g.,
    incomplete LSA description).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education on ''Memory Credential Dumpers'' (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing Tools > 005_Password Attack Tools
  > Credential Harvesting Tools > Memory Credential Dumpers). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema,
  covering all Bloom''s levels and scaffolding layers. Strictly emphasize ethical, legal use in authorized pentesting only—include
  warnings in explanations.

  **Flashcard Schema:** [Insert the flashcard_schema object here]


  **Active Learning Integration:** Weave in elements like ''Discuss: How would you apply this in a peer teaching on Mimikatz?''
  for higher-level cards.


  **Content Sources:** Integrate voter priorities (complete LSA Secrets: registry-stored cached creds; tools: Mimikatz, ProcDump;
  MITRE mappings); research (LSASS, hashes, volatile memory).
