active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the ethical implications and detection challenges of Kerberos ticket extraction techniques like
    Golden Ticket (T1558.001) vs. Kerberoasting (T1558.003), referencing MITRE ATT&CK T1558 sub-techniques. Consider real-world
    pen testing scenarios and propose balanced defenses.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
