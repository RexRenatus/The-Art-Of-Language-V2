active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In light of recent cloud breaches like Capital One (2019), debate whether automated cloud configuration
    scanners are sufficient on their own or if they must be complemented by manual penetration testing. Use specific examples
    of misconfigurations (e.g., public S3 buckets, IAM over-privileging) to support your position, drawing on tools like Prowler
    and benchmarks like CIS or MCSB.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Common misconceptions (e.g., confuse with network vuln scanners like Nessus).

    - Partial truths (e.g., wrong tool name or cloud support).

    - Edge cases (e.g., outdated tools or non-security features).

    - Voter/research errors (e.g., misstate benchmarks as ASB instead of MCSB). Ensure distractors are realistic to promote
    active recall.'

  under the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing Tools > 003_Vulnerability
  Assessment Tools > Specialized Vulnerability Scanners > Cloud Configuration Scanners.


  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives** (Bloom''s Taxonomy): [Paste the full learning_objectives array here].

  - **Active Learning**: Embed discussion, peer-teaching, and problem-solving concepts into higher-level cards (e.g., evaluative
  questions on Capital One breach, workflow explanations).

  - **Scaffolding**: Distribute cards across 4 layers: [Paste the full scaffolding array here].

  - **Research Context**: Cloud configuration scanners automate misconfiguration detection in AWS/Azure/GCP against CIS/AS
  B/MCSB benchmarks. Tools: Prowler (open-source AWS/Azure/GCP), ScoutSuite (multi-cloud), Checkov (IaC), CloudSploit, Prisma
  Cloud, Wiz, Azure Defender. Link to cloud pentesting, posture management, misconfigs (public S3, IAM). Prior breaches: Capital
  One (2019).

  - **Flashcard Schema**: Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards matching [Paste the full flashcard_schema.structure, distractor_protocol,
  generation_requirements here].


  Generate flashcards optimized for Anki/Spaced Repetition: progressive difficulty, active recall, spaced by Bloom''s/scaffolding.
  Ensure university pedagogy: scaffolded, real-world applied, critical thinking. No extra text outside JSON array.'
