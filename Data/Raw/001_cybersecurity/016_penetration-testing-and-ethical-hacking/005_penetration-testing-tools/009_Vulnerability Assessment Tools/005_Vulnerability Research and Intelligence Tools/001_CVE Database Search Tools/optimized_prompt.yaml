active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss the limitations of CVE databases (e.g., delayed entries, incomplete data) compared to third-party
    tools like Vulners or Exploit-DB. How might these gaps impact a penetration test? Provide examples and propose mitigations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
