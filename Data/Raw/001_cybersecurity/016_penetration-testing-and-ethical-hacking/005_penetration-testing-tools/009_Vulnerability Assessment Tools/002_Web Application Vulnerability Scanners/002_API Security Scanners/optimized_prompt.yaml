active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group of 3-4, debate the most critical vulnerabilities from the OWASP API Security Top 10 (e.g.,
    Broken Object Level Authorization, Excessive Data Exposure) and evaluate how tools like Burp Suite API extensions versus
    42Crunch best mitigate them in a cloud-native microservices environment. Cite pros/cons and real-world breach examples
    (e.g., from OWASP case studies).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    add-ons). 2. Common errors: From voter notes (e.g., overlook pros/cons). 3. Partial truths: Mix features (Burp fuzzing
    as ''AI-driven'' like APIsec). Ensure 70% plausible to trained eye.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing Tools.
  Topic: 006_API Security Scanners (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing
  Tools > 003_Vulnerability Assessment Tools > Web Application Vulnerability Scanners > 006_API Security Scanners). Use provided
  research: OWASP API Security Top 10, REST Security Cheat Sheet (focus: discovery, auth, validation), scanners (OWASP ZAP
  API add-ons: free, extensible; Burp Suite API Hacker/extensions: proxy+fuzzing, pros: depth/cons:cost; 42Crunch: spec validation;
  Wallarm: cloud/WAF; APIsec: AI; Postman plugins: automation). Integrate voter priorities: completeness on tools/pros/cons/comparisons;
  pedagogy via Bloom''s/scaffolding.


  Generate 26 flashcards following this EXACT schema:

  {flashcard_schema above}


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: Ensure coverage (1-2 cards per objective).

  - Active Learning: Link each card to one activity.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute across 4 layers.

  - Bloom''s: REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND (L1-2), APPLY/ANALYZE (L3), EVALUATE/CREATE (L4).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'':
  ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''distractors'': {... or null}, ''tags'': [...], ''active_learning_link'': ''...''}},
