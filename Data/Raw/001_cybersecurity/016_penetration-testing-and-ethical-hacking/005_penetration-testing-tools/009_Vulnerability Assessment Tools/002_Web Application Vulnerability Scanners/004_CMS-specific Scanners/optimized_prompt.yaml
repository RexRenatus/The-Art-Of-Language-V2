active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the risks of relying solely on CMS-specific scanners versus combining them
    with manual testing for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities like XSS and SQLi. Provide real-world examples from recent CMS exploits
    and propose mitigation strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

      Ensure distractors are realistic based on research context; avoid obvious errors. Balance across topics.'
