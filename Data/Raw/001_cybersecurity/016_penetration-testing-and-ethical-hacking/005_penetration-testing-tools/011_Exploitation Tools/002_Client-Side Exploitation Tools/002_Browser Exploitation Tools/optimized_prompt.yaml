active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical boundaries of using browser exploitation tools like BeEF in
    penetration testing. Consider scenarios where client-side attacks could blur lines between ethical hacking and unauthorized
    access, referencing OWASP guidelines and legal frameworks like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). What safeguards
    ensure responsible use?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    BeEF version feature). Ensure distractors test nuance without misleading.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on
  ''Browser 005_007_Exploitation Tools'' (exact Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking >

  Tools). Emphasize ethical/legal use in ALL cards.


  **Content Foundation:** Use this scaffolded knowledge:

  - Prior Knowledge: XSS/CSRF (OWASP Top 10), client-server arch, intro pentest.

  - Layer 1 (Foundation): Definitions (Browser Exploitation, BeEF), pentest lifecycle role.

  - Layer 2 (Components): BeEF architecture (hook.js, modules, UI), OWASP WSTG-CLIENT-01.

  - Layer 3 (Implementation): Step-by-step install/hook/use with ethics.

  - Layer 4 (Integration): BeEF + Metasploit, real-world pentests.

  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s):** [Insert full list from above].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Draw questions from discussion (ethics), peer teaching (install), problem-solving (labs).


  **Flashcard Output Format (JSON array):** Each card: {"front": "Question text with 4 MC options (A-D, one correct)", "back":
  "Correct Answer (e.g., A) | Explanation | Bloom''s Level | Ethical Note | Hierarchy Tag", "type": "MCQ" or "Cloze"}.


  **Schema:** [Insert full flashcard_schema from above]. Ensure progressive difficulty (10 cards/Layer 1-2, 20/Layer 3, 20/Layer
  4). Varied types: 60% MCQ (w/ distractors), 40% Cloze/Short Answer. High recall, application focus.'
