active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical implications of using office document exploit tools in penetration
    testing. Consider scenarios where these tools could be misused, the importance of client consent and lab isolation, and
    how to balance offensive capabilities with defensive countermeasures like MITRE ATT&CK mitigations. Reference real-world
    examples from cybersecurity reports.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ethical penetration testing.
  Generate 25 high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards on ''Office Document Exploit Tools'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing Tools > 005_007_Exploitation Tools > Client-Side 005_007_Exploitation
  Tools > Office Document Exploit Tools). Strictly emphasize ethical hacking: include disclaimers on lab-only use, no real-world
  malice, defensive countermeasures, and responsible disclosure in EVERY relevant card''s explanation.


  Incorporate:
