active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'Evaluate the effectiveness of smishing versus email phishing in modern attacks: Discuss pros (e.g.,
    higher open rates), cons (e.g., shorter message limits), and key defenses (e.g., SMS firewalls, user training). Support
    with real-world examples like ''Smishing Deluge''.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    email'' instead of SMS), 1 from related but incorrect tools (e.g., ''Metasploit'' for exploitation vs. smishing), 1 from
    ethical violations (e.g., ''No consent needed for testing''). Ensure distractors are realistic from web research (e.g.,
    Kaspersky, CrowdStrike).'

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use discussion/peer/problem-solving prompts in scenario cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers (tag each: Layer 1-4).

  - Ethical Focus: Every card emphasizes responsible, legal pentesting use (e.g., consent, no real harm).

  - Research Context: Draw from Twilio/TextBelt/Gophish/SET/pywhatkit; cases like ''Smishing Deluge''; sources (Kaspersky,
  CrowdStrike).
