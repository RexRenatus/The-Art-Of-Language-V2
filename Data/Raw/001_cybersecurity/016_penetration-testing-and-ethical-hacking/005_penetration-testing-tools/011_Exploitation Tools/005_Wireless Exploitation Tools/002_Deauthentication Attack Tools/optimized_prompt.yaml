active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a debate format, argue whether deauthentication attacks should be restricted to authorized penetration
    testing only or if they have legitimate defensive uses (e.g., red teaming or intrusion detection testing). Support arguments
    with ethical hacking standards (e.g., OSSTMM, PTES), real-world cases like the KRACK vulnerability or WPA3 protections,
    and legal considerations under laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per card based on common misconceptions from voters/research: 1)
    Superficially similar (e.g., ''airmon-ng stop'' instead of ''start''); 2) Related but wrong context (e.g., ''iwconfig''
    for old tools); 3) Advanced trap (e.g., ''aireplay-ng --assoc'' for association, not deauth). Ensure distractors teach
    via error (e.g., ''This is for ARP replay, not deauth''). Balance across layers: 40% Layer 1/2 (recall), 40% Layer 3 (apply),
    20% Layer 4 (analyze/evaluate).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing Tools
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing Tools > 005_007_Exploitation
  Tools > Wireless 005_007_Exploitation Tools > Deauthentication Attack Tools). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized
  for spaced repetition (Anki), strictly adhering to the provided schema, learning objectives, active learning components,
  and 4-layer scaffolding. Emphasize ethical hacking: all examples are for authorized pentesting labs only; include warnings
  on legal use (e.g., CFAA, RoE).
