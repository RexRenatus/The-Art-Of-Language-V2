active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of browser-based tools (e.g., Wappalyzer extension) versus
    CLI tools (e.g., WhatWeb) for web reconnaissance in penetration testing scenarios. Consider factors like stealth, automation,
    and accuracy in real-world ethical hacking engagements.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Use common misconceptions (e.g., 'Wappalyzer only checks HTTP headers' vs. full methods)
    - Partial truths (e.g., similar tools like Nmap for ports, not web tech)
    - Plausible alternatives (e.g., Burp Suite vs. WhatWeb for recon)
    - Outdated/incorrect versions (e.g., 'BuiltWith detects only CMS, not JS libraries')
    - Avoid obvious wrongs; ensure 60-70% learner error rate for effective spaced repetition
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing Tools.
  Topic: Web Technology Identification Tools (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration
  Testing Tools > 002_Information Gathering Tools > Web Reconnaissance Tools > Web Technology Identification Tools). Use the
  provided learning objectives, active learning activities, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema to generate high-quality
  Anki-compatible flashcards.


  Content Context:

  - Tools: Wappalyzer (browser/CLI, analyzes HTML/headers/JS/meta), WhatWeb (CLI signatures), BuiltWith (web trends).

  - Key Insight: Knowing a site uses a particular CMS (e.g., WordPress) allows targeted testing for known vulnerabilities
  (OWASP).

  - Sources: https://www.wappalyzer.com/, https://www.morningstarsecurity.com/research/whatweb, https://builtwith.com/, OWASP
  Testing Guide v4, NIST SP 800-115.

  - Prereqs: HTTP basics, web recon.


  Incorporate:

  - Bloom''s progression per objectives.

  - Scaffolding layers explicitly.

  - Voter priorities: Completeness (tools, OWASP), pedagogy (objectives), scaffolding.

  - Active elements: Questions prompting discussion/analysis.


  Generate 50 flashcards:

  - 40% Multiple Choice (follow distractor protocol).

  - 30% Cloze.

  - 30% Short Answer.

  - Balance: Layers 1-4 evenly; Bloom''s as per schema.

  - Output JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''references'': [...],
  ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''#''}}].

  Ensure flashcards promote active recall, spaced repetition, and higher-order thinking.'
