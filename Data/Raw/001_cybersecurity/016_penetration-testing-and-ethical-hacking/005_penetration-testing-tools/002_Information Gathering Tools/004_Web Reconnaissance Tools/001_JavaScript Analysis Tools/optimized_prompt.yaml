active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast static and dynamic JavaScript analysis in the context of web reconnaissance. When
    might one approach reveal vulnerabilities the other misses? Use OWASP Top 10 examples (e.g., XSS sinks or sensitive data
    exposure).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Use the following to generate high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized flashcards:


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full learning_objectives array here]

  **Active Learning:** Incorporate concepts from activities (e.g., discussions on static/dynamic, peer teaching on AST/taint)
  to inspire scenario cards.

  **Scaffolding Layers:** Distribute cards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4.

  **Key Content:** Core concepts (JS Recon, Static/Dynamic Analysis, Endpoints, Secrets, AST); Tools (LinkFinder, SecretFinder,
  JSFScan.sh, Retire.js, WebCrack, Esprima, JSpector); Vulns (OWASP Top 10, CWE-798); Usage examples; Integrations (Burp/ZAP).


  **Flashcard Schema:** Follow exactly:

  - Types: 40% Basic Recall, 40% Multiple Choice (1 correct + 3 distractors per protocol), 20% Application/Scenario.

  - Distractor Protocol: [Insert full distractor_protocol here]

  - Explanation Requirements: [Insert full explanation_requirements here]

  - Balance: Span all Bloom''s levels/objectives; Tag each card with layer and Bloom''s level.


  Generate 75 flashcards in JSON array format: [{''id'':1, ''type'':''MCQ'', ''front'':''...'', ''back'':''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'':1,
  ''blooms_level'':''Remember'', ''tags'':[''LinkFinder'',''static-analysis'']}, ...]. Ensure cards promote active recall,
  avoid verbatim content, and reference real tools/sources for authenticity.'
