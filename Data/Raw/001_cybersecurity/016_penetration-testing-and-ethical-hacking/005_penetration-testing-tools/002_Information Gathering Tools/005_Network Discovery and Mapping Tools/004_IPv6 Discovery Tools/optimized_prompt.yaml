active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a dual-stack (IPv4/IPv6) network with 60%+ adoption rates, discuss why traditional IPv4 tools like
    Nmap without -6 might create blind spots in pentests. How does IPv6's NDP replace ARP, and what evasion techniques could
    attackers use? Reference RFC 4861 and tools like alive6.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors for MCQ based on common misconceptions: 1. IPv4 analogs (e.g., ''arp-scan''
    instead of ''alive6''), 2. Incorrect flags/tools (e.g., ''nmap -4'' vs ''-6''), 3. Confused concepts (e.g., ''DHCPv6''
    vs ''SLAAC'' for discovery). Ensure distractors are realistic from pentest pitfalls, e.g., ignoring link-local addresses.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing Tools.
  Topic: IPv6 Discovery Tools (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing Tools
  > 002_Information Gathering Tools > Network Discovery and Mapping Tools > IPv6 Discovery Tools). Use the provided learning
  objectives, active learning activities, scaffolding layers, and flashcard schema to generate high-quality, optimized flashcards.


  Incorporate voter consensus: Focus on tools like Nmap -6, thc-ipv6 toolkit (thc-ping6, thc-addr6, alive6, detect-new-ip6,
  passivedns6), ipv6scan, Masscan IPv6, rdnsspy, passhunt, ipv6toolkit, SIAC. Include brief descriptions, usage examples (e.g.,
  ''nmap -6 -sn 2001:db8::/64''), use cases in pentests. Link to IPv4 (NDP vs ARP), IPv6 adoption (60%+ dual-stack), RFCs
  (4861 NDP, 4291 Addressing), NIST SP 800-119.


  Structure output by scaffolding layers (generate 10-15 cards per layer). Follow schema exactly: JSON array of objects with
  ''front'', ''back'' (answer, explanation, distractors), ''tags''. Ensure Bloom''s progression, active learning hints, plausible
  distractors. Promote hands-on: Reference labs (VirtualBox/GNS3). Make engaging for ethical hacking mastery.'
