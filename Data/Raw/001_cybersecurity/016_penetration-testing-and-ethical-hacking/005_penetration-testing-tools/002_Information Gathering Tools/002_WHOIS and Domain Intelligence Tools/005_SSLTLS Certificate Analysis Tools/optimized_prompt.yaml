active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of online tools (e.g., Qualys SSL Labs, Censys) versus command-line
    tools (e.g., testssl.sh, SSLyze) for SSL/TLS analysis in stealthy penetration testing scenarios. Consider factors like
    detection risk, depth of analysis, and automation potential.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing tools.\
  \ Topic: SSL/TLS Certificate Analysis Tools (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration\
  \ Testing Tools > 002_Information Gathering Tools > WHOIS and Domain Intelligence Tools > SSL/TLS Certificate Analysis Tools).\
  \ Voter consensus (82.9% approval): Emphasize tools like Qualys SSL Labs, testssl.sh, OpenSSL s_client, Censys, Nmap ssl-enum-ciphers/NSE\
  \ scripts, SSLyze, ImmuniWeb, crt.sh. Include prior knowledge (networking, SSL/TLS basics, WHOIS/DNS), big picture (passive\
