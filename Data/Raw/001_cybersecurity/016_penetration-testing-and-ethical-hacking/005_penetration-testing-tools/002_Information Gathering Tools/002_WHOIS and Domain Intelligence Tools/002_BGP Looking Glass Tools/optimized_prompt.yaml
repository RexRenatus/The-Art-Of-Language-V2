active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Analyze the 2021 Facebook BGP hijack or 2022 Fastly route leak using BGP Looking Glass tools (e.g., bgp.tools).
    In groups, debate how attackers exploited BGP vulnerabilities, categorize the risks (e.g., traffic diversion, DoS), and
    propose countermeasures like RPKI deployment or MANRS adherence. Compare findings from multiple vantage points and connect
    to penetration testing reconnaissance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Active Learning: Embed scenarios from discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving into flashcards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute content across 4 layers: [insert full layers above].

  - Research Context: BGP exchanges routing between ASes; Looking Glass queries tables/attributes (AS_PATH); hijacks/leaks
  (2021 Facebook, 2022 Fastly); tools: bgp.he.net, bgp.tools, routeviews.org; standards: RPKI (RFC 6480), IRR, MANRS; sources:
  deploy.equinix.com, rpki.readthedocs.io, blog.cloudflare.com, manrs.org.

  - Best Practices: Multi-vantage queries, RPKI/IRR validation, anomaly detection for pentesting recon.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following the exact schema: [insert full schema above]. Use Bloom''s verbs for questions.
  Ensure university-level pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, no hints on front. Output ONLY a JSON array
  of flashcard objects. No additional text.'
