active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the effectiveness of integrating SLAs into remediation tracking tools (e.g., Tenable.sc dashboards)
    versus manual processes in a penetration test report. Discuss pros (e.g., accountability), cons (e.g., rigidity), and
    real-world failures (e.g., delayed patches leading to breaches).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use prompts/activities to inspire scenario-based cards (e.g., debate SLAs in MCQs). [INSERT FULL ACTIVE
  LEARNING]

  - Scaffolding: Generate cards layered progressively. [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING]


  Content Sources: Definitions/processes from research (remediation lifecycle, vuln mgmt, SLAs). Standards: NIST SP 800-53
  RA-5, PTES. Tools: DefectDojo (workflows), Jira (tickets), Tenable.sc/Qualys VMDR/Rapid7 InsightVM (dashboards), Dradis/Faraday
  (collab), ServiceNow/VULNERA/FarSight. Prerequisites: Vuln scanners/reporting.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD SCHEMA]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as {"front":
  "...", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "bloom_level": "...", "layer": "...", "related_objective": "..."}}.
  Ensure variety, high-quality distractors, and alignment to Bloom''s/active learning. Generate 50 cards balanced across layers/Bloom.'
