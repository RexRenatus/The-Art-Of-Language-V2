active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of using open-source note-taking apps like CherryTree
    or Obsidian versus commercial ones like Notion or OneNote for penetration testing documentation. Consider security implications,
    collaboration features, and alignment with PTES phases. Support your arguments with real-world examples from pentest workflows.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Distractors must be plausible: Use similar tools (e.g., Evernote for CherryTree), common misconceptions (e.g., ''No
      need for hierarchical structure''), or partial truths (e.g., ''Good for general notes but not pentest'').'
    - 'Avoid obvious wrongs: Base on real alternatives or voter suggestions.'
    - '3 distractors per card: One feature mismatch, one security oversight, one workflow incompatibility.'
    - 'Vary difficulty: Align with Bloom''s level (easier for REMEMBER, nuanced for EVALUATE).'
