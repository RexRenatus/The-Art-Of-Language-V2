  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the role of timing manipulation in modern red teaming: Does it enhance
    IDS resilience testing or risk enabling real-world attacks? Reference MITRE ATT&CK T1562 (Impair Defenses) and real-world
    examples like Stuxnet''s stealth tactics. Support your position with pros/cons.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Spaced Repetition using the exact schema provided. Incorporate these
  pedagogical elements:


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s Taxonomy progression):** [Insert full list from above].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Draw from discussion (ethics/MITRE), peer teaching (tool demos), problem-solving (scenarios)
  for applied cards.


  **Scaffolding Layers:** Distribute cards: 6 Layer 1 (foundation), 6 Layer 2 (components), 7 Layer 3 (implementation), 6
  Layer 4 (integration). Link prior knowledge (IDS/IPS basics).


  **Key Content (from research/voters):** Focus on tools (Scapy packet timing, hping3 ICMP delays, Slowloris HTTP, Nmap --scan-delay/--max-rate,
  Python time.sleep() scripts); techniques (TOCTOU, delay/burst/sync); MITRE T1562/T1027; Stuxnet example; evasion vs. anomaly/signature
  detection.


  **Output Format (strict JSON array of objects):** Each flashcard: {"id":1, "type":"multiple_choice|basic|cloze_deletion",
  "bloom_level":"REMEMBER", "layer":1, "tags":["Scapy","evasion"], "front":"...", "back":"...", "explanation":"..."}. Ensure
  variety, no duplicates, active recall focus. Distractors per protocol.'
