  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the ethical and operational trade-offs of using beacon-based C2 in penetration
    testing versus beaconless alternatives: When does high stealth justify reduced interactivity, and how does this align
    with rules of engagement in authorized tests?'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing Tools\
  \ under Command and Control Infrastructure. Topic: Beacon Management Systems (software C2 beacons like Cobalt Strike/Empire,\
  \ NOT physical BLE devices—focus exclusively on ethical hacking context per voter consensus).\n\nTopic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity\
  \ > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing Tools > 001_Infrastructure and Environment Tools > Command\
  \ and Control Infrastructure > Beacon Management Systems.\n\nIncorporate these pedagogical elements:\n- Learning Objectives:\
  \ [insert full array from above]\n- Scaffolding Layers: [insert full array from above] (generate 20-30 flashcards balanced\
  \ across 4 layers: 5-8 per layer).\n- Active Learning Tie-Ins: Include 1-2 cards per 5 that prompt discussion/problem-solving\
  \ (e.g., 'Scenario for analysis: ...').\n- Ensure accuracy: Beacons are periodic 'phone-home' implants for post-exploitation;\
  \ cover features (jitter/sleep), profiles (Malleable C2), tools (Cobalt Strike, Empire, Covenant), evasion, OPSEC.\n\nGenerate\
