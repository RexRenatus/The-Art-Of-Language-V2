active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast configuration drift in production environments versus pentest lab environments.
    How can tools like Ansible or Puppet prevent exploits commonly found in misconfigured systems (e.g., open ports or weak
    services)? Debate using examples from NIST SP 800-128 and CIS Control 5, considering real-world pentest scenarios.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse Ansible's agentless nature with Puppet's
      agent-based; mix IaC with manual config; misstate CIS Control numbers).
    - Ensure distractors are 70% similar to correct answer (e.g., swap tool names, invert pros/cons).
    - Avoid obvious wrongs; make them test nuance (e.g., for APPLY level, distractors show incorrect syntax).
    coverage: 'Balance: 30% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 30% APPLY/ANALYZE, 40% EVALUATE/CREATE. Cover all tools, CIS/NIST, layers.'

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following this EXACT schema:

  For each card (numbered 1-25):

  **Front:**

  [Question]?

  A) [Distractor]

  B) [Distractor]

  C) [Correct]

  D) [Distractor]


  **Back:**

  **Correct Answer:** C) [Full text]

  **Explanation:** [1-2 sentences why correct, tie to objective/layer]

  **Detailed Rationale:** [Address misconceptions, reference NIST/CIS/tools]

  **Bloom''s Level & Layer:** [e.g., APPLY - Layer 3]

  **Active Learning Link:** [e.g., ''Relates to problem-solving exercise'']


  Distractors: Strictly follow protocol - plausible, misconception-based. Cover all objectives/layers/tools evenly. Ensure
  university-level rigor, active recall, spaced repetition friendly. Voter consensus: Emphasize completeness on tools/CIS,
  pedagogy via Bloom''s/scaffolding.'
