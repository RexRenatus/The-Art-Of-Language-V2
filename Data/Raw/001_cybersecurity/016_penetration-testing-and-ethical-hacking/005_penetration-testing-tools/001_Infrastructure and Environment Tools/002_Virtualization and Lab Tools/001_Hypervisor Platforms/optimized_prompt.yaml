active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare Type 1 and Type 2 hypervisors for use in a penetration testing lab. Discuss security trade-offs,
    such as VM escape risks, and debate which is best for isolating vulnerable target machines from the host. Address common
    misconceptions like 'Type 1 is always more secure.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    1/2 security), 2) Partial truths (e.g., ''VMware Workstation is Type 1'' – no, Type 2), 3) Edge cases (e.g., Proxmox pros
    but ignore cons), 4) Irrelevant details (e.g., mixing with containerization). Ensure distractors test deeper understanding.'
