active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of penetration testing labs, discuss the trade-offs between fully automated lab setups
    (e.g., using Terraform or Ansible) and manual configurations. How does automation impact learning outcomes, security posture,
    and reproducibility? Reference standards like NIST SP 800-115 or PTES, and address misconceptions such as 'automation
    eliminates the need for deep understanding.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
