  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the scenario: ''A penetration tester is exploiting a vulnerable web application
    VM that has been compromised and altered. Should they use a snapshot revert, a full clone, or a fresh VM import? Justify
    your choice based on time, storage, and repeatability factors, citing real-world pentesting constraints.'' Encourage critical
    thinking by requiring evidence from tool documentation.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Distractors must be plausible: e.g., common misconceptions (snapshots capture host OS), tool confusions (VMware term
      for VirtualBox feature), or edge cases (full clone mistaken for snapshot).'
    - Avoid 'never wrong' or obvious errors; base on real pitfalls from docs (e.g., 'merges all snapshots' vs. 'consolidates
      to base').
    - 'Vary: 1 semantic (close meaning), 1 syntactic (similar wording), 1 unrelated but themed (e.g., backup vs. snapshot).'
    example:
      question: What is a primary benefit of VM snapshots in pentesting?
      correct: Quick revert to pre-exploit state without data loss.
      distractors:
      - Creates a full independent copy consuming double storage.
      - Backs up the host hypervisor configuration.
      - Automatically patches VM vulnerabilities.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and
  Ethical Hacking. Topic: ''Snapshot Management Tools'' under hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking
  > Penetration Testing Tools > 001_Infrastructure and Environment Tools > Virtualization and Lab Tools > Snapshot Management
  Tools. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on VM snapshot tools (VirtualBox, VMware Workstation/Player, KVM) for pentesting labs—e.g., resetting
  vulnerable VMs like VulnHub for repeatable exploits. IGNORE Elasticsearch; correct to virtualization context per voter consensus.
