    for legitimate software protection or harmful for malware evasion? Provide real-world examples from cybersecurity incidents
    and evaluate detection strategies.'

    Common errors (e.g., static vs. dynamic unpacking); 3) Voter-suggested gaps (e.g., archiver vs. exec packer confusion);
    4) Web research misconceptions (e.g., packers only for compression, ignoring obfuscation). Ensure 70% plausibility to
    challenge ANALYZE/EVALUATE levels.'

  under Malware Analysis (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing Tools
  > 014_Forensics and Analysis Tools > 007_Malware Analysis Tools > Packer/Unpacker Tools).


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Spaced Repetition using university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy, active
  learning, 4-layer scaffolding.


  **CONTENT CONTEXT (COMPLETE FROM VOTER CONSENSUS & RESEARCH):** Packers compress/obfuscate executables (legit: size/IP protection;
  malicious: evasion). Types: Archivers (ZIP/SFX), Exec Packers (UPX), Custom (ASPack: obfuscation/anti-analysis; PECompact:
  encryption). Unpackers: UPX -d (static), PEiD/Detect It Easy (detection), ImpRec (imports), OllyDbg/x64dbg (dynamic). Custom
  packers: advanced obfuscation (code morphing, anti-debug), evasion signatures. Integrate with IDA Pro.


  **LEARNING OBJECTIVES (COVER ALL):** [Insert the 6 objectives from above JSON].


  **ACTIVE LEARNING INTEGRATION:** Embed prompts linking to discussion (e.g., ''Evaluate ethical use?''), peer teaching (e.g.,
  ''Teach unpacking steps''), problem-solving (e.g., ''Unpack this scenario'').


  **SCAFFOLDED STRUCTURE (DISTRIBUTE 6-7 CARDS/LAYER):** [Insert the 4 scaffolding layers from above JSON].


  **FLASHCARD OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON ARRAY):** For each card: {"type": "mc|cloze|qa", "front": "...", "back": {"answer": "...",
  "explanation": "... (incl. Bloom level, layer, active learning tie-in, source)", "tags": ["#PackerUnpacker", "#Bloom-REMEMBER",
  "#Layer1"], "distractors": ["A", "B", "C"] (for MC)}}.


  **RULES:** Balance: 30% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 40% APPLY/ANALYZE, 30% EVALUATE/CREATE. Use distractor protocol. Ensure active
  recall (no full sentences on front). Ground in web research: Packers evade AV via obfuscation. Voter priorities: Complete
  custom packers, tools list, concept map cards. Output ONLY the JSON array of 25 flashcards.'
