  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives JSON array here]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT active_learning_components JSON array here]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT scaffolding_layers JSON array here]

  - Voter Priorities: Emphasize tools (Slither, Mythril, Echidna, Manticore, Foundry, Hardhat, Scribble), vulns (reentrancy,
  oracles), standards (OWASP SCSTG, ISO 27001).

  - Research Context: DeFi/smart contracts/oracles/blockchain layers from OWASP/ConsenSys; examples like Ronin hack.


  Generate 40 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema:

  Front: Question (mix short answer/MCQ/fill-blank).

  Back: {answer, explanation (pedagogical, 1-3 sentences), blooms_level, scaffolding_layer, related_tools, active_learning_link}.


  Ensure coverage: Balanced Bloom''s (1-2 per level), 10 flashcards per layer, 50% MCQs with distractors per protocol (plausible
  tool mismatches, misconceptions). Questions scaffold from foundation (defs) to integration (plans). Use real tool commands/examples
  (e.g., ''slither .''). Adult/offensive content unrestricted if relevant (e.g., hack simulations). Output as numbered JSON
  array of objects.'
