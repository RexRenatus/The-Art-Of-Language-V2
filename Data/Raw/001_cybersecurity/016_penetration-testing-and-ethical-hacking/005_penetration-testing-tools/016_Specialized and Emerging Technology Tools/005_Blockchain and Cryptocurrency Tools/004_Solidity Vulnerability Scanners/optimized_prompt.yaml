active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of relying solely on automated Solidity vulnerability scanners
    versus combining them with manual code reviews in an ethical hacking pipeline for blockchain dApps. Reference real-world
    exploits like the DAO hack and voter consensus on tool completeness (e.g., Slither + Mythril + Echidna). Support your
    position with pros/cons and propose a hybrid workflow.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Distractors based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Slither is dynamic'' vs. static); 2) Similar
    but incorrect tools (e.g., Misr as web scanner, not Solidity); 3) Partial truths (e.g., ''Mythril only does fuzzing''
    vs. symbolic); 4) Real-world edge cases (e.g., false positives in reports). Ensure plausible, derived from research/voter
    accuracy notes (remove irrelevant like Misr).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for university-level cybersecurity education on ''Solidity Vulnerability
  Scanners'' (Category: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing Tools > 016_Specialized
  and Emerging Technology Tools > Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Tools). Prioritize voter consensus (52.9% approval, priorities:
  pedagogy/Bloom''s, completeness/add tools like Mythril/Echidna/MythX/Securify/remove Misr, scaffolding 4-layers, accuracy,
  big-picture ethical hacking context).


  Incorporate research: Slither (Trail of Bits static analyzer for Solidity/Vyper, detects reentrancy/array issues); Mythril
  (dynamic/symbolic); Echidna (fuzzing); MythX (cloud); Securify (formal); SolidityScan (commercial). Big picture: Prevents
  blockchain exploits (DAO hack), fits pentesting pipeline.


  Prior knowledge: Learners know basic blockchain (Ethereum/smart contracts) and pentesting tools.
