active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, select one SCADA tool (e.g., Modbus-cli or snap7). One partner explains its function, supported
    protocols, and a use case; the other demos it in a virtual lab (e.g., using a Modbus simulator). Switch roles and peer-review
    accuracy.
  problem_solving: 'Using a provided GrassMarlin topology of a simulated SCADA network (PLC → HMI → RTU), perform a vulnerability
    assessment: (1) Map with GrassMarlin, (2) Enumerate with PLCScan, (3) Test protocols with Modbus-cli. Identify 3 risks
    and propose mitigations. Debrief as a class.'

    only for Modbus''). Ensure distractors test deeper understanding, not trivia.'

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet using university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (balance levels
  per objectives), active learning (embed discussion/peer/problem-solving hints), 4-layer scaffolding (tag each card with
  layer), and web-grounded content (NIST/OWASP, tools: GrassMarlin, PLCScan, Modbus-cli, snap7, Nmap ICS scripts, ModScan,
  ICS-Forensics).


  **Learning Objectives (span all levels):** [Insert full list from ''learning_objectives''].

  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** [Insert summaries from ''active_learning''].

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full descriptions from ''scaffolding''].

  **Key Content Expansion (from voters/research):** Emphasize tools'' purposes (e.g., GrassMarlin: passive topology mapping;
  PLCScan: Ethernet/IP PLC enum), protocols (Modbus, DNP3), use cases (pentesting recon), limitations (disruption risk). IT/OT
  diffs, Stuxnet, MITRE ICS.


  **Output Format:** JSON array of 50 flashcards. Strictly follow schema: { ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''type'':
  ''cloze|mcq|sa'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffold_layer'': ''1|2|3|4'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'':
  [...] (MCQ only), ''references'': [''nist.gov/ot-security''] }. 10 cards per Bloom level; 12-13 per layer. 40% MCQ (3-4
  options), 30% cloze, 30% SA. Distractors per protocol. Ensure active, recall-focused Qs (e.g., ''Apply: Command to scan
  PLC with ___?''). No duplicates; progressive difficulty.'
