  Topic: Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) Tools (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration
  Testing Tools > Post-005_007_Exploitation Tools > Lateral Movement Tools > Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) Tools). Use the
  provided learning objectives, active learning components, scaffolding layers (1-4), and flashcard schema to generate high-quality,
  pedagogical flashcards.


  INTEGRATE:

  - Bloom''s Taxonomy: Ensure flashcards map to objectives (label each).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute evenly across 4 layers.

  - Prerequisites: Link to Nmap/exploitation where relevant.

  - Completeness: Cover all tools (mstsc, xfreerdp/FreeRDP, rdesktop, RDCMan, Nmap rdp*, Hydra, CrackMapExec, Metasploit RDP,
  Rdpy, Crowbar, Medusa, rdpwrap). Include commands, examples, MITRE T1021.001, CIS risks, ethical warnings.

  - Active Learning Tie-in: Include prompts referencing discussions/exercises.


  Output 50 flashcards in JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'':
  [''A'', ''B'', ''C''], ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': 1, ''prerequisite_link'': ''...'', ''ethical_note'': ''...''}},
  ...]. Follow schema exactly. Use university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition, distractors for testing. Ensure
  ethical hacking focus: ''For authorized pentesting only.'''
