  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''DCSync attacks are more dangerous than Golden Ticket
    attacks because they exploit legitimate AD protocols.'' Provide evidence from AD replication mechanics, tool capabilities,
    and real-world breaches (e.g., SolarWinds). Each participant must cite one pro and one con, fostering critical thinking
    on attack trade-offs.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing Tools
  like DCSync Attack Tools (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing
  Tools > Post-005_007_Exploitation Tools > Active Directory Attack Tools > DCSync Attack Tools).


  **Content Summary (use this as source material, expanding with standard knowledge):** DCSync attacks exploit AD replication
  via MS-DRSR to impersonate DCs and extract NTLM hashes. Key concepts: Extended Rights (''Replicating Directory Changes''),
  ACL weaknesses. Tools: Mimikatz (lsadump::dcsync), Impacket (secretsdump.py), Rubeus (dcsync). Mitigations: ACL tightening,
  monitor Event ID 4662/528, tiered admin (MITRE T1003). Sources: cayosoft.com, cybergladius.com, fidelissecurity.com, tenable.com.


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Generate flashcards aligned to these Learning Objectives [insert list above], Scaffolding Layers
  [insert above], and Active Learning elements. Connect to prior knowledge (AD basics, NTLM). Use concept map for interconnections.


  **Output Format:** JSON array of flashcards, each with: {''id'': 1, ''type'': ''Q&A|MCQ|Cloze'', ''bloom_level'': ''Remember'',
  ''scaffold_layer'': 1, ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''hints'': [...], ''related_terms'':
  [...]}, ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'', ''opt3''] (for MCQ)}. Follow Flashcard Schema exactly [insert schema above].
  Ensure high-quality: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, distractors plausible. Generate 40 flashcards balanced across
  levels/layers.'
