active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a high-density urban environment with overlapping WiFi networks, debate the optimal hop rate (e.g.,
    1-5 hops/sec vs. 10+ hops/sec) for balancing broad spectrum awareness and capturing WPA handshakes. Reference trade-offs
    and justify with real-world pentest examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    plausibility to test deep understanding; avoid obvious wrongs.'

  **Context and Content (Complete Synthesis):** Incorporate this full, voter-approved, research-grounded content:

  - Big Picture: Essential recon in PTES wireless phase for spectrum awareness, enabling WiFi attack chain (recon → capture
  handshakes → deauth → crack → exploit).

  - Foundation: [Insert Layer 1 content]. Link to prior: WiFi basics (802.11, channels, beacons).

  - Components: [Insert Layer 2 content]. Hop rates: 1-3/sec rural/low-density; 4-8/sec urban/high-density for good compromise
  (sources: Aircrack-ng docs, Kismet wiki, Hak5 blogs).

  - Implementation: [Insert Layer 3 content]. Tools expanded: Airodump-ng (hops automatically or via list); Kismet (adaptive,
  config-driven); hcxdumptool (PCAP/Hashcat output); airmon-ng prep.

  - Integration: [Insert Layer 4 content]. Best practices: Prioritize common channels, monitor dwell time >100ms, script for
  efficiency.

  **Learning Objectives:** Strictly align cards to these 6 objectives: [Insert full learning_objectives array].


  **Scaffolding:** Distribute cards across 4 layers: [Insert scaffolding details].


  **Active Learning Hooks:** Infuse explanations with ties to activities (e.g., ''Discuss in peer teaching: ...'').


  **Output Format:** JSON array of objects, each: {''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''distractors'': [...] or null, ''type'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''references'': ''...''} }. Follow flashcard_schema
  exactly. Vary types: 40% MCQ (4 options), 30% cloze/command, 30% short answer/scenario. Ensure distractors per protocol.
  Make explanations pedagogical, with commands testable in labs (e.g., Kali Linux). No duplicates; cover all tools/objectives/layers.'
