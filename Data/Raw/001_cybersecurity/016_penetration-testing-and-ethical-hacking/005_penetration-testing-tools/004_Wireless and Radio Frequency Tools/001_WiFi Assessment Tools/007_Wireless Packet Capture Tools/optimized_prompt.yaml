  discussion_prompt: 'Debate: Which tool (Wireshark, Airgeddon, Aircrack-ng) is best for capturing PMKID in a real-world WiFi
    audit? Compare features, ease-of-use, limitations, and use case studies from penetration testing reports. Consider integration
    with Kali Linux and common errors like failing to enable monitor mode.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
