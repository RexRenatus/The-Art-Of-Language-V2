active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate why wireless networks remain a common weak point in organizational security
    (e.g., default credentials, rogue APs). Reference real-world examples like the 2018 SamSam ransomware attacks exploiting
    weak Wi-Fi and propose mitigation strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions:

    - Confuse active/passive modes (e.g., ''Passive sends ARP requests'').

    - Mix tools (e.g., attribute airodump-ng features to Kismet).

    - Technical errors (e.g., wrong interface like eth0 for wireless).

    - Overgeneralize (e.g., ''All tools require monitor mode'').

    Ensure distractors are 70% plausible to trained users, promoting analysis.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing Tools.
  Topic: Wireless Network Discovery Tools (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration
  Testing Tools > 010_Wireless and Radio Frequency Tools > WiFi Assessment Tools > Wireless Network Discovery Tools).


  Use this optimized pedagogy:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list above].

  - Active Learning: Incorporate elements into explanations (e.g., ''Discuss in peers: ...'').

  - Scaffolding: Generate 10-15 cards per layer (Foundation > Components > Implementation > Integration); tag each card with
  layer and Bloom''s level.

  - Schema: Mix 40% Q&A/Cloze, 40% MCQ (follow distractor protocol), 20% scenario. Front/Back format.


  Sources: Netdiscover (active/passive ARP), airodump-ng (Aircrack-ng monitor), Kismet (passive sniffer/wardriving/IDS). Context:
  PTES recon, wireless vulns (IoT, rogue APs).


  Output JSON array of flashcards: [{''type'': ''MCQ|Q&A|Cloze|Scenario'', ''layer'': ''1-4'', ''bloom'': ''REMEMBER-etc'',
  ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'', ''opt3'']}},
  ...]. Generate 40 high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized cards spanning all objectives.'
