        "core_logic": "SS7MAPer is designed for MAP protocol testing because MAP is a critical component of SS7 responsible for mobile subscriber management, and its security is paramount for preventing location tracking and interception.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly link SS7MAPer to air interface encryption, VoLTE vulnerabilities, or general SMS DoS attacks, rather than its specific focus on the MAP protocol within SS7.",
        "analogy": "If SS7 is the highway system, SS7MAPer is a specialized tool for inspecting the specific 'on-ramps' and 'off-ramps' (MAP protocol) that manage vehicle (subscriber) movement."
