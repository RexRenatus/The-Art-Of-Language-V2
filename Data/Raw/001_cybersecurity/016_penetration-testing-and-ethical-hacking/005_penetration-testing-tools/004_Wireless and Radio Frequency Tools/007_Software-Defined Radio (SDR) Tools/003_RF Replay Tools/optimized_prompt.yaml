  Topic: RF Replay Tools (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing Tools >
  010_Wireless and Radio Frequency Tools > Software-Defined Radio (SDR) Tools > RF Replay Tools). Voter consensus: 82.9% approval
  emphasizing completeness (HackRF One, Yard Stick One, URH, GNU Radio, standards like PTES/NIST SP 800-115/OWASP IoT), pedagogy
  (Bloom''s progression), scaffolding.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Inspire critical thinking via discussions, peer teaching, problem-solving on ethics/real-world (car key
  fobs, garage doors).

  - Scaffolding: Strictly layer content (Foundation > Components > Implementation > Integration).

  - Prerequisites: RF basics, SDR intro, pen testing methodology.

  - Big Picture: RF Replay for wireless/IoT vuln testing; capture/analyze/replay signals.

  - Best Practices: Ethical use, signal integrity.

  - Sources: PTES docs, NIST SP 800-115, OWASP IoT, tool repos (Great Scott Gadgets, URH GitHub).


  Generate 50 flashcards in JSON array. Follow EXACT schema:

  [EXAMPLE: {"front": "What is RF Replay?", "back": "Capturing and retransmitting RF signals to test wireless security.",
  "type": "Q&A", "bloom_level": "Remember", "scaffolding_layer": 1, "distractors": [], "explanation": "Links to SDR flexibility...",
  "source_context": "Core concept from research."}]


  Distractors only for MCQs (3 per, per protocol). Ensure university-level: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, no
  hints on front. Distribute: 10 Layer1/Remember-Understand, 15 Layer2/Analyze, 15 Layer3/Apply, 10 Layer4/Evaluate-Create.
  Varied types for engagement.'
