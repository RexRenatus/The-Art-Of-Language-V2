active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical implications and risks of using black-box Joomla scanners like
    JoomScan during reconnaissance versus full disclosure in a real-world pentest engagement. Support arguments with OWASP
    Top 10 references and tool limitations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    with Nikto), 1 from related but incorrect tools (e.g., WPScan for Joomla), 1 from tool limitations/false positives (e.g.,
    outdated version detection). Ensure distractors are web-research grounded and promote critical thinking.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing Tools.\
  \ Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on 'Joomla Vulnerability Tools' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing\
  \ And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing Tools > 004_Web Application Testing Tools > CMS-Specific Testing Tools > Joomla\
  \ Vulnerability Tools).\n\nIncorporate these elements:\n- Learning Objectives: [Insert full list from learning_objectives\
  \ above].\n- Active Learning: Tie flashcards to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving (e.g., 'Apply in peer teaching:\
  \ ...').\n- Scaffolding: Distribute evenly across 4 layers (12-13 per layer): Layer 1 Foundation, Layer 2 Components (tools:\
  \ JoomScan, CMSmap, OWASP ZAP Joomla plugins; features, diagrams), Layer 3 Implementation (tutorials, examples), Layer 4\
  \ Integration (pentest workflows, OWASP Top 10).\n- Prior Knowledge: Link to web scanners (Nikto, ZAP), pentesting phases,\
  \ CMS basics.\n- Research Context: Joomla CMS; tools detect versions/extensions/vulns; black-box enum; standards: OWASP\
  \ Top 10 (e.g., Vulnerable Components). Sources: OWASP Joomla (https://owasp.org/www-project-joomscan/), JoomScan GitHub\
  \ (https://github.com/OWASP/joomscan), CMSmap (https://github.com/Dionach/CMSmap), OWASP Top 10 (https://owasp.org/Top10/).\n\
  \nOutput Format (JSON array of flashcards):\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"type\": \"Multiple Choice|Basic Q&A|Scenario\"\

  : \"Answer + Explanation (incl. why distractors wrong if MCQ) + Active Learning Tie-in + Source\",\n    \"tags\": [\"JoomScan\"\
  , \"enumeration\", etc.]\n  }\n]\n\nEnsure variety: 40% MCQ (with distractor protocol), 30% Q&A, 30% scenarios. Make questions\
  \ progressively harder per Bloom's/scaffolding. Promote active recall, no hints on front."
