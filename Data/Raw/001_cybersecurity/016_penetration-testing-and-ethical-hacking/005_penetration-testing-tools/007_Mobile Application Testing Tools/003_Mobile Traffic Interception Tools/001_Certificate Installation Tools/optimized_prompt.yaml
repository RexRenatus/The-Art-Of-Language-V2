active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between ease of certificate installation (e.g., user-trusted
    CAs on Android) and security risks (e.g., potential for persistent MITM attacks post-testing). Reference NIST SP 800-52
    and real-world pen testing scenarios to support your arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing Tools.
  Topic: Certificate Installation Tools (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration
  Testing Tools > 011_Mobile Application Testing Tools > Mobile Traffic Interception Tools > Certificate Installation Tools).
  Focus on mobile traffic interception using custom CA certs (Burp Suite Portable CA, mitmproxy, Frida/Objection, ADB, Magisk,
  Apple Configurator), Android/iOS/emulators, NIST SP 800-52 TLS guidelines, and standards like CA/Browser Forum.


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list from ''learning_objectives'']

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving where relevant.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute across 4 layers: [Insert summaries from ''scaffolding''].


  Generate flashcards following this exact schema:

  [Insert full ''flashcard_schema'' details].


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 75 flashcards, each as an object matching the schema. Ensure completeness with specific examples
  (e.g., ADB commands: ''adb push burp.crt /sdcard/''), research-grounded (NIST SP 800-52: requires proper chain validation),
  and progression from remember to create. Sources: PortSwigger (Burp docs), mitmproxy.org, Frida.re, NIST.gov/sp800-52r2.pdf,
