  discussion_prompt: 'In an authorized penetration testing scenario, debate the ethical trade-offs of using root detection
    bypass tools: When is it justified to bypass root detection on a client''s device? How does this align with OWASP MASTG
    and legal standards like those in the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)? Support your position with real-world examples
    from pentest reports.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Option A: Correct answer.

    - Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., ''Frida requires recompiling APK'' vs. runtime hooking).

    - Distractor 2: Related but incorrect (e.g., ''Magisk Hide modifies /system'' vs. systemless).

    - Distractor 3: Plausible wrong tool/method (e.g., ''Use ADB root'' vs. Frida script).

    Ensure distractors are web-grounded (e.g., from root detection blogs) and promote analysis.'
