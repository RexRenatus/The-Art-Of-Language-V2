active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of using Android Emulators versus physical devices in penetration testing. When
    do emulators fail security tests (e.g., emulator detection by apps, inaccurate hardware sensors)? Provide real-world examples
    from OWASP MASTG and justify scenarios where one is preferable.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1 common misconception (e.g., ''Emulators perfectly mimic sensors'' vs. ''They
      lack real hardware''), 1 related but incorrect term (e.g., ''ADB'' vs. ''AVD Manager''), 1 edge case (e.g., ''Physical
      device only'' vs. ''Emulator'').'
    - 'Base on voter priorities: Include distractors testing emulator vs. real device trade-offs, incomplete best practices
      (e.g., no snapshots).'
    - Ensure distractors promote analysis/evaluation (e.g., security risks).
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing Tools.
  Generate 50 high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards on ''Android Emulators'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration
  Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing Tools > 011_Mobile Application Testing Tools > Android Testing Tools >
  Android Emulators). Integrate university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives, active learning, 4-layer scaffolding, prior
  knowledge (Android Studio/ADB).


  **Content Scope:** Core concepts (Emulator, AVD), role in pen testing (OWASP MASTG), setup, comparisons (vs real devices),
  best practices (rooting/Magisk, snapshots, network bridging, Frida/Burp/ADB integration, security isolation). Big picture:
  Scalable mobile pen testing.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the full ''learning_objectives'' array here].


  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Reference in explanations: [Insert summaries of discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving].


  **Scaffolding:** Distribute cards: 30% Layer 1/2 (foundation/components), 40% Layer 3 (implementation), 30% Layer 4 (integration/best
  practices).


  **Output Format (JSON array of flashcards):** Each flashcard: {''type'': ''basic|mcq|cloze'', ''front'': string, ''back'':
  string, ''blooms_level'': ''Remember|etc.'', ''layer'': 1-4, ''tags'': [''android-emulators'', ''pentest'', ''avd'']}. Follow
  schema exactly.


  **Flashcard Schema & Distractors:** [Insert full ''flashcard_schema'' here]. Generate varied types (20 basic, 20 MCQ, 10
  cloze). Ensure measurable, active recall. Sources: developer.android.com, OWASP MASTG.


  Output ONLY the JSON array of 50 flashcards. No extra text.'
