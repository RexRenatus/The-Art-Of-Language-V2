active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the scenarios where stacked queries are preferable over union-based SQLi
    in penetration testing (e.g., data exfiltration vs. command execution). Consider DBMS limitations and ethical implications—what
    risks do they pose if misused?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    distractor1: Semantically similar but incorrect (e.g., confuses with union-based syntax).
    distractor2: Common misconception (e.g., assumes all DBMS support stacked queries).
    distractor3: Unrelated or opposite (e.g., mitigation confused as technique).
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and\
  \ Ethical Hacking. Topic: 'Stacked Query Tools' (stacked SQL queries for database exploitation, e.g., multiple statements\
  \ via ';' in SQLi using tools like sqlmap).\n\nTopic Hierarchy:\n- Level 1: Cybersecurity\n- Level 2: Penetration Testing\
  \ And Ethical Hacking\n- Level 3: Penetration Testing Tools\n- Level 4: 012_Database Assessment Tools\n- Level 5: Database\
  \ 005_007_Exploitation Tools\n- Level 6: Stacked Query Tools\n\nIncorporate these pedagogical elements:\n- Learning Objectives:\
  \ [PASTE FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]\n- Scaffolding Layers: [PASTE FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM ABOVE]\n- Active Learning: Design flashcards\
  \ that support discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving (e.g., scenario-based Qs).\n- Bloom's Coverage: Distribute across\
