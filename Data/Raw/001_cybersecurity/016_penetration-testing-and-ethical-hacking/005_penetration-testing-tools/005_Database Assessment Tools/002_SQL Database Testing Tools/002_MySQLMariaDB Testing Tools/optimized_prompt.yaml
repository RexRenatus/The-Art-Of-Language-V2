active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of relying on automated tools like sqlmap versus manual
    SQLi payloads for MySQL/MariaDB testing in high-security environments. Consider factors like detection accuracy, stealth,
    and adaptability to custom evasions, referencing OWASP guidelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
