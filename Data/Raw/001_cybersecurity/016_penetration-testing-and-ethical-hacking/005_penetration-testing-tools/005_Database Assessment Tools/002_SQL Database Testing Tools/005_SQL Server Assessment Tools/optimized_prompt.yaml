active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the balance between defensive tools like SQL Vulnerability Assessment and
    offensive tools like SQLMap in ethical penetration testing. Consider scenarios where one might outperform the other in
    database enumeration and exploitation phases of the pentest lifecycle.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    version limitation). Ensure distractors promote analysis.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing Tools.
  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on ''SQL Server Assessment Tools'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing
  And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing Tools > 012_Database Assessment Tools > SQL Database Testing Tools > SQL Server
  Assessment Tools). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (span all levels per objectives), active learning (inspired
  by provided activities), 4-layer scaffolding (build progressively), spaced repetition best practices (active recall, no
  hints on front).


  Incorporate research context: SQL Assessment API (configs, JSON rules, GitHub, PowerShell Invoke-SqlAssessment, supports
  SQL 2012+ incl. Azure); SQL Vulnerability Assessment (VA: vulns, remediation, Defender integration); CIS Benchmarks (hardening);
  complete ADS: Azure Data Studio extension for API-based assessments via notebooks/PowerShell; offensive: SQLMap for SQLi
  in ethical hacking.
