  discussion_prompt: In an internal penetration test, when should testers stop exploitation attempts to avoid real damage?
    Debate using real-world breach examples (e.g., EternalBlue in WannaCry) and reference PTES guidelines on scope adherence.
  peer_teaching: 'Students pair up: One explains an exploit technique for an internal service (e.g., SMB EternalBlue or outdated
    Apache vuln using Metasploit); the partner teaches back effective countermeasures (e.g., patching, network segmentation).
    Switch roles and discuss stealth techniques.'
  problem_solving: 'Given a vulnerable internal service scenario (e.g., outdated Apache on an internal network in Metasploitable
    VM), design a safe exploitation plan: Select vuln, craft exploit, execute with Metasploit, evade IPS/IDS, and outline
    post-exploitation pivoting. Test in a lab and report findings.'
