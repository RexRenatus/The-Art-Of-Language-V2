active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the pros and cons of implementing DNSSEC in external DNS setups, referencing RFC 9364 for complexities
    like key management and performance overhead. Consider trade-offs in a real-world penetration testing scenario.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains subdomain takeover using an OWASP Web Security Testing Guide example (e.g.,
    dangling CNAME to inactive AWS S3 bucket), while the other teaches back the role of NXDOMAIN responses in identifying
    non-existent subdomains. Switch roles and discuss mitigations.
  problem_solving: Given a mock DNS zone file (e.g., example.com with CNAME records pointing to expired services), identify
    takeover risks, propose fixes (e.g., delete dangling records or implement DNSSEC), and simulate an attacker workflow using
    tools like dig.
