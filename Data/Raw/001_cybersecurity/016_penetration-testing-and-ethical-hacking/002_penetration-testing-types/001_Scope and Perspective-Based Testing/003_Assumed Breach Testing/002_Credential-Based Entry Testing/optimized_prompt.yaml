active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical implications and defensive countermeasures for Credential-Based
    Entry Testing in an enterprise Active Directory environment. How does it expose gaps that traditional perimeter testing
    misses? Support with examples from recent breaches like SolarWinds or Colonial Pipeline.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol:
    rules: 'Generate 3-4 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions: 1) Confuse with external recon/phishing
      (e.g., ''Involves sending fake emails''); 2) Mix with other pentest types (e.g., ''Same as black-box testing''); 3)
      Tool errors (e.g., ''Uses Nmap for credential spraying''); 4) Overgeneralize (e.g., ''Always requires physical access'').
      Ensure distractors are realistic from voter-noted gaps or web sources like OWASP credential stuffing docs.'
    quality_check: Distractors must be 70% plausible to educated learners but incorrect; avoid obvious wrongs.

  **Research Context (Complete Synthesis from Sources like MITRE ATT&CK T1078, PTES, SANS FOR578, OWASP):** Credential-Based
  Entry Testing is a targeted penetration testing method where testers use valid credentials (stolen via stuffing/dumping,
  guessed, or provided) to gain initial post-perimeter access, simulating attackers with compromised accounts. Key in Assumed
  Breach: assumes breach occurred, tests internal defenses. Methods: Password spraying (low attempts/user), stuffing (breached
  pwds). Tools: CrackMapExec, Hydra, Mimikatz, BloodHound. Steps: Acquire creds > Authenticate > Enumerate > Escalate > Report.
  Examples: Using service account creds for lateral movement in AD. Differs from black-box (no creds) or full Red Team (broader).
  Defenses: MFA, monitoring anomalies.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full array from above].

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full array from above].

  **Active Learning:** Incorporate concepts for review (e.g., cards prompting discussion scenarios).


  Generate flashcards per schema: Variety (MCQ 60%, cloze/short 20%, scenario 20%). Cover all objectives/layers evenly. Use
  distractor protocol strictly. Output ONLY valid JSON array matching exact schema. Ensure university-level accuracy, active
  recall, spaced repetition friendly (concise fronts, explanatory backs).'
