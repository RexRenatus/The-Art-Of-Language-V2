active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given limited resources, should organizations always prioritize CISA KEV catalog vulnerabilities over
    others? Debate pros/cons with real-world cases like Log4Shell vs. niche CVEs, considering exploitability, impact, and
    patch reliability.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
  additional_activities:
  - 'Role-playing pentest debrief: Students present patch gaps to ''executives'' (peers).'
  - Think-pair-share on misconceptions (e.g., 'Latest patch = always secure' – discuss zero-days).
  - 'Group design challenge: Create a patch policy for a hospital network balancing uptime and security.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 20-30 high-quality flashcards
  on ''Patch Level Assessment'' using the provided topic hierarchy, research context, learning objectives, scaffolding layers,
  active learning elements, and flashcard schema.


  Incorporate university pedagogy: Map flashcards to Bloom''s levels and scaffolding layers. Ensure active learning tie-ins
  (e.g., questions on prioritization debates, lifecycle pitfalls).


  Use only the given research context and sources for accuracy. Prioritize voter consensus: 82.9% approval.
