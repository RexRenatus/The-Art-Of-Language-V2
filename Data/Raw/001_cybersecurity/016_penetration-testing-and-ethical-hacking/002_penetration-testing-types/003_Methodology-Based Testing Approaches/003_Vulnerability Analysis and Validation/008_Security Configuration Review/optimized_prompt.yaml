active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the prioritization of CIS Controls (e.g., Inventory and Control of Hardware
    Assets vs. Secure Configuration for Hardware) in a resource-constrained organization. How does this impact security configuration
    reviews during penetration testing? Cite examples from real-world breaches.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
