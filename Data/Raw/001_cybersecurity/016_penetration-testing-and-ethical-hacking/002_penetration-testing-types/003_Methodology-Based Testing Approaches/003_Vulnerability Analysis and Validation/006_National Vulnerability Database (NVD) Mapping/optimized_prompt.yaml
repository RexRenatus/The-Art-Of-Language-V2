active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a penetration test, how might over-reliance on NVD CVSS scores lead to misprioritization of vulnerabilities?
    Debate with examples from recent CVEs (e.g., Log4Shell CVE-2021-44228), considering factors like business impact, exploit
    maturity, and environmental constraints.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Plausible misconceptions (e.g., 'CVSS v4 removes base score' → distractor).
    - Partial truths (e.g., correct for v3 but wrong for v4).
    - Common errors (e.g., confuse CPE with CCE; overstate CVSS as absolute).
    - Outdated info (e.g., CVSS v2 metrics).
    - Irrelevant but similar terms (e.g., CVSS vs. EPSS).
    quantity: Always 3 distractors for MCQs, labeled A-D with correct indicated.

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM JSON]

  - Active Learning: Weave in scenarios from discussion, peer teaching, and problem-solving.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute across 4 layers [PASTE FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM JSON].

  - Prioritize completeness: Fully define/explain CPE (Common Platform Enumeration for product matching), sources (NIST NVD),
  NVD Mapping (pentesting process correlating scans to NVD via CVE/CWE/CPE/CVSS).


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly [PASTE FULL SCHEMA FROM JSON]. Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'':
  {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...''}}, ...]. Ensure
  distractors follow protocol. Balance coverage. Use precise, professional language with NIST-grounded accuracy.'
