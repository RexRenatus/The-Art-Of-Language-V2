  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Automated Vulnerability Assessment can fully replace
    manual penetration testing.'' Support your position with examples of tools like Nessus/OpenVAS, common false positives,
    and references to ISO 27001 vulnerability management requirements. Identify 2-3 student misconceptions (e.g., AVA finds
    business logic flaws) and counter them with evidence.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing. Topic:
  Automated Vulnerability Assessment (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing
  Types > 003_Methodology-Based Testing Approaches > Vulnerability Analysis and Validation > Automated Vulnerability Assessment).
  Use the provided learning_objectives, active_learning components, scaffolding layers, and flashcard_schema to generate high-quality,
  pedagogically optimized flashcards.


  Incorporate voter consensus: Tools (Nessus, OpenVAS, Nmap NSE, Qualys); Databases (CVE/NVD/CVSS); Scans (network/web/host);
  Steps (scope/tool/scan/analyze/report); Standards (ISO 27001 A.12.6 vuln mgmt); Misconceptions (AVA detects all/no false
  positives/business logic); Labs (Metasploitable/DVWA); Measurable outcomes; Concept map (AVA in vuln cycle/pentesting phases).


  Research context: AVA uses tools to scan for known vulns vs. databases; Part of vuln mgmt cycle (OWASP/NIST); Sources: OWASP.org,
  nvd.nist.gov, cve.mitre.org, tenable.com/nessus, greenbone.net/openvas, ISO 27001:2022.


  Generate 75 flashcards strictly following flashcard_schema. Balance: 25% Layer1/REMEMBER-UNDERSTAND; 25% Layer2/APPLY; 25%
  Layer3/ANALYZE; 25% Layer4/EVALUATE-CREATE. Embed active learning (e.g., ''Apply in Metasploitable lab''). Output as JSON
  array of flashcard objects. Ensure university-level rigor, no criminal advice.'
