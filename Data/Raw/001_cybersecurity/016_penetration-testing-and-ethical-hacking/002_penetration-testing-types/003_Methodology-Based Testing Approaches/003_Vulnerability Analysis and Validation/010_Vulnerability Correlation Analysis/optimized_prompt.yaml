active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate whether CVSS scores alone are sufficient for risk prioritization or if vulnerability correlation
    is essential. Use real-world examples like chaining Heartbleed (CVE-2014-0160) with a shellshock vulnerability to argue
    positions, considering organizational context.
  peer_teaching: 'In pairs: Student A describes a vulnerability chain from a penetration test report (e.g., low-severity auth
    bypass + high-severity priv esc); Student B teaches it back using hand-drawn diagrams or digital tools like Draw.io, then
    switch roles.'
  problem_solving: Given a simulated Nessus scan report with 10 vulnerabilities (provide sample data including CVEs, CVSS
    scores, and affected services), groups correlate them into 2-3 attack paths, score correlated risks, visualize with attack
    graphs, and propose prioritized mitigations. Debrief as a class.

    perfectly''), 2) Partial truth (e.g., ''Only high CVSS vulns chain''), 3) Unrelated/confused term (e.g., mix CVSS with
    CWE). Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter-noted pitfalls like ignoring low-CVSS enablers.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and
  Ethical Hacking. Topic: Vulnerability Correlation Analysis (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking
