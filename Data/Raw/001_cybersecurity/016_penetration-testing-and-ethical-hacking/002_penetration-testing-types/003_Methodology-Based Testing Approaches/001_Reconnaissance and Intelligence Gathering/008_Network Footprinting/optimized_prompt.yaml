active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical and legal implications of using active footprinting on a public
    website versus passive OSINT gathering from social media. Support your position with examples from real-world penetration
    testing scenarios and consider detection risks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    truth (e.g., correct tool but wrong flag), (3) Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Always undetectable''). Ensure plausible
    for intermediate learners; base on voter/research pitfalls like tool misuse or risk underestimation.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing. Topic:
  Network Footprinting (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing Types > 003_Methodology-Based
  Testing Approaches > Reconnaissance and Intelligence Gathering > Network Footprinting). Use provided research (passive/active
  types, tools: WHOIS/theHarvester/Shodan/Google dorking/Wireshark for passive; Nmap/traceroute for active; PTES/OSSTMM context)
  and voter priorities (completeness with tools/steps, Bloom''s full coverage, scaffolding).

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Tie cards to activities (e.g., ''For peer teaching'').

  - Scaffolding: Distribute across 4 layers.


  Generate 50 flashcards in JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'':
  [''d1 (why wrong)'', ''d2 (why wrong)'', ''d3 (why wrong)''], ''reference'': ''...'', ''active_element'': ''...''}}, ...].
  Follow exact schema. Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, distractors per protocol. Prioritize
  ethical hacking context, stealth, lifecycle integration.'
