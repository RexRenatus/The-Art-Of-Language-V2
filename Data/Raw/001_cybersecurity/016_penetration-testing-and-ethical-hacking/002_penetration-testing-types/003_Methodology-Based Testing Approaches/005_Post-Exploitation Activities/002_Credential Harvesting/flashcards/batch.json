        "core_logic": "Kerberoasting is a powerful technique because it targets service accounts that often have weaker passwords than user accounts. It works by requesting service tickets (TGS) for services running under user accounts and then cracking the NTLM hash of the service account offline, connecting to the Kerberos authentication flow.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors misidentify the target (DNS, krbtgt) or the method (phishing), failing to recognize that Kerberoasting specifically targets service accounts via Kerberos ticket requests for offline cracking.",
        "analogy": "Kerberoasting is like asking for a special pass to enter a specific room (service) and then trying to guess the janitor's (service account) key to that room, rather than trying to get the master key."
