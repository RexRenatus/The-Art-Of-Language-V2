        "core_logic": "The shared responsibility model is crucial because it defines the boundaries of security duties.

        "core_logic": "Storage buckets in GCP, such as Cloud Storage, are susceptible to misconfigurations (e.g., public access settings). Penetration testers look for these misconfigurations because they can lead to data breaches, exposing sensitive information to unauthorized parties.",
