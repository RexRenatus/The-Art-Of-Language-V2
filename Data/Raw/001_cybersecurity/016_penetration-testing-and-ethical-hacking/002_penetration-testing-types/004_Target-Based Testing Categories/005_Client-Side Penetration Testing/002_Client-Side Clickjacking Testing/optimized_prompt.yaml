  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains the mechanics of a clickjacking attack using a simple HTML/CSS/JS demo (e.g.,
    an invisible iframe overlaying a fake button). The partner tests it in their browser, asks clarifying questions, and verifies
    if mitigations like X-Frame-Options block it. Then switch roles.
  problem_solving: 'Provide students with a vulnerable web app (e.g., local setup via DVWA or an online sandbox like HackTheBox).
    Task: Design and execute a clickjacking PoC targeting a sensitive action (e.g., ''transfer funds'' button), test mitigations
    by adding headers, and report findings with severity scoring. Real-world application: Simulate testing a banking site
    login form.'

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in penetration testing. Topic:\
  \ Client-Side Clickjacking Testing (Category: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing\
  \ Types > 004_Target-Based Testing Categories > Client-Side Penetration Testing > Client-Side Clickjacking Testing). Use\
  \ this research context: Clickjacking (UI redressing) tricks users via invisible iframes/CSS overlays to perform unintended\
  \ actions on legitimate sites, bypassing CSRF if authenticated. OWASP WSTG-CLNT-09 testing: Check headers (X-Frame-Options:\
  \ DENY/SAMEORIGIN, CSP frame-ancestors), craft PoC with embedded iframe and overlay. Impacts: data theft, account takeover.\
  \ Mitigations: headers, JS frame-busting.\n\nIncorporate these pedagogical elements:\n- Learning Objectives: [paste the\
  \ learning_objectives array here]\n- Scaffolding Layers: [paste the scaffolding object here]\n- Active Learning: Design\
  \ flashcards that support discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving (e.g., scenario-based Qs for debate).\n\nGenerate exactly\
  \ 30 flashcards following this schema: [paste the flashcard_schema here]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 30 flashcard objects,\
