active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the relative security risks of 2-tier versus 3-tier thick client architectures, using real-world
    examples like past breaches in desktop applications (e.g., Skype vulnerabilities). Support arguments with attack surfaces
    such as local storage and proprietary protocols.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., confusing thick with thin
      clients). 2) Partial truths (e.g., HTTP-only for comm channels). 3) Related but incorrect concepts (e.g., web app tools
      for thick clients). Ensure one is highly plausible ''trap'' answer. No obvious wrongs.'
    count: Always 4 options total (1 correct + 3 distractors), randomized position for correct answer.

  Incorporate this comprehensive research context:

  - Thick Client: Local processing app (e.g., Outlook, Teams) vs. Thin Client (server-heavy). Attack surface: local files/registry/memory,
  multiple comm channels (TCP/UDP sockets, named pipes, RPC, proprietary/custom binaries; beyond HTTP).

  - Architectures: 2-Tier (Client UI + DB), 3-Tier (Client UI + App Logic Server + DB).

  - Pentesting: Binary analysis, decompilation (dnSpy), runtime hooking (Frida), process monitoring (ProcMon), traffic capture
  (Wireshark). Vulns: Insecure deserialization, hardcoded creds.

  - Sources: OWASP Testing Guide v4 (Client-Side), SANS Reading Room ''Pentesting Thick Clients'', PayloadsAllTheThings/Thick-Client.
