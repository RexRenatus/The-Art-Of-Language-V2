active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the real-world implications of token leakage in APIs (e.g., via URLs or
    logs) and how it relates to OWASP API Top 10 Broken Authentication. Propose mitigation strategies and evaluate their effectiveness
    against replay attacks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these EXACT elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL 4 LAYERS FROM ABOVE], ensuring flashcards progress logically with recaps.

  - Research: Core concepts (API, Token, JWT, Auth/Authz, REST), OWASP API Top 10 (Broken Auth), NCSC guidance (secure issuance/transmission/revocation,
  no exposure), vulns (leakage, alg=none, replay), tools (Burp Suite, jwt.io), standards (RFC 7519).


  Generate 40-50 flashcards following this EXACT SCHEMA: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD_SCHEMA FROM ABOVE].


  Ensure:

  - Coverage: Evenly across Bloom''s levels/objectives and 4 layers.

  - High-quality: University pedagogy (active recall, spaced repetition), plausible distractors.

  - Output format: JSON array of objects, each: {''front'': ''Question + options'', ''back'': {''correct_answer'': ''...'',
  ''distractors'': {''A'': ''...'', ''B'': ''...'', ''C'': ''...''}, ''tags'': {...}, ''active_link'': ''...'' } }.


  Prioritize pentesting techniques: enumeration, leakage tests, validation. Link to prerequisites. Make engaging for ethical
  hacking learners.'
