active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Which OWASP API Security Top 10 vulnerability do you think poses the greatest risk to REST APIs in real-world
    applications like mobile banking apps, and why? Provide evidence from recent breaches (e.g., cite examples like the Capital
    One breach involving SSRF or similar API exploits).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (2) Similar but incorrect concept (e.g., SQLi for injection vs. API-specific); (3) Edge case or outdated term (e.g., SOAP
    risk for REST). Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter/research errors, not obvious wrongs.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert educational flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity, particularly Penetration
  Testing and Ethical Hacking. Generate 50 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''REST 006: API Security Assessment'' (Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing Types > 004_Target-Based Testing Categories
  > API Penetration Testing > REST 006_API Security Assessment). Voter consensus (82.9% approval): Emphasize completeness
  of OWASP API Security Top 10 (full list with briefs in scaffolding), Bloom''s progression, active learning, and 4-layer
  scaffolding.


  Incorporate research context: REST (stateless, HTTP methods/URIs/headers/status codes), API Security, Pen Testing (endpoints/auth/data).
  Other tech: SOAP, GraphQL, gRPC.


  Learning Objectives: [Insert full list from above].

  Active Learning (inspire card scenarios): [Insert full active_learning from above].

  Scaffolding Layers (distribute ~12-13 cards per layer): [Insert full scaffolding from above].


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: [Insert full flashcard_schema from above]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 50 unique flashcards,
  balanced (20% per Bloom''s level, 25% per layer, mix types). Ensure completeness: Every OWASP risk covered multiple times
  across cards. Use concept map dependencies (e.g., auth → authorization). No duplicates; optimize for Anki/Quizlet import.
  High pedagogy: Scaffold from foundation to integration, promote active recall.'
