  discussion_prompt: In modern web frameworks with built-in path sanitization, is directory traversal still a significant
    threat? Debate with evidence from recent CVEs, considering evasion techniques and real-world impacts.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Research context: Directory traversal (path traversal) allows access outside web root via ../ payloads due to poor input
  validation. Key: OWASP WSTG-ATHZ-01 for testing; vectors like file params; mitigations: sanitization, ACLs. Sources: OWASP
  Web Security Testing Guide (https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/), PortSwigger Burp Suite docs.


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"id":1, "type":"multiple_choice|basic|cloze", "front":"...", "back":"...",
  "blooms_level":"REMEMBER", "layer":"1", "explanation":"Detailed rationale + why distractors wrong if MCQ + active learning
  tie-in", "source":"OWASP"}. Follow flashcard_schema exactly: mix types, distractor_protocol, coverage across objectives/layers.
  Ensure active recall, spaced repetition friendly (concise fronts, explanatory backs). No extra text.'
