active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the critical role of database backup security assessments within the larger
    penetration testing framework. How does it address overlooked vectors like ransomware data destruction, and what real-world
    breach examples (e.g., from recent attacks) highlight its importance? Connect to the 'big picture' of target-based testing
    in ethical hacking.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Backups are always immutable'' vs.
    reality), 2) Related but incorrect term (e.g., ''NIST CP-9'' vs. ''AC-3''), 3) Partial truth (e.g., ''Encryption only
    at rest'' omitting transit). Base on real-world errors from breaches or standards misapplications. Ensure plausibility
    for active learning discussions.'
