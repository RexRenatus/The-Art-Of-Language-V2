active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between comprehensive audit logging (e.g., unified auditing
    in Oracle) and performance impacts in a production database during a penetration test. How can pentesters use log review
    to validate evasion techniques like living-off-the-land?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Use this research context: Database audit logs track events (who, what, when) for incident detection. Key concepts: Auditing,
  Audit Trail, Unified Auditing (Oracle), Audit Policy. Best practices (completed): Oracle (predefined/custom UNIFIED_AUDIT_POLICY:
  e.g., CREATE AUDIT POLICY logins ACTIONS LOGIN; SQL Server: CREATE SERVER AUDIT; PostgreSQL: SET log_statement=''all'';
  MySQL: SET global general_log=1). Pentest focus: Review for logged actions/evasion. Standards: CIS Control 8 (https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/audit-log-management),
  NIST SP 800-92, ISO 27001 Annex A.8.15. Big picture: Post-exploitation in pentest lifecycle.


  Generate flashcards per schema: [insert flashcard_schema here]. Output as JSON array of objects, each with ''front'', ''back''
