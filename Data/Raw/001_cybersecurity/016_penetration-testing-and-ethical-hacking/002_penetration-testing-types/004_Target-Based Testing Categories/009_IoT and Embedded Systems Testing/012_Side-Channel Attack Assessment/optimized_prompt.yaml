  discussion_prompt: 'Debate in groups: In resource-constrained IoT devices, are hardware countermeasures (e.g., masking circuits)
    or software ones (e.g., constant-time algorithms) more practical and effective against side-channel attacks? Use compare/contrast
    with real examples like smart cards vs. mobile apps.'
  peer_teaching: In pairs, assign types of side-channel attacks (timing, power, EM, cache). Partner A explains the attack
    mechanism and a real-world example using analogies (e.g., power like observing light under door). Partner B does teach-back
    on countermeasures, then switch.
  problem_solving: 'As ethical hackers, assess a hypothetical IoT thermostat for side-channel risks. Outline steps: select
    tools (oscilloscope, ChipWhisperer simulator), hypothesize leaks (variable execution time on key check), propose tests
    and mitigations. Apply to real-world smart home security.'
  additional_activities:
  - Think-pair-share on spotting side-channel risks in everyday IoT (e.g., fitness trackers).
  - Role-playing attacker-defender negotiation during a pen test.
  - Group project to design a side-channel assessment checklist for embedded systems.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and
  Ethical Hacking. Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for the topic ''Side-Channel Attack Assessment'' in the
  hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing Types > 004_Target-Based Testing
  Categories > IoT and Embedded Systems Testing > Side-Channel Attack Assessment.


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Prior Knowledge: Basic cryptography (symmetric/asymmetric), pen testing fundamentals, IoT security.

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the full learning_objectives array here].

  - Scaffolding: [Insert the full scaffolding object here]. Strictly generate cards progressing through the 4 layers.

  - Active Learning: Ensure cards support activities like [summarize active_learning briefly].

  - Research Context: Side-channel attacks exploit physical effects (timing, power, EM, cache); countermeasures (masking,
  constant-time); tools (ChipWhisperer); standards (NIST SP 800-57, OWASP IoT Top 10, FIPS 140-2/3).


  Use ONLY the flashcard_schema provided. Output 50-75 cards in JSON format: [{''type'': ''...'', ''layer'': 1-4, ''bloom'':
  ''REMEMBER'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...''}].

  Ensure:

  - Bloom''s progression: Build from recall to creation.

  - Distractors: Plausible, misconception-based.

  - Explanations: Detailed, pedagogical, with IoT examples.

  - No sensitive exploit details; focus on ethical assessment.

  - Sources cited in explanations (e.g., ''Per NIST SP 800-57'').
