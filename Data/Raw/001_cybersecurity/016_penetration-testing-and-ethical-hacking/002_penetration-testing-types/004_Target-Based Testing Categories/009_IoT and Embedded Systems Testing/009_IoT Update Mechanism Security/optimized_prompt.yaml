    purpose'': A) Firmware image (confuses with payload), B) Device config (overlaps with metadata), C) Transport protocol
    (mixes layers). Ensure 1-2 distractors are ''attractive errors'' from real-world vulns (e.g., weak auth).'

  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s Taxonomy):** [Insert the ''learning_objectives'' array here].


  **Active Learning Components:** Incorporate ties to: [Insert ''active_learning'' details here]. Reference in explanations
  (e.g., ''Apply in problem-solving exercise'').


  **Scaffolding Layers:** Balance cards: 30% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 20% Layer 4. [Insert full ''scaffolding''
  details here].


  **Core Content from Research:** Firmware/OTA updates, manifest (RFC 9019 metadata for integrity), vulnerabilities (auth
  bypass, no checks), standards (IETF RFC 9019 architecture, SUIT), pen testing (endpoints, exploits). Sources: RFC 9019 (datatracker.ietf.org),
  mender.io. Industry: Complete frameworks per IETF.


  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''type'': ''MCQ|ShortAnswer|Scenario'', ''bloom_level'': ''REMEMBER|etc'', ''layer'': ''1|2|3|4''}}]. Follow distractor
  protocol and explanation requirements exactly. Vary types: 40% MCQ, 30% Short Answer, 20% Scenario/Pentest, 10% Concept
  Map/Diagram description. Ensure measurable, active recall. Prioritize voter consensus (82.9%): pedagogy, completeness, integration.
