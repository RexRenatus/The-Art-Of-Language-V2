active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between CoAP's efficiency for IoT (UDP-based, low overhead) and its vulnerabilities
    to DoS/amplification attacks compared to HTTP—when should developers choose CoAP despite risks, and what mitigations (e.g.,
    RFC 9175 features) make it viable?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
