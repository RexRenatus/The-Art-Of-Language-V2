active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In resource-constrained IoT devices using MQTT, debate the trade-offs between implementing full TLS encryption
    (per RFC 9431) versus lighter security measures like token-based authentication. Which threats (confidentiality, integrity,
    availability) should be prioritized and why, considering IIoT compliance (e.g., NIST IoT)?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL 4 LAYERS FROM ABOVE] – Tag cards by layer.

  - Prior Knowledge: MQTT basics (pub-sub), pentesting meth, IoT constraints.

  - Big Picture: Critical for IIoT/NIST compliance; concept map: MQTT Security Testing → Threats (plaintext, hijacking, DoS,
  spoofed packets) → Tests/Tools (ETSI TS 103 597-2, OWASP MQTT Guide, RFC 9431 TLS, Mosquitto, Wireshark, MQTT.fx, MQTT-PWN).

  - Sources: ETSI TS 103 597-2 (MQTT security tests), OWASP MQTT Guide, RFC 9431 (MQTT-TLS), NIST IoT Cybersecurity.


  Generate flashcards per exact schema: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Ensure progression: Foundation → Integration.
  Use active recall, distractors from misconceptions. Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''tags'': [...], ''difficulty'': ''...''}, ...]. Cover all objectives, voters'' priorities (e.g., trade-offs, hands-on),
  research (plaintext, topic hijacking, etc.). High-quality, measurable, engaging for university-level learners.'
