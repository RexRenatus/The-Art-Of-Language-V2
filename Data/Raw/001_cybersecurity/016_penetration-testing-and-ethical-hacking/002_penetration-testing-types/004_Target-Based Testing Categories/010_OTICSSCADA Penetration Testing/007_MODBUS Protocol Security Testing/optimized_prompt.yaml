  discussion_prompt: 'In groups, debate the trade-offs of securing legacy MODBUS systems in critical infrastructure: Should
    operators fully replace protocols or implement layered defenses like IEC 62443? Support with real-world examples from
    CIP sectors (e.g., energy, water).'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Distractors must be plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse MODBUS TCP port 502 with HTTP 80; mix function
      codes).
    - 1 common error (e.g., outdated tool name), 1 related but wrong concept (e.g., Modbus vs. DNP3 vuln), 1 extreme/overstated
      (e.g., 'always encrypted').
    - Ensure 25-33% of flashcards are MCQ for variety.
    - 'Balance across Bloom''s levels: 40% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate/Create.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in OT/ICS penetration testing.
  Use the provided topic ''MODBUS Protocol Security Testing'' (hierarchy: [insert hierarchy]), prior knowledge, big picture
  context, learning objectives (spanning Bloom''s: Remember to Create), active learning activities, and 4 scaffolding layers
  to create optimized flashcards.


  Incorporate research: MODBUS vulnerabilities (replay, unauth command exec, DoS, data leakage, RCE); tools (Wireshark, Modbus-cli,
  ModScan, nmap-modbus, PLCscan, Scapy, Modbus Poll, ModbusPal, GrassMarlin); standards (IEC 62443, MITRE ATT&CK ICS); hands-on
  labs.


  Generate exactly 50 flashcards following the schema: Balance types (Basic Q&A/Cloze/MCQ), distractor protocol, explanations
  with measurable ties (e.g., quizzes/labs), and Bloom''s distribution. Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced
  repetition friendly, scaffolding progression.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects in the specified format. No additional text.'
