        "core_logic": "MASVS-PRIVACY focuses on controls that protect sensitive user information and ensure compliance with privacy regulations, because respecting user privacy is a critical aspect of mobile application security. This goes beyond just securing data (MASVS-STORAGE) or code (MASVS-CODE).",

        "analogy": "MASVS-PRIVACY is like ensuring a company handles your personal information responsibly and transparently, not just that the database holding it is secure."
