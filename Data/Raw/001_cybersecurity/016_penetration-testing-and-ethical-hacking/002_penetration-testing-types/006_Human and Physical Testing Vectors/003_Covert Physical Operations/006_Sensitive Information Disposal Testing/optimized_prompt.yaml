active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, analyze real-world breaches (e.g., recycled hard drives exposing sensitive data,
    contributing to 20-30% of physical vector incidents). How does sensitive information disposal testing mitigate these risks
    within the broader context of human and physical testing vectors? Debate the trade-offs between cost-effective Clear methods
    and high-assurance Destroy methods.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Confusable term (e.g., mix Clear/Purge); 3) Edge case (e.g., outdated Rev. 2 final date). Ensure plausibility from
    voter/research errors (e.g., wrong NIST dates). Prioritize higher Bloom''s for analysis/eval distractors.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and
  Ethical Hacking. Generate 20-30 high-quality flashcards on ''Sensitive Information Disposal Testing'' (Topic Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing Types > 006_Human and Physical Testing Vectors
  > Covert Physical Operations > Sensitive Information Disposal Testing).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [REMEMBER: Define...], [UNDERSTAND: Explain...], etc. (use exactly as provided).

  - Prior Knowledge: CIA triad (Confidentiality), data lifecycle, dumpster diving.

  - Big Picture: Fits physical pentesting vectors (20-30% breaches); real examples like recycled drives.

  - Scaffolding: Layer 1 Foundation (terms/NIST), Layer 2 Components (Clear/Purge/Destroy), Layer 3 Implementation (procedures/tools),
  Layer 4 Integration (workflows/compliance).

  - Concept Map: Central ''Sensitive Info Disposal Testing'' branches to NIST/media types; links from dumpster diving.

  - Accuracy: NIST SP 800-88 Rev.1 (Dec 2014), Rev.2 draft (2024, not final).

  - Active Learning Ties: Reference discussions/activities in explanations.


  Use Flashcard Schema exactly:

  - Front: Question with [BLOOM LEVEL]

  - Back: {answer, explanation (NIST refs, context, layer), bloom_level, distractors (2-3 w/ rationale), related_concept,
  active_learning_tie}

  - Types: Balanced Q&A/MCQ/Scenarios across objectives/layers.

  - Distractors: Plausible misconceptions (e.g., file delete=sanitization; wrong NIST dates).


  Output ONLY a JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}}, ...]. Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced
  repetition friendly, progressive complexity.'
