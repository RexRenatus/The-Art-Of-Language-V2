active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In a world where cyber threats dominate headlines, debate the relative importance of physical access
    controls versus digital firewalls in preventing data breaches, using real-world examples like the 2010 Operation Aurora
    or recent supply chain attacks. Consider: Does neglecting physical security undermine even the strongest cyber defenses?'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Physical security is obsolete' as distractor)
    - From research context (e.g., confuse PE-3 with cyber controls)
    - Voter-suggested errors (e.g., overlook social engineering in technical tests)
    - Similar terms (e.g., badge vs. biometric vulnerabilities swapped)
    - Stats twisted (e.g., '20% vs. 80% breaches physical')
    count: Always 3 distractors for MCQs, labeled A-D with one correct

  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [paste full list above]

  - Active learning: Embed prompts/examples from [discussion_prompt, peer_teaching_activity, etc.] into explanations.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [paste scaffolding details]; tag each card.

  - Big picture: Role in Security Onion model; 80% breaches start physical (Verizon DBIR). Concept map integration.

  - Research: NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 PE family (PE-3 Physical Access Control), ePACS overlay (smart cards, key mgmt, audits
  per SP 800-116). Sources: NIST SP 800-53R5, SP 800-116, Verizon DBIR 2023, OWASP Physical Security Testing Guide.


  Use exact flashcard schema: {front: ''...'', back: {answer: ''...'', explanation: ''... (tie to Bloom/scaffolding/NIST/active
