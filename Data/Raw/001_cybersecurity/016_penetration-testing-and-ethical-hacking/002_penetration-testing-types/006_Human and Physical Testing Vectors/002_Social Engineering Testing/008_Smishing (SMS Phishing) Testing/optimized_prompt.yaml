active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the balance between conducting realistic smishing simulations to effectively test employee awareness
    and maintaining ethical boundaries, such as obtaining explicit consent and minimizing psychological impacts. Discuss mitigation
    strategies like anonymized debriefing and real-world examples from pentesting reports.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    all mobiles); 2) Close but incorrect (e.g., ''Requires app install'' vs. link click); 3) Overgeneralization (e.g., ''Identical
    to email phishing''). Base on research context (e.g., Kaspersky tactics) and voter completeness gaps (e.g., ethics/tools).
    Ensure distractors are realistic to challenge learners without frustrating.'

  - Learning objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM JSON ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding layers: [PASTE FULL LAYERS FROM JSON ABOVE]

  - Active learning for context: [PASTE FULL ACTIVE LEARNING FROM JSON ABOVE]

  - Research context: Smishing is SMS phishing using social engineering (impersonation via text for links/malware/data theft;
  sources: Kaspersky, Norton, CrowdStrike). Key: exploits trust/urgency; testing involves ethical simulation (planning, craft/send/track,
  debrief).

  - Voter consensus: Emphasize ethics/legal (consent), steps (planning-execution-reporting), tools (SMS gateways like Twilio),
  metrics, comparisons to phishing.


  Strictly follow the flashcard schema: [PASTE FULL SCHEMA FROM JSON ABOVE]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 60 flashcard objects,
  e.g., [{''question'': ''...'', ''correct_answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''a'', ''b'', ''c''],
  ''bloom_level'': ''Apply'', ''layer'': 3, ''tags'': [''smishing'', ''tools'']}, ...]. Ensure pedagogical optimization: spaced
  repetition-friendly, Bloom''s progression, active recall via scenarios. No additional text.'
