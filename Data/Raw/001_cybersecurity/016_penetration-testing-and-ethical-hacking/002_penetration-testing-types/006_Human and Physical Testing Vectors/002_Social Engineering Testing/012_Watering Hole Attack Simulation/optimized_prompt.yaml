active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical implications of simulating a watering hole attack during penetration
    testing. Consider scenarios where deconfliction fails—how would you mitigate risks to avoid real-world disruptions? Reference
    real-world examples like industry-targeted attacks and evaluate trade-offs between realism and safety.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: '1. Source from common errors: e.g., Watering hole ≠ phishing (distractor: ''Email-based''). 2. Use
    research variants: e.g., ''Random websites'' vs. targeted. 3. Pen testing pitfalls: ''No deconfliction needed'' vs. coordination.
    4. Plausibility: High (similar terms like ''drive-by'' confused with downloads), Medium (scale vs. spear phishing), Low
    (unrelated like ''DDoS''). Always explain why distractors are wrong in back.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and
  Ethical Hacking. Topic: ''Watering Hole Attack Simulation'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical
  Hacking > Penetration Testing Types > 006_Human and Physical Testing Vectors > Social Engineering Testing > Watering Hole
  Attack Simulation). Use this research context: Watering hole attacks compromise sites frequented by targets to deliver malware
  (drive-by, RATs, zero-days); pen testing simulations require ethical recon, safe payloads, deconfliction (coordinate RoE,
  avoid disruptions). Sources: kratikal.com, ncsc.gov.uk.
