active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical implications of QPQ testing on individual employees versus
    its value in strengthening organizational security. How can testers ensure psychological safety while simulating real
    threats? Support your views with examples from defense-in-depth strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

- level: 1
  name: Layer 1
  focus: ''
  content: 'Define key terms: Social engineering (psychological manipulation for info/access); Penetration testing (authorized
    simulation of attacks); Quid Pro Quo (Latin: ''something for something''). Accurate QPQ definition: In ethical hacking,
    the tester offers a favor/service/benefit to an individual employee (quid) in exchange for sensitive information, credentials,
    or access (pro quo). Emphasize individual targeting, not organization-wide.'
- level: 2
  name: Layer 2
  focus: ''
  content: 'Break down elements: Exchange mechanism (plausible offer like fake IT help, free swag vs. gained info); Target
    selection (employees via research); Rapport building (pretexting for trust); Relation to broader SE tactics (subset of
    human testing vectors, distinct from non-exchange methods like phishing).'
- level: 3
  name: Layer 3
  focus: ''
  content: 'Step-by-step process: 1. Obtain explicit authorization and define narrow scope (due to personnel interaction).
    2. Intelligence gathering: Research employee roles/contacts. 3. Develop offer (e.g., ''I''ll fix your slow PC for your
    login''). 4. Execute interaction (phone/email/in-person rapport). 5. Exploit gained info (access systems). 6. Debrief
    participants, report findings with metrics.'
- level: 4
  name: Layer 4
  focus: ''
  content: 'Link to PTES (Intelligence Gathering, Exploitation phases); Connect to physical vectors (e.g., on-site delivery
    for rapport); Optimize via metrics (success rates pre/post-training); Advanced combos (QPQ + phishing for hybrid attacks).
    Holistic role: Tests human controls essential for comprehensive pentesting.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert cybersecurity educator and flashcard generator specializing in Penetration Testing and Ethical
  Hacking. Generate high-quality, Anki-optimized flashcards for the topic ''Quid Pro Quo Testing'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing Types > 006_Human and Physical Testing Vectors > Social
  Engineering Testing > Quid Pro Quo Testing).


  CRITICAL ACCURACY: QPQ testing involves the tester (simulating attacker) offering a benefit/service (quid: e.g., fake IT
  help) to an INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE in exchange for sensitive info/access (pro quo). NEVER reverse the exchange (tester does
  NOT receive from org first). Base on corrected social engineering standards, PTES frameworks.
