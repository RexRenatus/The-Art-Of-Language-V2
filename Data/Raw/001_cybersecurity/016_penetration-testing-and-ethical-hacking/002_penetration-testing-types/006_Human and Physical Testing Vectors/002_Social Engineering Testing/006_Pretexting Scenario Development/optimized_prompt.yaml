active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the effectiveness of pretexting versus phishing in a corporate setting. Debate which is more
    dangerous and why, using real-world examples (e.g., Kevin Mitnick's tactics or recent breaches). Consider defenses like
    awareness training (NIST SP 800-53 AW-2) and MITRE ATT&CK mappings.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - Research Context: Pretexting involves fabricating scenarios for trust manipulation via OSINT research, impersonation (IT/CEO/vendor),
  spoofing (caller ID/email/deepfakes). Steps: Research > Impersonate > Spoof > Execute. Standards: MITRE ATT&CK T1587.001
  (Persona Development), NIST SP 800-53 AW-2, OSSTMM. Sources: trendmicro.com, stationx.net.

  Ensure flashcards progress Bloom''s Taxonomy, reference scaffolding layers, tie to active learning (e.g., ''Relates to discussion
  on pretexting vs. phishing''), and promote active recall. Output as a JSON array: [{''id'':1, ''bloom_level'':''REMEMBER'',
  ''scaffolding_layer'':''1'', ''type'':''mcq|basic'', ''front'':''...'', ''back'':{...}, ''tags'':[''objective_1'', ''prerequisite_osint'']},
  ...]. Vary difficulty; include 20% higher-order (apply/analyze/evaluate/create) with scenario prompts.'
