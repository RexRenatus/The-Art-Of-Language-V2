active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between implementing a strict CSP policy (e.g., no unsafe-inline)
    versus maintaining site usability. Provide real-world examples from sources like OWASP and justify your stance using misconfiguration
    risks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    distractors are realistic from research context (e.g., wildcard misuse) and teach via explanation.'

  Incorporate this optimized learning framework:

  - **Learning Objectives**: [Insert the full ''learning_objectives'' array here].

  - **Active Learning Hooks**: Reference discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving in explanations to model engagement.

  - **Scaffolding Layers**: [Insert the full ''scaffolding_layers'' array here]. Distribute flashcards across layers.

  - **Content Completeness**: Cover voter priorities - misconfigs (unsafe-inline, wildcards, unsafe-eval, nonce issues); bypasses
  (JSONP endpoints, base64 data: URIs, blob: URLs, DOM manipulation); sources (OWASP CSP Cheat Sheet, PortSwigger Labs, MDN,
  NIST).

  - **Prerequisites**: Assume knowledge of HTTP headers, XSS; link back as needed.

  - **Ethical Focus**: Emphasize authorized pentesting only.


  Use this **Flashcard Schema**: [Insert the full ''flashcard_schema'' here]. Output 75 flashcards in JSON array format: [{''front'':
  ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'', ''opt3'']}, ''metadata'':
  {...}}, ...]. Ensure variety, high-quality distractors, and progression from foundation to integration. Balance Bloom''s
  levels.'
