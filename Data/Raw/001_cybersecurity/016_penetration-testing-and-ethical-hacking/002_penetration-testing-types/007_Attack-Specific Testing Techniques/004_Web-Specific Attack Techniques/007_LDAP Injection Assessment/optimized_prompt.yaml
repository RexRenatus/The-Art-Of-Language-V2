active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, compare LDAP Injection to SQL Injection: How do metacharacters like ''*'' or
    ''!'' enable bypass techniques? Share a real-world example from OWASP or Active Directory exploits and debate the most
    effective prevention strategy for web applications.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    are 70% similar to correct answer for active recall challenge. Label as A/B/C/D with one correct.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing. Generate
  50 high-quality flashcards for ''LDAP Injection Assessment'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical
  Hacking > Penetration Testing Types > 007_Attack-Specific Testing Techniques > Web-Specific Attack Techniques > LDAP Injection
  Assessment). Ensure 82.9% voter-approved completeness: Cover all types (Authentication Bypass, Privilege Escalation, DoS,
  Command Execution) with examples/payloads; prerequisites (builds on SQLi); pen testing steps (identify LDAP, fuzz with *,(),&|!,
  tools: Burp Suite, ldapsearch); sources (OWASP LDAP Injection, RFC 4515); real-world AD exploits; mitigations.


  Incorporate university pedagogy:

  - Distribute across Bloom''s levels per these objectives: [insert learning_objectives array here].

  - Scaffolding: Layer 1 Foundation (terms), Layer 2 Components (types/mechanics), Layer 3 Implementation (tools/payloads),
  Layer 4 Integration (mitigations/comparisons).

  - Active learning: Tie cards to discussion (LDAP vs SQLi), peer teaching (types quiz), problem-solving (code exploit).


  Use exact flashcard schema:

  Output ONLY JSON array of 50 flashcards: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''hints'': [...], ''source'': ''...''}}, ...]. Balance: 20% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze,
  30% Evaluate, 20% Create. 40% MCQ with distractors. Ensure web-grounded (OWASP/RFC), engaging, and testable for pen testers.'
