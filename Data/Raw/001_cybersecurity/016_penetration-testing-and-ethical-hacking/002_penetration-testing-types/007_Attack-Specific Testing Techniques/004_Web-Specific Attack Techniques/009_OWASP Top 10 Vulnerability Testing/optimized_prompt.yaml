active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In groups of 4, debate which OWASP Top 10:2025 vulnerability poses the greatest risk to modern web applications
    (e.g., SaaS platforms). Use real-world examples like the 2023 MOVEit breach for Broken Access Control or Log4Shell for
    Injection. Propose prioritized mitigation strategies and vote on the top risk after 15 minutes.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

      Control with Auth). Ensure plausible to advanced learners.'
    count: Use MCQ for 40% of cards; others Q&A or cloze.
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in OWASP Top 10 Vulnerability\
  \ Testing (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing Types > 007_Attack-Specific\
  \ Testing Techniques > Web-Specific Attack Techniques > OWASP Top 10 Vulnerability Testing). Use OWASP Top 10:2025 Release\
  \ Candidate categories (A01:Broken Access Control, A02:Identification Failures, etc.), complete WSTG mappings, tools (Burp,\
  \ ZAP, sqlmap), and pentest integration.\n\nIncorporate these pedagogical elements:\n- Learning Objectives: [insert full\
  \ list above]\n- Active Learning: Tie cards to activities (e.g., 'Apply to Juice Shop exercise')\n- Scaffolding: Distribute\
  \ cards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 30% Layer 3, 20% Layer 4\n- Prior Knowledge: Assume basics (HTTP, CIA triad); link where\
  \ needed.\n- Voter Consensus: 82.9% approval; ensure completeness, pedagogy, big picture (pentest lifecycle).\n- Research:\
  \ OWASP Top 10 as de facto standard for web app risks.\n\nGenerate 75 high-quality flashcards following this exact JSON\
