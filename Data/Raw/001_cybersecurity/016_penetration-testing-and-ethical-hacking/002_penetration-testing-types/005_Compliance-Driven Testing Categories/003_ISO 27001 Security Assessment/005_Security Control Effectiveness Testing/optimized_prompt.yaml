active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss the misconception that 'achieving ISO 27001 compliance guarantees complete security.' Provide
    real-world examples of effective controls (e.g., MFA resisting brute-force attacks) versus ineffective ones (e.g., unpatched
    software exploited in breaches like Equifax), and debate how effectiveness testing bridges compliance and real security.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truth/mix-up (e.g., wrong NIST phase), 3) Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Always use only automated tools'').
    Ensure distractors are realistic from voter-noted pitfalls or research context. Balance card types: 40% definition/remember,
    30% apply/analyze scenarios, 20% evaluate/create, 10% MCQs.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and
  Ethical Hacking. Generate 50 high-quality, spaced-repetition-optimized flashcards for the topic ''Security Control Effectiveness
  Testing'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing Types > 005_Compliance-Driven
  Testing Categories > ISO 27001 Security Assessment > Security Control Effectiveness Testing).

  Best practices: 60% active recall (cloze/open-ended), 40% MCQ. Cover all Bloom''s levels proportionally. Ensure completeness
  with NIST SP 800-115 steps, ISO 27001 links, best practices, examples, misconceptions. Cards must be university-level, measurable,
  and scaffolded (tag layer). Vary difficulty progressively. No duplicates; optimize for Anki/Quizlet import.'
