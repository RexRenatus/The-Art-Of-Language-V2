active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how penetration testing integrates into the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle
    of ISO 27001 for ISMS validation. Provide examples of successes (e.g., pen testing preventing ransomware via validated
    controls) and non-examples (e.g., certified company breached due to untested vulnerabilities).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules: Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse ISO 27001:2013 controls
      with non-existent ones like A.8.29; mix vulnerability scanning with full exploitation; outdated 2022 control numbers).
      Ensure distractors are realistic from research context (e.g., wrong control purpose, incomplete validation steps). One
      distractor per Bloom's level pitfall.
