active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate whether penetration testing alone is sufficient to comply with GDPR Article 32, or if additional
    measures like DPIA are always necessary. Support arguments with real-world breach examples (e.g., British Airways 2018
    fine for inadequate security measures) and reference ICO guidance.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains the DPIA process and when it is mandatory under GDPR Article 35 (e.g., high-risk
    processing), while the other quizzes them on triggers and outputs; then switch roles and incorporate Article 32 TOMs into
    the explanation.
  problem_solving: Given a mock e-commerce site handling EU customer data, design a pentest plan targeting GDPR compliance
    vulnerabilities (e.g., weak encryption, untested resilience). Include scoping, methodology (e.g., OWASP testing for access
    controls), reporting to a fictional Data Protection Officer, and remediation recommendations.
  additional_activities:
  - 'Role-play: Act as an ethical hacker presenting GDPR pentest findings to a Data Protection Officer, justifying non-compliance
    risks.'
  - 'Think-pair-share: Discuss common misconceptions (e.g., ''GDPR only applies to EU companies'') and correct them with evidence
    from research context.'

  Incorporate:

  - Research context: GDPR (EU personal data regulation, rights like access/erasure); personal data; TOMs from Article 32
  (pseudonymisation/encryption; confidentiality/integrity/availability/resilience; restore availability; regular testing/evaluation;
  process minimisation); DPIA (Article 35); pentesting for compliance (rhinosecuritylabs.com, ico.org.uk, eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679).

  - Voter consensus: Full TOMs list; real-world cases; prerequisites from basic pentesting.

  - Pedagogy: Objectives [insert learning_objectives array]; Scaffolding [insert scaffolding object]; Active learning [insert
