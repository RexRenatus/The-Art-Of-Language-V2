active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the effectiveness of penetration testing as mandated by NIST SP 800-53 CA-8 in ensuring FISMA
    compliance. Debate whether it should be supplemented with other methods like red teaming or continuous monitoring, considering
    real-world constraints such as budget and resource limitations in federal agencies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Common errors: From voter notes/research (e.g., incomplete stages, ignore ROE). 3. Plausibility: Draw from related concepts
    (e.g., RMF steps as distractors for 800-115). 4. Balance: Ensure 75% MCQs, 25% open-ended. Generate 40-60 cards covering
    all layers/objectives proportionally (10-15 per layer).'
