active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the effectiveness of NIST SP 800-53 controls in addressing modern threats like zero-day exploits
    in cloud environments. Select specific control families (e.g., AU Audit and Accountability) and argue for or against their
    sufficiency, citing real-world breach examples such as SolarWinds or Capital One.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    methods (examine vs. test), reference similar frameworks (CSF subcategories). Ensure 60% basic cards (Layer 1-2), 40%
    MCQ/application (Layer 3-4). Cover all control families/examples minimally.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST SP 800-53 Control
  Assessment (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing Types > 005_Compliance-Driven
  Testing Categories > NIST Framework Testing > NIST SP 800-53 Control Assessment). Use the provided research context on SP
  800-53A Rev. 5 (assessing SP 800-53 Rev. 5 controls via examine/interview/test in RMF/SDLC), voter consensus (100% approval),
  and pedagogical elements below to generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards.


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s Taxonomy):** [Insert full list above].

  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Incorporate elements from discussion (modern threats), peer teaching (e.g., SC-8), problem-solving
  (hybrid cloud scenario).

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full layers above, including concept map and sources].

  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly follow [insert schema above]. Output ONLY JSON array of flashcards, e.g., [{''type'': ''mcq'',
  ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [...], ''tags'': [...]}]. Ensure coverage:
  4-6 cards per Bloom''s level, progressive scaffolding, distractors per protocol. Make explanations educational, citing sources/NIST
  docs for verification.'
