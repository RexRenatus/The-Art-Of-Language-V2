  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the shift from reactive Blue Team defenses (as covered in Entry Subdomain:
    Blue Team Defense Assessment) to proactive threat hunting. How does addressing higher levels of the Pyramid of Pain (e.g.,
    TTPs vs. IPs) advance SOC maturity? Provide evidence from MITRE ATT&CK examples and evaluate trade-offs in resource allocation.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives** (span Bloom''s): [paste the learning_objectives array here]

  - **Scaffolding Layers** (4 progressive): [paste scaffolding object here]

  - **Active Learning** for context: [reference activities for scenario inspiration]

  - **Research Context**: Threat Hunting (SANS), LOTL (CISA), Pyramid of Pain/MITRE ATT&CK/HMM (SANS.org/media/analyst-program/building-maturing-threat-hunting-program-39025.pdf;
  cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-03/Joint-Guidance-Identifying-and-Mitigating-LOTL508.pdf; attack.mitre.org). Best Practices:
  Hypothesis-driven hunts, ATT&CK mapping, HMM levels (1-5: Ad-hoc to Optimized), TTP focus.


  **Flashcard Generation Rules**:

  - Follow exact schema: JSON array of 30 objects [{front: str, back: {answer: str, explanation: str, distractors: [str,str,str]
  if MCQ}, tags: [str]}].

  - Cover all layers/objectives evenly; tag each.

  - MCQ: 1 correct (A/B/C/D), 3 distractors per protocol.

  - Cloze: [text with gap].

  - Explanations: Cite sources, link to objectives/layers.

  - Ensure active recall: Varied formats, no verbatim copies.

  - Distractors: Plausible, explained in explanation.


  Output ONLY the JSON array. No additional text.'
