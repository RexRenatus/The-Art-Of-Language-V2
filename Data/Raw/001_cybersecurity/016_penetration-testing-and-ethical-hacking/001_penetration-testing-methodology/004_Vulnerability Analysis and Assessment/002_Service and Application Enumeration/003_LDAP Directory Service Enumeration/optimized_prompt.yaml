active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss a real-world scenario where LDAP enumeration reveals sensitive information (e.g., user accounts
    or group policies). How does this fit into PTES/MITRE ATT&CK Reconnaissance (TA0001), and what defensive measures could
    blue teams implement?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
