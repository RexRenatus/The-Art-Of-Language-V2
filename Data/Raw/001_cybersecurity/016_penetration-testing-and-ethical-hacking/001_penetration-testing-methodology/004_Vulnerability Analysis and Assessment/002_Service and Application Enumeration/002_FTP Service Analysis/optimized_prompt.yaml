  discussion_prompt: 'Debate: ''Should plain FTP be completely deprecated in enterprise environments, or are there scenarios
    where mitigations (e.g., IP restrictions, VPN tunneling) suffice?'' Discuss risks like cleartext credentials, proxy bounce
    attacks, legacy system support, and compliance standards (e.g., RFC 2577). Address common misconception: Many believe
    FTP is ''secure enough'' like HTTP was before HTTPS adoption. Students take pro/con sides, cite evidence from research,
    and vote on a resolution.'
  peer_teaching: 'Pair students: Partner A explains active vs. passive FTP modes using hand-drawn connection diagrams (server/client
    ports, firewall implications) and teaches control vs. data connections; Partner B covers proxy bounce attacks, brute-force
    risks, and RFC 2577 considerations. Use teach-back: The listener quizzes the explainer with 3 questions (e.g., ''Why does
    passive mode help with firewalls?''). Switch roles after 10 minutes and debrief misconceptions.'
  problem_solving: 'Real-world scenario: In groups, analyze an FTP service on a vulnerable VM like Metasploitable 2. Steps:
    1) Use Nmap (-sV -sC 21) for enumeration and banner grabbing; 2) Test anonymous login (ftp anon); 3) Simulate safe brute-force
    with Hydra (limited attempts); 4) Check for bounce vulnerabilities; 5) Identify issues per RFC 2577; 6) Design migration
    to FTPS/SFTP. Groups present findings, tools used, and risk ratings in 5 minutes each.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing. Use
  the provided topic ''FTP Service Analysis'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration
  Testing Methodology > 004_Vulnerability Analysis and Assessment > Service and Application Enumeration > FTP Service Analysis).
  Integrate university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives, active learning (discussion/peer/problem-solving), 4-layer
  scaffolding (Foundation/Components/Implementation/Integration), prior knowledge (TCP/IP, Nmap recon), big picture (vuln
  analysis phase), and research context (RFC 959/2577, cleartext risks, bounce attacks, accurate modes: Active=server-to-client
  data conn from 20; Passive=client-to-server dynamic).
