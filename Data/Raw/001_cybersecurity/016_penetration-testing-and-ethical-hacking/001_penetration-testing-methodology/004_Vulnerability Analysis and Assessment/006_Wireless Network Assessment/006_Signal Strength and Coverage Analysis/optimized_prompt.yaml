active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how poor signal coverage and high interference contribute to successful
    evil twin attacks or rogue AP exploitation during penetration testing. Use real-world examples from wardriving scenarios
    and reference SNR thresholds to support your arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., confuse dBm with absolute
    power vs. logarithmic; SNR with signal alone); 2) Related but incorrect terms (e.g., RSSI vs. SNR); 3) Edge cases (e.g.,
    outdoor vs. indoor values); 4) Voter-suggested pitfalls (e.g., ignoring noise floor). Ensure distractors are realistic
    for pentesting scenarios.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and\
  \ Ethical Hacking. Generate 25 high-quality flashcards for the topic 'Signal Strength and Coverage Analysis' (Category:\
  \ Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing Methodology > 004_Vulnerability Analysis\
  \ and Assessment > Wireless Network Assessment > Signal Strength and Coverage Analysis).\n\nIncorporate these elements:\n\
  - Learning Objectives: [REMEMBER: Define key terms... CREATE: Design a secure... ] (as listed above).\n- Scaffolding Layers:\
  \ [Layer 1: Foundation... Layer 4: Integration] (as detailed above).\n- Active Learning: Draw from discussion (evil twins),\
  \ peer teaching (tools), problem-solving (site survey analysis).\n- Prior Knowledge: OSI Layers 1-2, 802.11 standards, pentesting\
  \ recon.\n- Big Picture: Phase 2 Scanning/Vuln Assessment; enables wireless risk prioritization.\n- Key Concepts: Signal\
  \ strength (dBm), coverage, RF propagation, noise floor, SNR, interference, bleed-through, rogue APs, cell size.\n- Tools:\
  \ Aircrack-ng/Airodump-ng, Kismet, Wireshark, Ekahau.\n- Sources: ITU-R P.1411-11 (https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-P.1411/en\
  \ - propagation models); IEEE 802.11 (https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/802.11/); NIST SP 800-153 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-153.pdf).\n\
  \nFollow the Flashcard Schema exactly:\n- Output as JSON array: [\n  {\n    \"question\": \"...\",\n    \"options\": [\"\
  A. ...\", \"B. ...\", \"C. ...\", \"D. ...\"],\n    \"correct_answer\": \"A\",\n    \"explanation\": \"...\",\n    \"tags\"\
  : [\"bloom_level: remember\", \"layer: 1\", ...],\n    \"difficulty\": \"easy\"\n  }\n]\n- Ensure MCQs test Bloom's progression,\
  \ use distractor protocol (misconceptions like dBm confusion, plausible pentest errors).\n- Balance: 8 easy (Layers 1-2),\
  \ 10 medium (Layers 2-3), 7 hard (Layer 4). Include calculations (e.g., SNR = -50 - (-90) = 40dB), tool commands, scenarios.\n\
  - Make educational: Explanations reference objectives/layers/sources for active recall and spaced repetition."
