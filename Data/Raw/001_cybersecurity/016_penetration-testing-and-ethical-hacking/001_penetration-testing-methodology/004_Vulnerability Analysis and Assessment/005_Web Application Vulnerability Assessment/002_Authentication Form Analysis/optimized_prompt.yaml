active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether traditional password-based authentication forms are obsolete in modern
    web applications given NIST SP 800-63 guidelines and rising MFA adoption. Provide examples of real-world breaches like
    the 2012 LinkedIn hack due to weak auth, and discuss pentesting implications.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    XSS'' instead of CSRF attacks); 1 mixing related concepts (e.g., ''Rate limiting'' vs. ''CAPTCHA'' for brute-force); 1
    from tangential standards (e.g., OWASP vs. NIST mismatch). Ensure distractors are realistic for pentesting scenarios.'

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert full layers above].

  - Active Learning: Use concepts from discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving to inspire applied cards.

  - Research Context: Focus on pentesting auth forms (vulns: brute-force, no rate limiting, SQLi, session fixation, client-side
  bypass, default creds; tools: Burp Suite, ZAP; standards: NIST SP 800-63B/4 Digital Identity Guidelines - authenticators,
  MFA; OWASP Top 10 A07).


  Generate 60 high-quality flashcards following this schema exactly:

  [insert full flashcard_schema above].


  Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''MCQ|Q/A|cloze'', ''bloom_level'': ''REMEMBER|etc'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''1-4'',
  ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...''}].

  Ensure cards progress from lower to higher Bloom''s, cover all layers/objectives, use distractor protocol strictly. Prioritize
  practical pentesting over theory. Make explanations educational for active learning.'
