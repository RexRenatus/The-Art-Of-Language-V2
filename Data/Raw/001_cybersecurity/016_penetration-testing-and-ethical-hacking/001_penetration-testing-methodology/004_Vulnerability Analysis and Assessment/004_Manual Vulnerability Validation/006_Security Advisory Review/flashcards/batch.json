        "core_logic": "Cross-referencing with frameworks like NIST or OWASP is important because these provide standardized definitions, risk ratings, and best-practice recommendations, which helps validate the findings and communicate their significance and remediation strategies in a universally understood manner.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors suggest that frameworks are used for automated code generation, proving tester skill, or fulfilling legal reporting obligations, rather than their actual purpose of providing standardized context and best practices.",
        "analogy": "Referencing NIST or OWASP during a review is like a doctor consulting established medical guidelines; it ensures the diagnosis and treatment plan are based on proven knowledge and standards."
