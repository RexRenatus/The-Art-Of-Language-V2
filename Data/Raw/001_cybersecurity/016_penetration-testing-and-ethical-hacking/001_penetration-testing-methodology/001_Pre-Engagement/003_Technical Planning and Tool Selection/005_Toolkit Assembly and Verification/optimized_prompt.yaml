active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the risks of skipping toolkit verification (e.g., using unpatched tools
    leading to false positives or detection). Reference PTES Pre-Engagement standards and share real-world examples from sources
    like OWASP or NIST SP 800-115. What mitigation strategies would you propose?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Base on common misconceptions: e.g., ''Verification is only licensing'' (ignores hashes/tests); ''Any tool works without
      scope'' (ignores PTES alignment).'
    - 'Use plausible alternatives: Partial truths (e.g., ''Update packages only'' vs. full verification), outdated practices,
      or role confusions (e.g., Nmap for exploitation).'
    - 'Vary by layer: Layer 1 (definitions), Layer 2 (tool mismatches), Layer 3 (step skips), Layer 4 (integration gaps).'
    - 'Ensure 3 distractors per MCQ: 1 superficially similar, 1 opposite, 1 unrelated.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing. Use
  the following context to generate high-quality, Anki-optimized flashcards for the topic ''Toolkit Assembly and Verification''
  (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing Methodology > 001_Pre-Engagement
  > Technical Planning and Tool Selection > Toolkit Assembly and Verification).


  **Completed Research Context (PTES-focused):** PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard, http://www.pentest-standard.org/)
  defines Pre-Engagement as scoping, RoE, and technical planning—including toolkit selection. Core tools: Nmap (recon/scanning),
  Metasploit (exploitation), Burp Suite/ZAP (web apps), Wireshark (traffic), John/Hydra (cracking), Empire/Covenant (post-ex).
  Base: Kali Linux (apt update; apt install kali-linux-default). Verification: Hash checks (sha256sum tool.deb), version tests,
  lab scans (e.g., nmap -sV metasploitable). Standards: NIST SP 800-115 (http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-115.pdf),
  OWASP Testing Guide (https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/). Best practices: Scope-aligned selection,
  isolated VMs, chaining tools. Sources: Sprinto (https://sprinto.com/blog/penetration-testing-methodologies/), Medium PTES
  guide.
