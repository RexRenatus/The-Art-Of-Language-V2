active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue the pros and cons of using Kali Linux versus Parrot OS for a web application
    penetration test under hardware constraints (e.g., low RAM VM). Reference PTES guidelines and real-world tool dependencies
    like Burp Suite integration.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (40% of cards): Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common errors (e.g., confuse Kali''s
    rolling release with Parrot''s stability; mix up tool counts; misalign criteria like ''high resource use'' for lightweight
    distro). Ensure distractors are realistic from pros/cons (e.g., ''BlackArch has fewer tools'' as distractor for Kali).'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and\
  \ Ethical Hacking. Generate 50 high-quality, spaced-repetition-optimized flashcards on 'Penetration Testing Distribution\
  \ Selection' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing Methodology\
  \ > 001_Pre-Engagement > Technical Planning and Tool Selection > Penetration Testing Distribution Selection).\n\nIncorporate\
  \ these elements:\n- **Learning Objectives**: Cover all 6 Bloom's levels provided.\n- **Scaffolding**: Distribute cards\
  \ across 4 layers (10-15 per layer), progressing from foundation to integration.\n- **Active Learning**: 20% of cards link\
  \ to activities (e.g., 'Use in discussion: ...').\n- **Content Completeness**: Include Kali Linux (pros: 600+ tools, Metasploit/Nmap/Burp;\
  \ cons: heavy), Parrot OS (pros: lightweight, anonymity; cons: fewer tools), BlackArch (pros: 2500+ tools; cons: unstable).\
  \ Selection criteria: toolset, updates, hardware, deployment. Standards: PTES (7 phases), NIST SP 800-115 (tool testing\
  \ guidelines), OWASP, PCI DSS. Sources: PTES (https://www.pentest-standard.org/), NIST (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-115.pdf),\
  \ OWASP (https://owasp.org/), PCI DSS (https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/).\n\n**Flashcard Mix**: 40% MCQ (w/ 3 distractors),\
  \ 20% short answer, 20% scenario apply, 10% compare/analyze, 10% evaluate/create.\n\n**Output Format (JSON array of objects)**:\n\
  [\n  {\n    \"front\": \"Question text\",\n    \"back\": {\n      \"answer\": \"Correct answer\",\n      \"bloom_level\"\
