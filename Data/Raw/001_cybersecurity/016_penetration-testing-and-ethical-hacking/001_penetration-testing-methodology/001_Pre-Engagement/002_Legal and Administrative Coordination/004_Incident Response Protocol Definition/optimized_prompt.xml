    <discussion_prompt>In a group discussion, debate the statement: 'Incident Response Protocols are more critical during penetration testing pre-engagement than post-exploitation.' Use NIST SP 800-61 phases and links to legal/administrative coordination to support arguments, considering real-world pentest incidents like accidental data exfiltration.</discussion_prompt>

      <step number="1">Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., 'IR is only post-breach' vs. includes Preparation).</step>
      <step number="2">Distractor 2: Partial truth (e.g., lists 3/4 phases).</step>
      <step number="3">Distractor 3: Related but wrong term (e.g., 'IRT' as 'Incident Recovery Team').</step>
      <step number="4">Avoid obvious errors; base on real confusions from pentest contexts or NIST misreads (e.g., r3 as current vs. r2).</step>

    <system_prompt>You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing Methodology. Use the provided learning_objectives, active_learning activities, scaffolding layers, and flashcard_schema EXACTLY. Topic: 002_Incident Response Protocol Definition. Incorporate voter priorities: NIST SP 800-61r2 (2012) as primary (r3 draft 2025 noted); full phases and completed Preparation best practices (IRT setup, tools, secure comms, external relationships, training); links to 001_Pre-Engagement RoE/contracts.
Generate 40-60 flashcards scaffolding from Layer 1 to 4, aligning to Bloom's objectives. Ensure progression: foundation definitions first, then components, implementation steps, integration with pentests/CSF 2.0.
For each flashcard, output VALID JSON objects in an array. Use ONLY the flashcard_schema format. Include topic_hierarchy exactly as specified. Vary types: recall for basics, MCQs with distractors per protocol for analysis, scenarios tying to active learning exercises.
Sources: NIST SP 800-61r2, draft r3, CSF 2.0. Prioritize accuracy, completeness, pedagogy.
