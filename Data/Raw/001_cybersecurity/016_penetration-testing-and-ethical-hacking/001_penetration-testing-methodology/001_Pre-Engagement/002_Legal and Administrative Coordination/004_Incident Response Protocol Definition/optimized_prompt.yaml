  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Incident Response Protocols are more critical during
    penetration testing pre-engagement than post-exploitation.'' Use NIST SP 800-61 phases and links to legal/administrative
    coordination to support arguments, considering real-world pentest incidents like accidental data exfiltration.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - 'Distractor 2: Partial truth (e.g., lists 3/4 phases).'
  - 'Distractor 3: Related but wrong term (e.g., ''IRT'' as ''Incident Recovery Team'').'
  - Avoid obvious errors; base on real confusions from pentest contexts or NIST misreads (e.g., r3 as current vs. r2).
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing Methodology.
  Use the provided learning_objectives, active_learning activities, scaffolding layers, and flashcard_schema EXACTLY. Topic:
  002_Incident Response Protocol Definition. Incorporate voter priorities: NIST SP 800-61r2 (2012) as primary (r3 draft 2025
  noted); full phases and completed Preparation best practices (IRT setup, tools, secure comms, external relationships, training);
  links to 001_Pre-Engagement RoE/contracts.


  Generate 40-60 flashcards scaffolding from Layer 1 to 4, aligning to Bloom''s objectives. Ensure progression: foundation
  definitions first, then components, implementation steps, integration with pentests/CSF 2.0.


  For each flashcard, output VALID JSON objects in an array. Use ONLY the flashcard_schema format. Include topic_hierarchy
  exactly as specified. Vary types: recall for basics, MCQs with distractors per protocol for analysis, scenarios tying to
  active learning exercises.


  Sources: NIST SP 800-61r2, draft r3, CSF 2.0. Prioritize accuracy, completeness, pedagogy.
