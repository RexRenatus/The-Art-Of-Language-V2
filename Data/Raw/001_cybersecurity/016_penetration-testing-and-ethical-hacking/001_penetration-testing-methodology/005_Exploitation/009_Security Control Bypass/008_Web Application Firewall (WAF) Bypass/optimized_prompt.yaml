active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the ethical boundaries of WAF bypass techniques: How can pentesters ensure
    their testing simulates real threats without enabling misuse? Reference legal frameworks like the Computer Fraud and Abuse
    Act (CFAA) and emphasize authorized environments only.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for ''Web Application Firewall (WAF) Bypass'' (Category: Cybersecurity
  | Domain: Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking | Subdomain: Penetration Testing Methodology | Entry: 005_Exploitation
  | Security Control Bypass). Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Pentesting > Methodology > Exploitation > Security Control

  CRITICAL: Emphasize ethics in EVERY card - all techniques for AUTHORIZED lab testing ONLY (e.g., DVWA + ModSecurity). Prohibit
  illegal use. Include lab setup notes.


  Research Context: WAFs filter HTTP/HTTPS at Layer 7. Detection: Signature (regex rules), Anomaly (baselines), Behavioral
  (ML patterns). Bypasses: Encoding (URL/Unicode), Case manip, Fragmentation (chunked), Param pollution (?a=1&a=2), Req smuggling
  (CL/TE), Obfuscation (/*comm*/). Tools: Burp Suite. Sources: danger-team.org/waf-bypass, hetmehta.com/Bypassing-Modern-WAF,
  sikasecurity.com/waf-evasion, medium.com/infosecmatrix/waf-bypass-2025.


  Prior Knowledge: HTTP basics, OWASP Top 10 (SQLi/XSS), pentest phases.
