active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given NIST SP 800-63B guidelines (favoring length over composition) and real-world breach data (e.g.,
    RockYou top passwords like '123456'), debate whether mandating password complexity (uppercase, numbers, symbols) is more
    effective than minimum length (12+ characters) against dictionary attacks. Provide evidence, address misconceptions, and
    propose alternatives like passphrases.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., swap offline/online traits), (3) Plausible technical term (e.g., confuse Hashcat mode with brute-force). Base on
    research (e.g., RockYou stats, NIST myths). Ensure distractors teach via correction.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 75 high-quality Anki flashcards

  **Core Content (Web-Researched Summary):** Dictionary attacks use pre-compiled lists (e.g., RockYou: ''123456'', ''password'')
  exploiting predictable passwords. Key: Entropy (randomness), strength (length > complexity per breaches). Brute-force: All
  combos. Offline: Crack hashes (fast, no limits, e.g., MD5 via Hashcat). Online: Login trials (slow, lockouts). Hybrids:
  Rules on dictionaries. Tools: Hashcat (-a 0), John the Ripper. NIST SP 800-63B: Min 8-64 chars, no composition rules, blacklist
  breached/common. Sources: NIST https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html, RockYou https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt,

  **Pedagogy Integration:** Align to Bloom''s: [insert learning_objectives array]. Scaffolding: [insert scaffolding object].
  Active Learning: Inspire cards from [insert active_learning summaries, e.g., debate complexity vs length]. Prior: Hashing/auth
  basics.


  **Flashcard Rules:** Follow exact [flashcard_schema]. Ensure coverage: 20% per layer, proportional to objectives. Varied
  types, misconceptions as distractors. Ethical: Stress lab-only, defenses. Big Picture: Exploitation phase for ethical pentesting.
