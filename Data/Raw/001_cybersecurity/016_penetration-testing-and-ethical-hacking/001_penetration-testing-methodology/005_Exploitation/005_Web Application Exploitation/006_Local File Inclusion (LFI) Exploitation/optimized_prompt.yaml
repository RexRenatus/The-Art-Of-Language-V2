active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group, debate the ethical implications of discovering an LFI vulnerability in a production web application.
    Should it be immediately exploited for proof-of-concept, reported directly to the owner, or handled through a bug bounty
    program? Why? Consider legal, professional, and risk factors.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Core content: LFI tricks web apps into including local server files via unsanitized input (e.g., include($_GET[''page''])).
  Techniques: directory traversal (../), null byte (%00), PHP wrappers (php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd,
  data://text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUWydjbWQnXSk7). Impacts: data leak, RCE. Labs: DVWA, OWASP Juice Shop, PortSwigger.
