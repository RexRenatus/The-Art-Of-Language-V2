active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: You observe a security guard frequently checking their phone and engaging in long conversations with
    non-essential personnel. Categorize this behavior (vulnerability/strength), compare it to PTES Intelligence Gathering
    guidelines, and debate training interventions vs. procedural changes in a group debate.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''random patrols are vulnerable'');
    2) Partial truth (e.g., secure behavior mislabeled); 3) Irrelevant but similar term (e.g., digital recon mixed with physical).
    Ensure one correct answer is unambiguous.'

  Topic: ''Security Guard and Personnel Behavior Observation'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical
  Hacking > Penetration Testing Methodology > 002_Intelligence Gathering and Reconnaissance > Physical and Covert Reconnaissance
  > Security Guard and Personnel Behavior Observation). Use PTES standards (e.g., Intelligence Gathering includes physical
  recon), ethical hacking best practices, and content from scaffolding layers below.


  Learning Objectives: [Insert full list above].

  Active Learning: Incorporate hooks from [discussion_prompt, peer_teaching, problem_solving] in explanations.

  Scaffolding: [Insert full 4 layers above]. Expand with voter inputs: Observation techniques (patrols, badges, responses),
  vulnerable/secure examples, concept map, prerequisites.


  Generate flashcards per schema: [Insert full schema above]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as an object with
  ''type'', ''front'', ''back'', ''explanation'', ''metadata''. Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition,
  progressive complexity. No adult/offensive content; ethical focus only.'
