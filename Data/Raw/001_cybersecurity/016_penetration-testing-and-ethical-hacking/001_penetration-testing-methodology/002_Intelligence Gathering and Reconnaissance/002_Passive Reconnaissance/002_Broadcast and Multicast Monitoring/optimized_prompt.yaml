  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using broadcast/multicast protocols (e.g., mDNS for
    service discovery) in modern networks: How do they enable efficiency but increase reconnaissance risks? Reference RFC
    8386 and NIST SP 800-115, and propose mitigation strategies for defenders.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Base on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse broadcast MAC ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff with multicast 01:00:5e:xx:xx:xx)
    - Use similar protocols (e.g., unicast vs. multicast)
    - 'Include real-world pitfalls (e.g., wrong filter port for LLMNR: 5353 instead of 5355)'
    - 'Vary difficulty: Easy (definition swaps), Hard (scenario misanalysis)'
    - Ensure 70% cards are MCQ with 4 options (1 correct), 30% open-ended

  Content must be complete: Finish NIST SP 800-115 (passive recon via broadcast monitoring for intel without interaction);
  include tools (Wireshark/tcpdump filters), protocols (mDNS/5353, LLMNR/5355, NetBIOS/137, SSDP/1900, ARP/DHCP), examples
  (leaked hostnames in mDNS), RFC 8386 privacy risks, PTES/OSSTMM context.
