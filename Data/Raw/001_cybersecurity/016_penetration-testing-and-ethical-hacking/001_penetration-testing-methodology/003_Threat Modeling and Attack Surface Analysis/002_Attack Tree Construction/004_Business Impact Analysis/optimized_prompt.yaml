  peer_teaching: 'Students pair up: One explains the step-by-step BIA process (identify MEFs, assess impacts, prioritize recovery)
    and key concepts using NISTIR 8286D; the partner teaches it back with their own example from a real-world or hypothetical
    pentest scenario.'
  problem_solving: 'In small groups, conduct a BIA for a hypothetical bank: Identify MEFs (e.g., transaction processing),
    critical assets, risk scenarios, and link outputs to the attack surface from prior threat modeling. Present prioritization
    recommendations for ethical hacking efforts.'

    scanning or pure BC/DR (ignores pentest/impact scope); 2) Mix up MEFs with threats/attack trees; 3) Overemphasize likelihood
    over impact; 4) NIST misattribution (e.g., confuse with NIST CSF). Ensure distractors are realistic for cybersecurity

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing Methodology.\
  \ Topic: Business Impact Analysis (BIA) in the hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration\
  \ Testing Methodology > 005_003_Threat Modeling and Attack Surface Analysis > Attack Tree Construction > Business Impact\
  \ Analysis.\n\nCore Context: BIA identifies MEFs ('what must go right'), critical assets, and impacts, complementing Attack\
  \ Trees ('what might go wrong'). Bridges technical pentesting with business strategy (NISTIR 8286D-upd1). Sources: NISTIR\
  \ 8286D-upd1 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2021/NIST.IR.8286D-upd1.pdf), NIST Cybersecurity Framework (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework).\n\
  \nLearning Objectives (Bloom's): [Insert full list above]. Ensure flashcards target these.\n\nActive Learning Integration:\
  \ Embed prompts referencing discussion (BIA vs. attack trees), peer teaching (NIST steps), problem-solving (bank scenario).\n\
  \nScaffolding: [Insert full 4 layers above]. Distribute flashcards across layers.\n\nBig Picture: Emphasize risk-based prioritization\
  \ for ethical hacking mastery.\n\nFormative Assessments: Include 8-10 MCQs with feedback, reflection prompts (e.g., 'Self-assess\
  \ BIA-attack tree integration').\n\nOutput 25-30 flashcards strictly in this JSON schema per card:\n{\n  'id': 1,\n  'bloom_level':\
  \ 'REMEMBER',\n  'layer': 'Layer 1',\n  'type': 'MCQ',\n  'front': 'Question here? A) Opt1 B) Opt2 C) Opt3 D) Correct',\n\

  \ voter consensus (88.6% approval), web-grounded facts. No generic cards—tailor to pentesting/ethical hacking."
