active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a Zero Trust environment, how does microsegmentation alter traditional DMZ approaches? Debate the
    pros and cons, using real-world examples like the SolarWinds breach to illustrate impacts on lateral movement and attack
    surface reduction.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''DMZ is fully internal''); 2) Partial
    truth (e.g., confuses microseg with VLANs); 3) Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Segmentation eliminates all lateral
    movement''). Ensure plausible for cybersecurity learners; avoid obvious errors.'
