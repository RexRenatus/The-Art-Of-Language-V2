  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the following: ''Should penetration testers always quantify business impacts
    in monetary terms, or is qualitative description sufficient for executive summaries? Use examples from NIST CSF 2.0 and
    real-world breaches to support your position.'' Encourage critical thinking by requiring participants to reference prior
    pentesting phases like vulnerability exploitation.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., confuse BIA with technical vulnerability scanning).

    - Distractor 2: Similar term (e.g., mix ''Mission-Essential Functions'' with ''non-critical assets'').

    - Distractor 3: Partial truth or extreme (e.g., overestimate/underestimate impact without quantification).

    Ensure distractors are plausible based on pentesting context; avoid obvious wrongs.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for university-level cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration
  Testing Methodology. Topic: Business Impact Translation (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking

  Consensus: 87.1% approval.


  Incorporate:

  - Research Context: Business Impact Translation bridges pentest findings to business disruptions. Core: BIA (NISTIR 8286D:
  identify mission-essential functions, critical assets/dependencies, risk scenarios, quantify impacts). NIST CSF 2.0: Taxonomy
  for risk management (Govern, Identify). Sources: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2023/NIST.IR.8286Dd1.pdf (NISTIR 8286D),
