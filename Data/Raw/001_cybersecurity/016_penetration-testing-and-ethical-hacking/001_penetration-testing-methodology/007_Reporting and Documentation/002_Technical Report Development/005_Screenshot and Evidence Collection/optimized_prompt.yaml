active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the real-world consequences of inadequate screenshot evidence collection
    in a penetration test (e.g., report rejection or legal challenges). How do standards like NIST SP 800-86 and SWGDE best
    practices mitigate these risks? Provide examples from ethical hacking scenarios.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Topic: ''Screenshot and Evidence 003_Collection'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking >
  Penetration Testing Methodology > 021_Reporting and Documentation > Technical Report Development > Screenshot and Evidence
  003_Collection). Use provided research: Core concepts (screenshots as evidence, chain of custody, metadata, authentication);
  Standards (NIST SP 800-86, ISO/IEC 27037, SWGDE Best Practices: document context, hash verification, audit logs). Big picture:
  Ensures defensible reports, client trust, legal protection. Concept map: Central ''Screenshot Evidence Collection'' branches
  to Metadata, Chain of Custody, Standards (NIST/ISO/SWGDE), Tools (hashing/timestamps), linked to Reporting.
