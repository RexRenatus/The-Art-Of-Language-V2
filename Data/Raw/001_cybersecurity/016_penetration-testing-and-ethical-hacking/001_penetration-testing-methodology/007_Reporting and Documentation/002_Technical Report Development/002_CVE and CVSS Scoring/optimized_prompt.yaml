  discussion_prompt: 'Debate: Is CVSS sufficient for vulnerability prioritization in pentest reports, or should it be combined
    with other factors like exploitability and business impact? Use a real CVE example like CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell, CVSS
    10.0) to support arguments.'
  peer_teaching: 'In pairs, one partner explains the CVSS v3.1 metric groups (Base: intrinsic; Temporal: time-varying; Environmental:
    organization-specific) using a vulnerability example; the other teach-backs by applying it to a different CVE, addressing
    common misconceptions like confusing Attack Vector with Scope.'
  problem_solving: Given a pentest scenario (e.g., unauthenticated RCE on an internal web server accessible only via VPN),
    use the CVSS v3.1 calculator to score it step-by-step, justify metric choices, and integrate into a sample report finding.
    Compare results with peers.

  Topic: CVE and CVSS Scoring (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration Testing Methodology
  > 021_Reporting and Documentation > Technical Report Development > CVE and CVSS Scoring).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert array above].

  - Active Learning: [insert components above] as hooks.

  - Scaffolding: Generate 5-8 cards per layer [insert layers above], progressing from foundation to integration.

  - Schema: Strictly follow [insert schema above]: Front/Back format, exactly 3 distractors with explanations, Bloom tags,
  sources (e.g., https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1, https://cve.mitre.org/, https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss).


  Content must be complete: Include CVSS v3.1 details (Base/Temporal/Environmental metrics), examples (Log4Shell CVE-2021-44228:
  10.0), pentest report usage, comparisons to v2.0, prioritization.

  Big Picture: CVE/CVSS standardize vuln reporting for remediation prioritization in ethical hacking.


  Generate 25 flashcards in JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''source'':
  ''...'', ''layer'': ''...'', ''hook'': ''...''}}, ...]. Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition friendly,
