active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the value of MTTC as a penetration testing metric compared to MTTD/MTTR
    in SOC operations. Consider scenarios where a low MTTC indicates critical weaknesses despite fast detection—provide evidence
    from real-world breaches (e.g., referencing MITRE ATT&CK frameworks).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors based on common misconceptions: 1) Confusion with SOC metrics (e.g., MTTR instead
    of MTTC); 2) Calculation errors (e.g., include failed tests, wrong formula like median); 3) Terminology mix-ups (e.g.,
    Mean Time to Conclusion); Ensure 60-70% plausibility to challenge learners.'

  Topic: Mean Time to Compromise (MTTC) Calculation (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking >
  Penetration Testing Methodology > 021_Reporting and Documentation > Metrics and Quantification > MTTC Calculation). Note:
  MTTC is context-specific to pen testing (average time for ethical hacker to compromise target across simulations; formula:
  MTTC = Σ(TTC_i)/N successful tests). Distinguish from SOC''s Mean Time to Conclusion; relate to MTTD/MTTR.
