        "core_logic": "Clearing aims to remove data using logical means (like overwriting), making it difficult but potentially recoverable with advanced techniques, whereas purging uses more aggressive methods (like degaussing or block erase) to ensure data is practically unrecoverable.",

        "analogy": "Clearing is like erasing a whiteboard with an eraser (most marks gone, but faint traces might remain). Purging is like using a solvent to dissolve the writing or physically destroying the board (marks are gone permanently)."
