active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a penetration test with explicit rules of engagement allowing post-exploitation, debate the risks
    and benefits of deploying screenshot (T1113) and keylogger (T1056.001) tools versus alternative collection methods like
    clipboard monitoring or audio capture. Use MITRE ATT&CK examples to support your position and consider detection by EDR
    tools.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate plausible distractors based on: 1. Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Keyloggers capture screenshots''
    vs. reality). 2. Related but incorrect MITRE IDs (e.g., T1056.002 instead of T1056.001). 3. Ethical/legal pitfalls (e.g.,
    ''Deploy without RoE''). 4. Technical near-misses (e.g., wrong API: GDI+ vs. BitBlt). Ensure distractors are 70% plausible
    to challenge learners without frustrating.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and
  Ethical Hacking. Topic: Screenshot and Keylogger Deployment (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical
  Hacking > Penetration Testing Methodology > Post-005_Exploitation > Data Exfiltration and 003_Collection > Screenshot and
  Keylogger Deployment). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities, scaffolding layers (including prior
  knowledge and ethics), and research context (MITRE ATT&CK T1113, T1056.001-.004; tools like Metasploit, PowerShell; standards:
  ISO 27001 A.8.16, NIST SP 800-53 AU-3) to generate high-quality, pedagogically optimized flashcards.


  Emphasize ethical use: All content frames these as pen testing tools requiring authorization, RoE, and defensive focus—never
  criminal activity.
