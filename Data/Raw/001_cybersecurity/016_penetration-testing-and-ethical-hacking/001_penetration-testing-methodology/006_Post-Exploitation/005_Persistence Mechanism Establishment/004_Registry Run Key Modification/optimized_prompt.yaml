active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare the stealthiness of Registry Run Key persistence with scheduled tasks or WMI subscriptions. Debate
    scenarios where one method is preferable for red teaming, considering factors like privilege requirements, detectability,
    and execution reliability.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''HKLM requires
    no admin''), 2) Partial truths (e.g., wrong path like HKLM\Run instead of full path), 3) Confusable alternatives (e.g.,
    scheduled task paths), 4) Edge cases (e.g., WOW6432Node vs standard). Ensure distractors teach via explanation.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and
  Ethical Hacking. Topic: Registry Run Key Modification (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking
  > Penetration Testing Methodology > Post-005_Exploitation > Persistence Mechanism Establishment > Registry Run Key Modification).
  Use the provided learning_objectives, active_learning activities, scaffolding_layers (cover all 4 layers evenly), and flashcard_schema.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards (5-7 per Bloom''s level, distributed across layers) optimized for Anki/Quizlet: 60%
  MCQ (with distractors), 20% cloze deletion, 20% short answer/application. Ensure progression: 40% Layer 1-2 (recall/understand),
  40% Layer 3 (apply/analyze), 20% Layer 4 (evaluate/create). Incorporate voter consensus: full Run key paths (HKLM/HKCU Run/RunOnce,
  WOW6432Node), MITRE T1547.001, detection (Autoruns), evasion, lab exercises.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each matching the exact flashcard_schema structure. No extra text. Cover prior knowledge
  (Registry basics, prior post-exploit phases) implicitly in explanations. Make explanations pedagogical with active learning
  ties and formative feedback.'
