        "core_logic": "ARP operates at Layer 2 to resolve IP to MAC addresses on a local segment. If a device responds to ARP (showing it's on the local network) but not to higher-level scans, it implies that its Layer 3 services or specific ports are being protected by filtering or firewalls.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly conclude the device is offline, uses non-standard IP, or is Layer 2 only, failing to recognize that ARP response confirms local presence while scan failure indicates filtering at higher layers.",
