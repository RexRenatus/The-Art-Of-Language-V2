  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical and legal boundaries of SAM database extraction during authorized
    penetration testing versus unauthorized access. Consider real-world scenarios like red team engagements and reference
    MITRE ATT&CK T1003.002. What mitigations would you recommend to defenders?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    only'' vs. registry), 2) Partial truth/mix-up (e.g., wrong RID: 501 for admin), 3) Irrelevant/off-topic (e.g., domain
    controller tool like DCSync). Ensure distractors teach by correcting errors in explanations. Balance: 60% MCQ, 20% Short
    Answer, 20% Cloze.'
