        "core_logic": "Apple's control over both the hardware and software allows for deep integration, enabling features like secure boot, hardware-backed Keychain, and file system encryption. This tight integration simplifies security implementation and ensures that security features are consistently applied across devices, unlike fragmented ecosystems.",
        "distractor_analysis": "iOS is not primarily open-source, it benefits from quick updates rather than supporting old versions, and its limited IPC is a security feature, not a disadvantage.",
