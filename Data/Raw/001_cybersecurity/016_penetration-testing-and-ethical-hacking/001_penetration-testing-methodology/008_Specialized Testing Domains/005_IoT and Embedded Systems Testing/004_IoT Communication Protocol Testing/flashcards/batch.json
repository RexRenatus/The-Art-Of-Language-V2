        "core_logic": "A replay attack exploits the lack of sequence numbers or timestamps in communication protocols because it allows an attacker to capture legitimate messages and resend them later.

        "analogy": "A replay attack is like using a stolen ticket stub to re-enter an event. The stub (captured data) looks valid, and if the venue doesn't check if the ticket has already been used (sequence/timestamp checks), you can get in again."
