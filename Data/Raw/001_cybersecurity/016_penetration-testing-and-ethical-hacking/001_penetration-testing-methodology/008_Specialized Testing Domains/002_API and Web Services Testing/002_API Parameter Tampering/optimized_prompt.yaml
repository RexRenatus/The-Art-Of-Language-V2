active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether parameter tampering should be a standard step in every API pentest,
    considering time constraints, false positives, and differences between REST and GraphQL APIs. Provide real-world examples.
  peer_teaching: Students pair up; one student explains parameter tampering in REST APIs using a live demo (e.g., via Postman
    on JSONPlaceholder), while the partner teaches back the differences in GraphQL (e.g., tampering with variables or arguments)
    and quizzes the first student on OWASP-related risks.
  problem_solving: Using a mock vulnerable API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder or a local DVWA API), students tamper parameters to
    bypass Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), such as changing 'user_id=123' to 'user_id=456' to retrieve unauthorized
    data. Debrief on observed vulnerabilities and mitigations like proper authorization checks.

  **Topic:** API Parameter Tampering

  **Category:** Cybersecurity | Domain: Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking | Subdomain: Penetration Testing Methodology
  | Entry: 008_Specialized Testing Domains | API and Web Services Testing | Level 6: API Parameter Tampering.


  **Research Context:** API parameter tampering intercepts/modifies params (query/header/body) to test vulns like BOLA (tamper
  user_id for unauthorized access), Mass Assignment (add fields), Excessive Data Exposure. Common in REST (URI params), GraphQL
  (variables), SOAP (XML). Tools: Burp Suite for intercept/tamper. Relates to OWASP API Sec Top 10 (API1 BOLA, API3 Property
  Auth, API6 Sensitive Data).

  **Active Learning (inspire scenario cards):** [insert descriptions from ''active_learning'' above]


  **Scaffolding Layers (content source for flashcards):** [insert full ''scaffolding'' object above]


  **Flashcard Generation Schema:** Strictly follow [insert full ''flashcard_schema'' above]. Ensure completeness (OWASP risks,
  examples like ''user_id=123'' to ''456''), prerequisites (HTTP/Burp), concrete attacks.
