        {
          "text": "CIS certifications are the only reliable source for compliance mappings in SCC.",

          "text": "CIS certifications mean that SCC automatically enforces compliance.",

        "core_logic": "CIS certification provides a level of validation for how SCC detectors align with established security benchmarks, offering confidence in the accuracy of compliance assessments for those specific mappings.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly claim exclusivity, automatic enforcement, or irrelevance of CIS certifications, misunderstanding their role in validating detector-to-benchmark alignment.",
        "analogy": "A CIS certification for a detector mapping is like a 'Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval' for that specific alignment; it indicates rigorous review and reliability for that particular check."
