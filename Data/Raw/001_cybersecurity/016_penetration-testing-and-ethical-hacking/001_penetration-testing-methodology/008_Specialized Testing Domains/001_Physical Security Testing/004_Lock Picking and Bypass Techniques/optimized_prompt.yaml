  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Lock Picking and Bypass Techniques'' (Category: Cybersecurity, Domain:
  Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking, Subdomain: Penetration Testing Methodology, Entry: 008_Specialized Testing Domains
  > 006_004_Physical Security Testing). Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Penetration
  Testing Methodology > 008_Specialized Testing Domains > 006_004_Physical Security Testing > Lock Picking and Bypass Techniques.


  Core Research Context: Lock picking opens locks without keys by manipulating components (e.g., pins); bypassing exploits
  designs (shimming, bumping). Frame within ethical hacking/physical pentesting (CAPEC-391: Bypassing Physical Locks). Emphasize:
  ONLY authorized testing; legal permission required; simulations/videos/dummy locks only; consequences of misuse.

  Ethics Mandate: Every flashcard reinforces ''ethical, permission-based pentesting only; laws vary by jurisdiction; misuse
  illegal.'' Avoid detailed criminal how-tos; focus on concepts, vulnerabilities, reporting.


  Output 50 flashcards as a JSON array, each following this EXACT schema: {''type'': ''Q&A|MCQ|Cloze'', ''question'': ''...'',
  ''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''d1'', ''d2'', ''d3''] (omit if not MCQ)}. Ensure spaced
  repetition optimization: concise questions, vivid answers, layered difficulty per Bloom''s.'
