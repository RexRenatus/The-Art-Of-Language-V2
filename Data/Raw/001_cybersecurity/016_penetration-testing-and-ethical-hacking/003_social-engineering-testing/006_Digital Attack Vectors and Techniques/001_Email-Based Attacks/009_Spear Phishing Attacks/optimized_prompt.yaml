system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 20-30 high-quality flashcards\
  \ on 'Spear Phishing Attacks' (Category: Cybersecurity, Domain: Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking, Subdomain: Social\
  \ Engineering Testing, Entry: 007_Digital Attack Vectors and Techniques > Email-Based Attacks). Use the provided topic hierarchy,\
  \ research context, and pedagogical elements.\n\n**Incorporate:**\n- Learning objectives (one per Bloom's level: Remember,\
  \ Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create).\n- Scaffolding layers (5 flashcards per layer: Foundation, Components,\
  \ Implementation, Integration).\n- Active learning: Include 2-3 flashcards as scenarios from discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving\
  \ activities.\n- Concept map integration: Flashcards linking spear phishing to phishing, social engineering, risks (malware\
  \ deployment: ransomware/trojans causing compromise; data breach; disruption), defenses.\n- Full content: Definitions, steps,\
  \ risks (complete malware: deployment via attachments/links leading to persistence, lateral movement), mitigations, cases\
  \ (DNC, SolarWinds), sources (sprocketsecurity.com, eccouncil.com, cisa.gov Phishing Guidance).\n\n**Output Format (JSON\
  \ array of flashcards):**\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"bloom_level\": \"REMEMBER\",\n    \"scaffolding_layer\": 1,\n \
