  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the effectiveness of clone phishing as an advanced persistent threat (APT)
    tactic in modern red teaming. Consider: How does it build on basic phishing knowledge? What defenses make it harder to
    detect than generic phishing? Support with real-world examples like APT campaigns.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Topic: **Clone Phishing** (Category: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Social Engineering Testing
  > 007_Digital Attack Vectors and Techniques > Email-Based Attacks > Clone Phishing). Consensus: 82.9% approval.


  **Content Summary (Web-Grounded, Completed):** Clone phishing replicates a legitimate prior email, modifying with malicious
  payload to exploit trust. Core: Social engineering tactic. Steps: 1) Access legit emails. 2) Clone (HTML/sender). 3) Weaponize
  link/attachment. 4) Send spoofed. 5) Exploit. Big picture: APT/red team tool. Detection: DMARC, hover links, training. Ethics:
  Scoped pentests only. Sources: Kaspersky.com, AdaptiveSecurity.com, case studies (APT29). Prior knowledge: Builds on phishing/spear
  phishing.


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full array from ''learning_objectives''].

  - Scaffolding: Strictly 4 layers [Insert full scaffolding details].

  - Active Learning: Infuse prompts linking to [discussion_prompt], [peer_teaching_activity], [problem_solving_exercise].

  - Concept Map: Central ''Clone Phishing'' → branches as in Layer 2.
