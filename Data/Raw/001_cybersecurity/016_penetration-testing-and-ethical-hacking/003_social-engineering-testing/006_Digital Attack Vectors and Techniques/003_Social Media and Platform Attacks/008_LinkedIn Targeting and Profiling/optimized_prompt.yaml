active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the balance between the value of LinkedIn OSINT for ethical penetration
    testing and the potential for misuse in real-world social engineering attacks. Provide examples from LinkedIn's targeting
    attributes (e.g., seniority, skills) and reference ISO 27001 controls for social engineering awareness.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    with Facebook behavioral ads); (2) Partial truths (e.g., valid attribute but wrong context like ''personal interests''

    Twitter trends vs. LinkedIn seniority). Ensure distractors teach by contrast.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and\
  \ Ethical Hacking. Topic: LinkedIn Targeting and Profiling (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking\
  \ > Social Engineering Testing > 007_Digital Attack Vectors and Techniques > Social Media and Platform Attacks > LinkedIn\
  \ Targeting and Profiling). Reframe LinkedIn's ad targeting (from business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/targeting) to\
  \ ethical hacker perspective: OSINT reconnaissance, target profiling for social engineering (e.g., job title, company, seniority\
  \ for phishing vectors).\n\nIncorporate:\n- Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST ABOVE]\n- Active Learning: Use for inspiration\
