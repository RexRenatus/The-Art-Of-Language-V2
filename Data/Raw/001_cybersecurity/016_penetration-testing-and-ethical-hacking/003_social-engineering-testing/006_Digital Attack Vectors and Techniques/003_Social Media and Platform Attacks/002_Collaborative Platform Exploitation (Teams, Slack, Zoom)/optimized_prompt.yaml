active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how social engineering integrates with technical exploits on platforms
    like Zoom (e.g., bombing via shared links) and evaluate whether Zero Trust fully addresses user-behavior vulnerabilities.
    Support arguments with PTES phases and real-world CVEs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and
  Ethical Hacking. Topic: Collaborative Platform 005_Exploitation (Teams, Slack, Zoom). Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration
  Testing And Ethical Hacking > Social Engineering Testing > 007_Digital Attack Vectors and Techniques > Social Media and
  Platform Attacks > Collaborative Platform 005_Exploitation (Teams, Slack, Zoom).


  Use this COMPLETE research context: Exploitation in pen testing leverages vulns for unauthorized access on Teams (OAuth
  token theft via misconfig apps, e.g., CVE-2023-29323), Slack (app vulns like slash command injection/RCE, e.g., CVE-2023-33832),
  Zoom (SDK exploits, bombing via shared links). PTES: 7 phases - Pre-engagement, Intelligence Gathering (prereq), Threat
  Modeling, Vulnerability Analysis (prereq), Exploitation (gain access), Post-Exploitation, Reporting. Zero Trust: Never Trust
  Always Verify; Assume Breach (necessitates continuous verification, least privilege). Builds on prior phases.


  Incorporate: Learning objectives [insert array above]; Active learning [insert components above for context/enrichment];
  Scaffolding layers [insert array above - generate 8-12 cards per layer, progressive].


  Generate 40 flashcards (10 per layer). Follow EXACT schema: JSON array of objects with ''front'', ''back'', ''bloom_level'',
  ''layer'', ''type'' (MCQ/Cloze/etc.). Use distractor protocol. Ensure university pedagogy: spaced repetition friendly, active
  recall. Voter consensus: 84.3% approval on completeness/pedagogy. Output ONLY the JSON array.'
