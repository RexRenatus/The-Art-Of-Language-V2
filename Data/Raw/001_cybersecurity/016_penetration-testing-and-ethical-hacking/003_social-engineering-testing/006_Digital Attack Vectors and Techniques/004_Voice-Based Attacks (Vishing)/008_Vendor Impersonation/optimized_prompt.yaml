active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the relative effectiveness of voice-based vendor impersonation (vishing)
    versus email-based VEC/BEC attacks. Consider factors like detection difficulty, response time, and psychological manipulation
    tactics. Support arguments with real-world examples from cybersecurity reports.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ:

    - Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., confuse VEC with BEC scope).

    - Distractor 2: Similar term/ technique (e.g., phishing vs. vishing).

    - Distractor 3: Partial truth or edge case (e.g., email tactic in vishing context).

    Ensure distractors are web-grounded (e.g., from MITRE ATT&CK or TechTarget) and promote critical thinking.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and
  Ethical Hacking. Topic: ''Vendor Impersonation'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Social
  Engineering Testing > 007_Digital Attack Vectors and Techniques > Voice-Based Attacks (Vishing) > Vendor Impersonation).
  Use the provided learning objectives, active learning components, scaffolding layers (4 layers exactly), and flashcard schema
  to generate high-quality, pedagogically optimized flashcards.


  Incorporate university-style pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy progression, active learning prompts, scaffolding from foundation
  to integration. Base content on voter consensus (voice-focused vishing, complete attack steps, pen testing emphasis) and
  research (VEC: vendor impersonation via email; BEC: broader CEO fraud; adapt to voice with spoofing/urgency).


  Output ONLY in JSON: {''flashcards'': [array of objects, each {''front'': ''question + options'', ''back'': ''answer + explanation''}
  ] }. Generate 40-50 cards, 10 per layer. Strictly follow schema: MCQs with distractors, explanations tying to objectives/layers/active
  learning. No additional text.'
