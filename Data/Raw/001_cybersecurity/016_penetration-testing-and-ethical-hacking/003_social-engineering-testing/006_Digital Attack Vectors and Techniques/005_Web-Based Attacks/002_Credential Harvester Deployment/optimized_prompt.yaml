active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical dilemmas of credential harvesting in penetration testing (e.g.,
    balancing realism with misuse prevention). Propose three safeguards to ensure deployments remain authorized and reference
    real-world cases like SolarWinds credential theft.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
