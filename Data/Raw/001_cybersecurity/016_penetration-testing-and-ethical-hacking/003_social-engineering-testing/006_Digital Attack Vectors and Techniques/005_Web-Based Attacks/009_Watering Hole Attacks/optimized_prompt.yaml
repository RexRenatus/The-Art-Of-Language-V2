  Use this comprehensive research context:


  Watering Hole Attacks: Sophisticated cyberattacks compromising legitimate websites frequented by targets to deliver malware.
  Key Characteristics: Targeted (specific audience), Stealthy (leverages trust), Uses zero-days/exploits, Multi-stage (profiling
  > site ID > compromise > infection).

  Workflow: 1) Profile targets (e.g., finance employees visit Bloomberg). 2) Compromise site via vuln. 3) Inject malware/exploit
  kit. 4) Victims infect devices.

  Real-world: Operation Aurora (2010), RSA SecurID (2011 via defense sites). Detection: Traffic anomalies, EDR, AV. Mitigations:
  Patching, web filters (e.g., DNS RPZ), training, zero-trust.

  Sources: MITRE ATT&CK T1189 (Drive-by Compromise/Watering Hole), Kaspersky Blog, DarkReading, RSA Incident Report.

  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards per the schema: Balance across Bloom''s (5-6 per level), layers (7-8 per layer), types
  (MCQs 40%, etc.).

  For MCQs: Follow distractor protocol strictly.

  Each card must tie to objectives/layers, include explanations addressing misconceptions, and promote active recall.

  Output ONLY a JSON array: [{''front'': ''Question text'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'':
  ''...'', ''source'': ''...'', ''active_learning_link'': ''...''}}, ...]. No extra text.'
