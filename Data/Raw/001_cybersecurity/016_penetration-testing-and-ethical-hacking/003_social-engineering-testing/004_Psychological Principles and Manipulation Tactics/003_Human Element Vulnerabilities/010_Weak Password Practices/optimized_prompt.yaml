active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between password usability (e.g., memorability) and security
    (e.g., length and entropy). Use real-world breach examples like the 2013 Yahoo hack to support arguments, and propose
    how NIST guidelines balance these factors.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Distractors must be plausible but incorrect (e.g., common myths like 'complexity > length' for NIST critiques)
    - Base on real weak practices or outdated guidelines (e.g., 'Change passwords every 90 days' as distractor)
    - 'Vary difficulty: 1 easy (obvious error), 1 medium (partial truth), 1 hard (subtle misconception)'
    - Ensure no distractor is correct; test for ambiguity
    quantity: 3 per MCQ flashcard
    coverage: Distribute across scaffolding layers and Bloom's levels

  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives**: [Insert the full ''learning_objectives'' array above].

  - **Active Learning**: Use concepts from discussions, peer teaching, and problem-solving for contextual flashcards.

  - **Scaffolding Layers**: [Insert the full ''scaffolding_layers'' array above]. Distribute flashcards progressively.

  - **Key Content**: Definitions (weak password, entropy); Attacks (brute-force, dictionary, phishing, social engineering);
  NIST SP 800-63B (2017, https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html): Favor length (>=8 chars, passphrases) over composition
  rules, no periodic changes, screen common/breached passwords (e.g., Have I Been Pwned: https://haveibeenpwned.com/), rate
  limiting, password managers. Other sources: OWASP Password Storage (https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html).

  - **Flashcard Schema**: Strictly follow [Insert the full ''flashcard_schema'' above]. Generate 50 flashcards: 20 MCQ with
  distractors, 15 cloze/short answer, 15 scenario-based.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"type": "mcq/cloze/short", "layer": 1-4, "bloom": "Remember/etc.", "front":
  "...", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "hints": ["..."], "sources": ["..."]}}. Ensure high pedagogical quality,
  accuracy (no outdated NIST info), and engagement for university-level learners.'
