  Incorporate this research context: In social engineering pen testing, decision-making under pressure involves rapid choices
  amid stress, using psych tactics like urgency (scarcity principle), authority, reciprocity to induce target compliance in
  phishing/pretexting. PTES 7 phases: 1. Pre-engagement Interactions (scope psych profiles), 2. Intelligence Gathering (behavioral
  intel), 3. Threat Modeling (psych threat paths), 4. Vulnerability Analysis (cognitive weaknesses), 5. Exploitation (manipulation
  under time limits), 6. Post-Exploitation (escalate via compliance), 7. Reporting (decision debrief). Align to behavioral
  psych: stress biases rapid decisions for testers/targets. Sources: PTES (pentest-standard.org), ''Social Engineering: The
  Art of Human Hacking'' (Hadnagy), SANS SEC566, NIST SP 800-115, Cialdini ''Influence''.
