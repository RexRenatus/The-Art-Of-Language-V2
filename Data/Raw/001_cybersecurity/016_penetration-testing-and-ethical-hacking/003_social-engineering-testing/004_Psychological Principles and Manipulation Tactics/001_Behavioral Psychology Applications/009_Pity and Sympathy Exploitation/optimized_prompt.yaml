active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the fine line between using pity/sympathy in ethical pentesting (e.g.,
    approved pretexting) versus malicious scams (e.g., fake emergency vishing). Provide examples and evaluate potential psychological
    harm to targets.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Base on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse pity with authority: ''Orders from boss'' vs. ''Help sick family'')'
    - 'Include plausible alternatives (e.g., similar tactics: urgency=''Time-sensitive deal'' vs. sympathy=''Family emergency'')'
    - Add partial truths (e.g., 'Sympathy builds rapport' but distractor ignores defense bypass)
    - 'Ensure distractors promote analysis (e.g., reverse psych: ''Pity increases skepticism'')'

  \ Ethical Hacking > Social Engineering Testing > Psychological Principles > Pity and Sympathy Exploitation.\n\n**Topic Context:**\
  \ In social engineering, pity evokes sorrow for suffering (e.g., 'Help my dying pet'), sympathy shares distress (e.g., 'I'm\
  \ stranded abroad') to exploit empathy, bypassing defenses. Real examples: Phishing sob stories, vishing 'grandparent scams',\
  \ PTES pre-engagement pretexts. Psych basis: Empathy triggers reciprocity.\n\n**Hierarchy:** Cybersecurity > Penetration\
  \ Testing And Ethical Hacking > Social Engineering Testing > 005_Psychological Principles and Manipulation Tactics > Behavioral\
  \ Psychology Applications > Pity and Sympathy 005_Exploitation.\n\n**Pedagogy Integration:**\n- Align flashcards to these\
  \ Bloom's objectives: [INSERT LEARNING_OBJECTIVES ARRAY HERE].\n- Scaffold across layers: [INSERT SCAFFOLDING ARRAY HERE].\n\
  - Embed active learning hooks (e.g., 'How would you discuss this in a peer teach?').\n\n**Output Format:** JSON array of\
