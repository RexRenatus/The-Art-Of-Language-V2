        "core_logic": "When an attacker leverages perceived authority (e.g., claiming to be from HR with a bonus offer), the financial incentive becomes more potent because the target is more likely to trust the offer and act upon it, since authority figures are often perceived as credible.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly state that authority figures are immune, that authority and incentives are exclusive, or that the amount of money defines authority.",
