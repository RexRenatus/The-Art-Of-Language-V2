active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent should penetration testers use social media profiling? Debate the ethical boundaries,
    privacy concerns vs. security benefits, using real-world examples like celebrity hacks (e.g., Twitter account compromises)
    or corporate breaches (e.g., LinkedIn data used in spear-phishing campaigns).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Topic Content (Full Synthesized):** Social media profiling is passive OSINT reconnaissance aggregating public data from
  LinkedIn (professional: jobs, connections), Facebook (personal: family, events, photos), Twitter (opinions, real-time activity)
  to build target profiles for social engineering. Categories: Personal (routines, interests); Professional (history, colleagues);
  Technical (OS/software mentions, e.g., ''Using macOS Ventura and Wireshark''); Connections (networks). Ethical: Public data
  only, fictional practice. Vectors: Phishing via hobbies/colleagues. Sources: sentinelone.com/blog/osint-social-media-profiling/,
  osintframework.com, linkedin.com/learning/osint.


  **Incorporate:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste full list from JSON]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [Paste full descriptions from JSON] (5-7 cards per layer)

  - Active Learning: Tie cards to discussion/activities (e.g., scenario cards for problem-solving)

  - Ensure 40% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 30% APPLY/ANALYZE, 30% EVALUATE/CREATE


  **Output Format:** JSON array of 25 flashcards, each as: {"front": "...", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...",
  "distractors": ["...","...","..."]}, "metadata": {...}}. Strictly follow flashcard_schema. Vary types: 10 definitions, 10
  MCQ, 5 application scenarios. Emphasize ethics, completeness (technical info included).'
