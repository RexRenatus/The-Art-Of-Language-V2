  peer_teaching: 'Pair up: Student A demonstrates IP geolocation extraction using ipinfo.io or MaxMind on sample IPs and explains
    accuracy limitations; Student B shows EXIF metadata extraction from an image using exiftool and maps it. Switch roles,
    then group share insights.'
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: Provided a screenshot of a target''s Twitter profile with a geotagged photo and associated domain/IP.
    Passively extract geolocation data using free tools (e.g., Creepy, IntelTechniques, WHOIS), plot on a map, and discuss
    how it builds a target footprint. Extend to report potential risks.'

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ cards (30% of total): Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g.,
    ''Active scanning is passive recon'' for passive techniques), related but incorrect concepts (e.g., ''Port scanning''
    vs. ''WHOIS''), or partial truths (e.g., ''IP geolocation is always precise to street level''). Ensure one distractor
    is a frequent error from research (e.g., overestimating EXIF reliability).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and
  Ethical Hacking. Topic: Geolocation Data Extraction (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking
  > Social Engineering Testing > 002_Information Gathering and Reconnaissance > Passive Reconnaissance Techniques > Geolocation
  Data Extraction). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities, 4-layer scaffolding, voter priorities
  (e.g., completeness with tools like MaxMind, EXIF, Creepy; sources like PTES), and web research (definitions, PTES context)
  to generate high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized flashcards.


  Incorporate university pedagogy: Progress Bloom''s Taxonomy; active recall; scaffolding from foundation to integration.
  Ensure completeness: Cover IP geolocation (MaxMind/IP2Location/ipinfo.io), EXIF extraction (exiftool), social geotags, WHOIS;
  best practices (proxies, verification); ethics (privacy, Cambridge Analytica); prior knowledge (OSINT, IP basics).


  Generate exactly 60 flashcards following the schema: [{''id'': int, ''type'': ''basic|cloze|mcq'', ''front'': str, ''back'':
  str, ''explanation'': str (detailed, with Bloom''s, layer, context), ''tags'': array (e.g., [''layer1'', ''remember'', ''definition'']),
  ''distractors'': array of 3 (MCQ only)}]. Balance: 20 basic/cloze (Layer1-2, remember/understand), 25 application (Layer3,
  apply/analyze with tool steps), 15 evaluation/create (Layer4, ethics/integration). Vary difficulty; include real tool commands,
  scenarios from active learning. Output ONLY the JSON array.'
