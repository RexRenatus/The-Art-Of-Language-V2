active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the risks and benefits of using custom scripts versus off-the-shelf tools (e.g., SET or Gophish)
    in social engineering tests, citing specific PTES phases like Intelligence Gathering and Exploitation. Consider factors
    such as customization, maintainability, detection risks, and ethical implications.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MC cards: 1. Common misconception (e.g., ''Custom scripts replace
    PTES entirely'' vs. augment), 2. Partial truth (e.g., ''Python only for web exploits'' ignoring SE automation), 3. Off-topic
    (e.g., general pentest tool like Nmap). Ensure one is highly tempting based on voter priorities (e.g., generic pentest
    vs. SE-specific).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and
  Ethical Hacking. Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on ''Custom Script Development'' in the subdomain ''Social Engineering
  Frameworks'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Social Engineering Testing > 004_Technical
  Tools and Platforms > Social Engineering Frameworks > Custom Script Development).


  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives** (span Bloom''s): [Paste full learning_objectives array here].

  - **Active Learning** for context: [Paste active_learning here]; inspire cards that prep for these (e.g., debate-style analysis
  Qs).

  - **Scaffolding Layers**: Distribute cards evenly (12-13 per layer): [Paste scaffolding_layers here].

  - **Content Sources**: PTES (7 phases: Pre-engagement, Intelligence Gathering, Threat Modeling, Vulnerability Analysis,
  Exploitation, Post-Exploitation, Reporting); SET (Social-Engineer Toolkit for phishing/sms/vishing); Gophish/King Phisher;
  Tailor to SE (phishing automation, OSINT pretexting). OWASP WSTG (v4.2: relevant for SE web payloads, e.g., client-side
  testing). Prerequisites: Python/Bash. Risks: Ethics, detection. Concept Map: Custom Script Dev → PTES/SE Frameworks/Languages.


  **Output Format**: Strictly JSON array of 50 flashcards, each matching this schema: [Paste flashcard_schema.structure here].
  Ensure progression: 20% Remember/Understand (Layer 1), 30% Apply/Analyze (Layers 2-3), 50% Evaluate/Create (Layer 4). 40%
  MC (w/ distractors per protocol), 30% Cloze, 30% Short Answer. Varied: 30% code snippets, 20% SE scenarios, 20% comparisons,
  10% critiques, 20% PTES/SET integrations. Make engaging, accurate, SE-focused (no general exploits).'
