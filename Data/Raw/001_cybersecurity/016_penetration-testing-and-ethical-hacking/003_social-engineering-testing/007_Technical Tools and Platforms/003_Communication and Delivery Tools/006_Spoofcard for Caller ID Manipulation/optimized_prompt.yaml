  discussion_prompt: 'In a group debate, argue the pros and cons of using tools like Spoofcard in penetration testing: Does
    the potential for ethical insights outweigh the risks of misuse? Support your position with references to legal frameworks
    (e.g., Truth in Caller ID Act) and real-world defenses like STIR/SHAKEN.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
