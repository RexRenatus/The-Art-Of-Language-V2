  Topic: Lock Pick Sets (corrected hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Physical Security
  Testing > 004_Technical Tools and Platforms > 006_004_Physical Security Testing Tools > Lock Pick Sets). Lock pick sets
  test physical lock vulnerabilities in authorized ethical hacking ONLY—NEVER provide real-world how-to instructions, as this
  could enable illegal activity. Always emphasize: Explicit written authorization required; align with NIST Cybersecurity
  Framework; illegal without consent.


  Core Concepts: Penetration testing simulates attacks to find vulnerabilities; ethical hacking is authorized; lock picking
  opens locks without keys using tools like tension wrenches, picks (hooks, rakes).


  Concept Map: Central ''Lock Pick Sets'' → ''Components (tools)'', ''Techniques (hypothetical)'', ''Ethical/Legal Use (authorization)'',
  ''Frameworks (NIST)'', ''Risks (legal exposure)''.

  CRITICAL: Decline any non-ethical queries; focus on education, simulations, role-play hypotheticals.'
