  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the role of WiFi Pineapple in the full penetration testing lifecycle (per
    PTES): How does it bridge wireless auditing with social engineering? What are the biggest risks if misused, and how can
    ethical hackers mitigate them?'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors: 1 common misconception (e.g., confuse PineAP with wired tool), 1 partial truth (e.g.,
      correct feature but wrong context), 1 unrelated but similar term (e.g., mix with Metasploit).'
    - Ensure distractors are realistic based on web research/Hak5 docs.
