  discussion_prompt: 'Compare OWASP WSTG reporting guidelines (adapted for awareness testing) with NIST SP 800-50 and PTES
    pre-engagement reporting requirements: Which is more effective for evaluating non-technical employee reporting in social
    engineering tests, and why? Debate pros/cons considering stakeholder audiences like executives vs. security teams.'

    - '3-4 options for MCQ: 1 correct, 2-3 plausible distractors (common misconceptions, e.g., confuse pentester report with
      employee reporting; edge cases like high false positives).'
    - Base distractors on real standards (e.g., NIST vs. outdated metrics; OWASP web-only vs. social eng).
    - Avoid obvious wrongs; ensure 60% plausibility to promote active recall.
    - 'For open-ended: Suggest 2 common errors in explanation.'
