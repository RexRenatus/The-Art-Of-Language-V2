active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a penetration testing scenario involving social engineering, analyze how device security policies
    like those in NIST SP 800-124 could be bypassed or strengthened. Debate real-world examples where weak policies led to
    breaches (e.g., phishing via unsecured mobile devices, such as the 2020 Twitter Bitcoin scam enabled by poor device access
    controls).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions, outdated standards, or related but incorrect
      concepts (e.g., for NIST SP 800-124 component: correct=''remote wipe''; distractors=''local delete'', ''password reset'',
      ''firmware update'').'
    - Ensure distractors are 70% similar to correct answer in wording/context to challenge understanding.
    - Avoid obvious wrongs; base on real-world errors (e.g., confusing BYOD with corporate devices).
    - 'Balance: 40% basic/cloze, 60% MCQ across set.'
    coverage: '20-30 flashcards: 4-5 per Bloom''s level, 5 per scaffolding layer, spanning all objectives.'

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet:

  - Cover all Bloom''s levels (4-5 cards each), scaffolding layers (5-7 each), and objectives.

  - 40% basic Q&A, 20% cloze, 40% MCQ.

  - Follow EXACT flashcard_schema structure and distractor_protocol.

  - Make questions active/measurable (e.g., ''List 3 components...'' not ''What is...'').

  - Explanations: 2-4 sentences, tie to pentesting/social engineering, include why distractors fail.
