active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given the rise in remote work post-COVID, debate how social engineering threats (e.g., phishing, pretexting,
    impersonation in video calls) evolve in telework scenarios. Using NIST SP 800-46 Rev 2, compare office vs. remote security
    policies and propose countermeasures for penetration testers assessing policies. Reference real-world examples like SolarWinds
    or COVID-era breaches.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives:** [Paste full learning_objectives array here].

  - **Active Learning:** Use to inspire higher-order questions (e.g., debate-style analysis).

  - **Scaffolding Layers:** Distribute flashcards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4.

  - **Research Context:** NIST SP 800-46 Rev 2 (2016): Guide to Enterprise Telework, Remote Access, BYOD Security. Key: Telework
  definitions, VPN/remote access, BYOD risks, threat models. Sources: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-46r2.pdf;
  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-46/rev-2/final. Tie to social engineering (phishing on home networks, video
  call impersonation).

  - **Concept Map:** Central: Remote Work Security Guidelines → NIST SP 800-46 → Telework/BYOD/Threats → Social Engineering
  Links.
