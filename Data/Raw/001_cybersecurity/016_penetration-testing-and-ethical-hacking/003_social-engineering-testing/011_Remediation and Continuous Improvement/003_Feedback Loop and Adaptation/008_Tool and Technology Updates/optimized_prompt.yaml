  peer_teaching: 'Pair students: One researches and teaches the update process for Gophish based on pentest feedback (e.g.,
    failed campaign due to outdated templates), while the other takes notes and quizzes the teacher with scenario-based questions.
    Switch roles for SET, fostering active recall and explanation skills.'
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A social engineering pentest report shows 80% of phishing emails via Gophish were blocked by
    DKIM/SPF. In teams, solve by proposing tool updates (e.g., switch to AI-enhanced evasion kits), testing steps in a lab
    simulation, and justifying alignment with feedback loop best practices. Present solutions and peer-review for feasibility.'

  Incorporate these LEARNING OBJECTIVES (span Bloom''s Taxonomy):

  1. REMEMBER: Recall at least five key tools... [paste all 6 objectives].


  Use SCAFFOLDING LAYERS for coverage:

  - Layer 1 Foundation: [paste full descriptions].

  - Layer 2 Components: [...]

  - Layer 3 Implementation: [...]

  - Layer 4 Integration: [...]


  Distribute flashcards: 6-8 per layer, progressing cognitive load (start with REMEMBER in Layer 1, end with CREATE in Layer
  4).


  ACTIVE LEARNING INTEGRATION: Phrase questions to evoke discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving (e.g., scenario-based for
  application).


  FOLLOW FLASHCARD SCHEMA STRICTLY: [paste full schema]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 25-30 flashcards, e.g., [{''front'':
  ''...'', ''back'': {...}}, ...]. Base content on voter priorities (focus on social eng tool updates via feedback, e.g.,
  SET/Gophish evolutions, AI threats, MITRE ATT&CK), web research (PTES feedback loops adapted to tools), and best practices
  (plausible distractors, explanations with examples like post-phishing test updates).'
