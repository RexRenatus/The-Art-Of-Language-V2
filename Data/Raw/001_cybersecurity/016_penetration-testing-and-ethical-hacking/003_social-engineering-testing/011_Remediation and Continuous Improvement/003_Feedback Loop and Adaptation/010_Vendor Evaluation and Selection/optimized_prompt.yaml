active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a debate format, argue whether certifications like OSCP or CEH are more critical than real-world experience
    when selecting a penetration testing vendor for social engineering assessments. Provide evidence from industry breaches
    (e.g., successful social engineering exploits) or vendor successes, and connect to remediation feedback loops.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  5: Feedback Loop and Adaptation > Level 6: Vendor Evaluation and Selection). Cover all Bloom''s levels via these objectives:
  [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY]. Incorporate active learning: [INSERT active_learning JSON]. Use 4-layer scaffolding:
  [INSERT scaffolding JSON]. Ensure even distribution: 10 cards Layer 1/Remember-Understand, 10 Layer 2/Apply-Analyze, 10
  Layer 3/Evaluate, 10 Layer 4/Create-Integration. Integrate research context: Definitions (pen testing, ethical hacking,
  VAPT), types (network/app/social eng/wireless), criteria (methodology, expertise/certs: OSCP/CEH/CREST, pricing/references/contracts),
  standards (NIST/OWASP/PCI-DSS), process (RFP/PoC/feedback). Follow exact flashcard schema: [INSERT flashcard_schema JSON].
  Output ONLY a JSON array of 40 flashcards, no extra text. Vary question types (e.g., ''List key criteria'', ''Compare OSCP
  vs CEH'', ''Evaluate mock proposal''). Make challenging for pen testing pros.'
