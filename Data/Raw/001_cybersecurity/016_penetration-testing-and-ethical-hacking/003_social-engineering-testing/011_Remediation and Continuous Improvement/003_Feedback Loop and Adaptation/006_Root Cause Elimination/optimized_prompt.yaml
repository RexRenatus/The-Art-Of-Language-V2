active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the differences between treating symptoms (e.g., blocking a phishing email)
    and eliminating root causes (e.g., updating verification protocols) in social engineering tests. Provide real-world examples
    from penetration testing reports and evaluate how root cause elimination contributes to the feedback loop in continuous
    improvement.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    engineering examples (e.g., ''training'' as distractor if root is policy). Ensure distractors are realistic for intermediate

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and
  Ethical Hacking. Topic: Root Cause Elimination (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Social
  Engineering Testing > 011_Remediation and Continuous Improvement > Feedback Loop and Adaptation > Root Cause Elimination).
  Use this research context: Root cause elimination identifies/fixes fundamental flaws beyond symptoms, per NIST SP 800-61
  Rev. 2 (Computer Security Incident Handling Guide: phases include analysis for root causes, post-incident lessons). Tailor
  to social engineering (e.g., phishing root cause: training gaps; vishing: verification lacks). Prior knowledge: Basic pen
  testing vulns, social eng attacks.
