    rules:
    - Plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse psych safety with 'general trust' or 'physical safety').
    - 'Tailored to pen testing (e.g., distractor: ''Punishing minor config errors'' vs. correct: ''Admitting overlooked vulns'').'
    - 1 semi-correct (partial truth), 1 opposite, 1 unrelated.
    - 3-4 distractors max, ensure 20-30% cards are MCQ.
    - Avoid giving away via wording.
