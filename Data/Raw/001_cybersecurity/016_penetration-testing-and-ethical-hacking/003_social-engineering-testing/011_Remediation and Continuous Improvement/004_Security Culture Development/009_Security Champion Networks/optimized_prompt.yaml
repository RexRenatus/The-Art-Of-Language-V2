active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the pros and cons of implementing Security Champion Networks versus relying solely on a central
    security team. Use examples from OWASP frameworks and real-world breaches like SolarWinds, where security culture failures
    amplified penetration testing vulnerabilities. Consider factors like scalability, engagement, and cost.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Champion is a full-time dedicated role'' vs. correct ''part-time additional duty''; ''Networks replace central security
    team'' vs. ''They support/augment it''; ''Champions must be security experts'' vs. ''Enthusiasts with training''). Ensure
    distractors are 80% realistic/common errors from research/breaches.'
