active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast OWASP WSTG and PTES frameworks for penetration testing benchmarks. Debate which
    is more suitable for social engineering retesting in remediation phases and why, considering real-world organizational
    constraints like budget, team expertise, and regulatory compliance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
