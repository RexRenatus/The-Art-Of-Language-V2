      only for GDPR'' vs. NIST); partial truths (e.g., low-risk trigger); opposites (e.g., ''after'' vs. ''before'' processing);
      unrelated frameworks.'
    count: 3-5 distractors per MCQ
    quality: Avoid obvious wrongs; derive from research (e.g., ICO triggers as NIST distractor)

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: [REFERENCE ACTIVITIES FOR SCENARIO CARDS]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [PASTE FULL LAYERS FROM ABOVE]

  - Research Context: PIAs/DPIAs identify/mitigate privacy risks in PII processing. Triggers: High-risk (NIST: pre-IT PII
  collection; ICO/GDPR Art 35: profiling/large-scale; OPC: new programs). Steps: Identify, Assess, Risk Map, Mitigate, Consult,
  Monitor. Sources: NIST SP 800-53 Rev5 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final); ICO DPIA (https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/accountability-and-governance/data-protection-impact-assessments-dpias/);

  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards following the exact schema: Array of JSON objects with ''front'', ''back'' (object with
  answer/explanation/bloom_level/layer/source), ''type''. Ensure even coverage of objectives/layers. Use distractor protocol
  for MCQs. Make questions active recall-focused (e.g., ''What are the 3 main triggers...''). Output ONLY the JSON array,
  no extra text.'
