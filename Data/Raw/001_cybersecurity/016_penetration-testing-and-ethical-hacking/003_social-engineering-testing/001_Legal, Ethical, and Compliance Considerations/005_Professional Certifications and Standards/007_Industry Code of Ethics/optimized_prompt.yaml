active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of social engineering testing, debate whether it is ethical to use real personal information
    (with permission) versus fabricated data in simulations. Reference specific tenets from EC-Council and (ISC)² codes to
    support your position. This encourages critical thinking on confidentiality and deception.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Partial truths: Include near-matches from other codes (e.g., EC-Council tenet as distractor for (ISC)²).'
