  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''CREST certification is superior to OSCP for social engineering
    testing due to its emphasis on ethical standards.'' Use a comparison table (columns: Certification, Rigor, Ethical Focus,
    Social Engineering Relevance, Cost) to support arguments and reference ISO 27001/GDPR alignments.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
