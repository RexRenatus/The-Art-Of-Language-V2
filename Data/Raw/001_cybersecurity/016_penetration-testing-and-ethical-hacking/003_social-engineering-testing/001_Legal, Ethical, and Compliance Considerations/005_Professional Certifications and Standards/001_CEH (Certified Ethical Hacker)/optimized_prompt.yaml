active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the role of CEH certification in preventing ethical lapses during social engineering tests. How
    do standards like GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA influence ethical decision-making? Provide real-world examples of compliance
    failures, such as phishing campaigns breaching patient data protections.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
