        "core_logic": "Facility access controls are crucial because they protect the physical environment where ePHI resides, preventing unauthorized physical entry that could lead to data compromise. This works by implementing measures like locks, guards, and visitor logs to secure buildings and sensitive areas.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Facility access controls are about physical security of locations, not remote system access, data encryption, or auditing electronic logs, though they are part of a layered security approach.",
        "analogy": "Facility access controls are like the locks on the doors and windows of a building; they prevent unauthorized people from physically entering and accessing sensitive areas or equipment."

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Workstation use policies are important because they define how employees should interact with systems containing ePHI, minimizing risks associated with user actions. This works by setting clear guidelines on permissible activities, such as preventing the installation of unauthorized software or accessing non-work-related sites.",
        "distractor_analysis": "These policies focus on the *use* of workstations (user actions and functions), not on mandating specific hardware, automatically encrypting data, or solely on physical security, although these can be related aspects.",
        "analogy": "Workstation use policies are like the rules for using a library computer; they specify what you can and cannot do, like not downloading large files or installing software, to keep the system secure and functional."
