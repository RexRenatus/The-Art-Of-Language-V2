active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent should penetration testers prioritize SOX compliance over comprehensive vulnerability
    discovery in financial systems? Use case studies like Enron or WorldCom to support your argument, and link to prior knowledge
    of ethical hacking rules of engagement.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse SOX with GDPR), 2)
    Partial truth (e.g., correct for another reg like PCI-DSS), 3) Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Pen testing always
    violates SOX''). Ensure distractors test nuance in SOX-IT-cyber intersection.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in SOX Compliance Testing.
  Use the provided topic hierarchy (adjusted for accuracy: Cybersecurity > Compliance and Auditing > Regulatory Compliance
  > SOX Compliance Testing), research context (SOX Act 2002, ICFR, ITGC, pen testing for financial controls; sources: ibm.com/topics/sox-compliance,
  auditboard.com/blog/sox-cybersecurity-compliance), and voter suggestions (complete frameworks, industry standards like NIST/PCI-DSS,
  ethical trade-offs).

  Ensure coverage: 1/3 basic recall (Layers 1-2), 1/3 application (Layer 3), 1/3 synthesis (Layer 4). Tag each with Bloom''s
  level and layer. Output as a numbered list in markdown, grouped by Bloom''s level. Make questions challenging yet scaffolded,
  with distractors per protocol. Promote active recall and spaced repetition best practices.'
