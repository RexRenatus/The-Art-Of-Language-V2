active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the limitations of ethical boundary testing in social engineering penetration testing: When does
    restricting tactics like pretexting or physical access hinder vulnerability detection (e.g., insider threats), and when
    should pentesters prioritize compliant alternatives like simulated phishing? Consider real-world cases like GDPR fines
    for non-consensual data handling.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
