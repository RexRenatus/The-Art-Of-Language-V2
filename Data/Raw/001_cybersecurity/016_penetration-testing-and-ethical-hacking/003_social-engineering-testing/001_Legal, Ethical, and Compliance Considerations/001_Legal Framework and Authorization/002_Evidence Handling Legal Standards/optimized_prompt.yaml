active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a penetration test involving social engineering (e.g., phishing), you capture sensitive data in RAM.
    The client later disputes the findings in court. How might a broken chain of custody affect admissibility, and what steps
    from RFC 3227 ensure compliance? Discuss misconceptions about digital vs. physical evidence.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (2) Misconceptions (digital evidence as non-volatile like physical), (3) Partial truths (e.g., NIST SP 800-86 only for
    IR, not pentest), (4) Irrelevant standards. Ensure 70% high-quality (plausible), 30% obvious. Balance across Bloom''s
    levels.'

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ''learning_objectives'']

  - Active Learning: Use discussion/peer/problem-solving to inspire flashcards with application prompts.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute content across 4 layers: [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING DESCRIPTION]. Builds on prior ''Legal Framework
  and Authorization''.

  - Full Research Context: Core Concepts (Security Incident-RFC2828, Digital Evidence, Chain of Custody, Order of Volatility).
  Frameworks: RFC 3227 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3227 – volatility order: registers > RAM > routing > ARP
  > processes > kernel > config > disk > logs > backups; procedures/checklists); NIST SP 800-86 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-86
  – forensics in IR); NISTIR 8387 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/NISTIRs/NIST.IR.8387.pdf – evidence in IR playbooks,
  archiving best practices). Big picture: Liability protection in pentest lifecycle.
