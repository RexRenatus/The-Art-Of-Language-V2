active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a penetration test involving social engineering for a financial institution, debate whether employee
    targeting (e.g., phishing simulations) should be included in the scope. Consider legal frameworks like PTES Pre-engagement
    guidelines and NIST SP 800-115, potential liabilities under regulations like GDPR, and ethical risks of scope creep. Argue
    for inclusion vs. exclusion, citing real-world examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    1. Semantic confusion (e.g., mix scope with RoE).

    2. Overgeneralization (e.g., assume all exclusions are technical, ignore legal).

    3. Edge-case reversal (e.g., treat limitation as expansion in scope creep).

    Ensure distractors are realistic from research context (e.g., PTES vs. NIST differences) and voter scenarios (social eng
    risks).'
