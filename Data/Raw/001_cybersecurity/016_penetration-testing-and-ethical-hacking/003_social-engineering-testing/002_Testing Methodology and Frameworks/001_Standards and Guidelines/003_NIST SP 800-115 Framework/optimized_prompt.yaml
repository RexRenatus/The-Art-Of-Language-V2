active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss how NIST SP 800-115's structured methodology (Planning, Discovery, Attack, Reporting) applies
    to social engineering testing. What are the ethical challenges in simulating phishing attacks, and how does the framework
    address them? Compare with OSSTMM or PTES frameworks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Full Research Context (Completed):** NIST SP 800-115 ''Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment''
  provides a structured methodology: Planning (scope/ROE), Discovery (Information Gathering: OSINT/recon on targets; Vulnerability
  Scanning: tools like Nessus/Nmap), Attack (Penetration: exploitation, incl. social eng like phishing), Reporting (Analysis:
  findings/risks; Recommendations). Best Practices: Ethical ROE mandatory; tools (Wireshark, Metasploit); social eng adaptations
  (consent, no real harm). Integrates with NIST 800-53/800-30. Comparisons: More gov-structured than OSSTMM (metrics), PTES
  (execution-heavy), OWASP (web-specific). Sources: NIST.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-115.pdf; csrc.nist.gov.


  **Incorporate These Elements:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste the 6 objectives above].

  - Active Learning: [Paste discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving].

  - Scaffolding: Generate cards distributed across 4 layers [Paste scaffolding key_content].

  - Topic Focus: Emphasize social engineering testing applications.


  **Generation Rules:**

  - Create 50 flashcards (12-15 per scaffolding layer; balance Bloom''s levels).

  - Use flashcard_schema: MCQ front/back, distractor protocol strictly.

  - Questions test recall, application, analysis (e.g., scenarios, comparisons).

  - Explanations: 100-200 words, reference phases, link to objectives/activities.

  - Vary Q types: Definitions (Layer1), Phase explanations (Layer2), Steps/examples (Layer3), Comparisons/critiques (Layer4).

  - Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}}, ...].

  Ensure completeness, accuracy, and engagement for university-level learners.'
