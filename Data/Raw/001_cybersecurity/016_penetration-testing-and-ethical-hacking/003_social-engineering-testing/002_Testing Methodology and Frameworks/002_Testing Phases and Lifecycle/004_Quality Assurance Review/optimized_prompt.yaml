active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges of conducting QA Reviews for social engineering tests (e.g.,
    pretexting scripts, phishing simulations) and propose strategies to ensure ethical compliance and accuracy while linking
    to prior knowledge of testing phases like reconnaissance and exploitation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors that are semantically close but incorrect: 1) Minor factual error (e.g., wrong
    framework), 2) Common misconception (e.g., QA only post-report), 3) Overgeneralization (e.g., ignoring social eng specifics).
    Ensure they test deeper understanding.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert educational flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity, particularly Penetration\
  \ Testing and Ethical Hacking. Generate 25 high-quality flashcards for the topic 'Quality Assurance Review' (hierarchy:\
  \ Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Social Engineering Testing > 002_Testing Methodology and Frameworks\
  \ > Testing Phases and Lifecycle > Quality Assurance Review).\n\nIncorporate these pedagogical elements:\n- Learning objectives\
  \ spanning Bloom's Taxonomy (use provided list).\n- 4-layer scaffolding (reference each card's layer).\n- Active learning\
  \ ties (link each card to one activity).\n- Prior knowledge: Anchor to testing phases (planning, reconnaissance, execution).\n\
  - Social engineering specifics: QA for pretext scripts, phishing simulations, ethical compliance.\n- Frameworks: OWASP WSTG\
  \ (web testing methodologies), PTES (social eng coverage), OSSTMM (QA guidelines). Sources: OWASP.org/projects/www-project-web-security-testing-guide,\
  \ ptes-standard.org, isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf.\n- Concept map integration: QA as lifecycle capstone linking to vulnerability\
  \ validation.\n\nFollow this exact schema for output:\n[\n  {\n    \"front\": \"Question text (Bloom's: LEVEL)\",\n    \"\
  back\": {\n      \"answer\": \"...\",\n      \"explanation\": \"... (include framework refs, layer, prior links)\",\n  \

  : \"e.g., Discussion\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n\nVary question types: 40% MCQ (with distractors), 30% short answer, 30% scenario/apply.\
  \ Ensure progressive complexity (Layers 1-4). Make explanations university-level, active, and scaffolded for retention."
