active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student teaches the PTES pre-engagement steps (e.g., client kickoff, scope negotiation) while
    the other takes notes and quizzes them on social engineering adaptations (e.g., defining phishing targets); switch roles.
  problem_solving: 'Draft a scope document for a bank''s social engineering test involving vishing and phishing simulations:
    identify in-scope assets (e.g., employee personas), out-of-scope elements, ROE, timelines, and regulatory considerations
    (PCI-DSS).'

    - Distractor 2: Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., include all regulations without context).

    - Distractor 3: Inverse/extreme (e.g., ''no boundaries needed for ethical hacking''). Base on real-world errors from CompTIA
    PenTest+, PTES, or social eng ethics.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and\

  \ Level 1: Cybersecurity > Level 2: Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Level 3: Social Engineering Testing > Level\
  \ 4: 002_Testing Methodology and Frameworks > Level 5: Testing Phases and Lifecycle > Level 6: Planning and Scoping Definition).\n\
  \nIncorporate:\n- **Learning Objectives** (span Bloom's): [insert the 6 objectives above].\n- **Scaffolding Layers**: Distribute\
  \ cards: 7-8 per layer [insert layer descriptions].\n- **Active Learning Hooks**: Reference in explanations (e.g., 'Practice\

  \ regulatory compliance (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR, SOX), PTES/CompTIA steps, ROE templates.\n- **Research Context**: PTES pre-engagement,\
  \ CompTIA PenTest+ Domain 1, ethical boundaries to prevent legal risks.\n\n**Output Format (JSON array of flashcards)**:\n\
