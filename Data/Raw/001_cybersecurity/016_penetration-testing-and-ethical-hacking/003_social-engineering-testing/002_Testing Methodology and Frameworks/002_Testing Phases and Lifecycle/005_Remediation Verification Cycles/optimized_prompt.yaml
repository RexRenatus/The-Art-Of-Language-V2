  Generate flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet: Spaced repetition friendly, active recall focus. Draw from completed research:
  NIST SP 800-115 (follow-up assessments), PTES (full 7 phases with re-testing in Reporting), OSSTMM (verification audits),
  social eng examples (phishing training verification via re-sims, vishing access controls). Include real-world example: Post-phishing
  test, verify training by re-testing 20% users, measure click rates drop from 30% to <5%, check regressions.
