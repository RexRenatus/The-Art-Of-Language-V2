        "core_logic": "IP/URL reputation and age checks are important because attackers frequently rotate their C2 servers, making newly registered or known malicious domains easier to block. This works by cross-referencing connection destinations against threat intelligence feeds.",

        "analogy": "It's like a bouncer checking IDs at a club, refusing entry to anyone known to cause trouble or who just showed up with a fake ID."
