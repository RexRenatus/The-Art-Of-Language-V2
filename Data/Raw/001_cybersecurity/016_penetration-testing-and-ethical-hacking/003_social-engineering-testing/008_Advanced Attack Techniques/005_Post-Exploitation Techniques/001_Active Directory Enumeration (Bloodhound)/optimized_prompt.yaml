active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical implications of using BloodHound in a penetration test versus
    a defensive security operations center (SOC). How does it empower both red and blue teams, and what are the risks of misinterpretation
    of attack paths?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    confuse SharpHound with BloodHound roles, mix up collection methods, misattribute MITRE techniques). Ensure distractors

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing. Generate\
  \ 50 high-quality flashcards (20 basic recall, 15 application/analysis MCQs, 10 evaluation/create open-ended, 5 integration)\
  \ on 'Active Directory Enumeration (BloodHound)' using university pedagogy: Bloom's Taxonomy objectives, active learning,\
  \ 4-layer scaffolding, and Anki/SuperMemo best practices (active recall, spaced repetition, imagery cues).\n\n**Corrected\
  \ Topic Hierarchy (addressing voter consensus on mismatch - not Social Engineering):** \n- Level 1: Cybersecurity\n- Level\
  \ 2: Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking\n- Level 3: Enumeration Techniques\n- Level 4: 008_Advanced Attack Techniques\n\
  - Level 5: Post-005_Exploitation Techniques\n- Level 6: Active Directory Enumeration (BloodHound)\n\n**Learning Objectives:**\
