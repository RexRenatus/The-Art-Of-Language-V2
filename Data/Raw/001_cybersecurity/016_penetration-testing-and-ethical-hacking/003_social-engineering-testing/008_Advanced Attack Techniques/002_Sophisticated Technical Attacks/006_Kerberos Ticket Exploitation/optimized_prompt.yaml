  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Kerberos ticket exploitation techniques like Golden and
    Silver Tickets are more dangerous than traditional password spraying because they enable stealthy persistence.'' Support
    your position with references to MITRE ATT&CK T1558 sub-techniques and real-world examples, considering detection trade-offs.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    tool or step); 4) Edge cases (e.g., Sapphire Ticket as distractor for Silver). Ensure plausibility for active recall testing.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and
  Ethical Hacking. Topic: ''Kerberos Ticket 005_Exploitation'' (Domain: Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking; Updated Subdomain:
  Kerberos Attacks / Credential Access Techniques [MITRE T1558]; Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing > Kerberos
  Attacks > Advanced Attack Techniques > Sophisticated Technical Attacks > Kerberos Ticket Exploitation).


  Generate 50 high-quality Anki-style flashcards covering all techniques: Golden Ticket, Silver Ticket (forged TGS, no KDC
  interaction), AS-REP Roasting (T1558.003), Kerberoasting (T1558.004), Sapphire/Diamond Tickets. Ensure coverage of prerequisites,
  flow, tools (Mimikatz, Rubeus), detection, mitigations, attack chains.


  Incorporate:

  - Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives: [insert learning_objectives array here]

  - Scaffolding: [insert scaffolding object here]

  - Active learning ties: Reference discussions/exercises in explanations.


  Use exact flashcard_schema: Output JSON array of objects with ''front'', ''back'' (answer, explanation, distractors), ''metadata''.
  Balance types: 20% cloze, 30% short answer, 50% MCQ. 10-15 cards per scaffolding layer; span Bloom''s levels evenly. Distractors
  per protocol. Explanations: 2-4 sentences, educational, with action verbs.


  Prioritize completeness/accuracy: Technical focus, no social engineering. Sources: MITRE ATT&CK T1558, Kerberos RFCs, tools
  docs.'
