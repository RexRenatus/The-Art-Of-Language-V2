  discussion_prompt: 'In a group debate, argue whether social media-to-phone transitions are more effective than direct phishing
    attacks and why, citing MITRE ATT&CK techniques like T1586.001 (Compromise Accounts: Social Media Accounts) and T1566
    (Phishing). Consider ethical implications and success metrics from industry reports.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
