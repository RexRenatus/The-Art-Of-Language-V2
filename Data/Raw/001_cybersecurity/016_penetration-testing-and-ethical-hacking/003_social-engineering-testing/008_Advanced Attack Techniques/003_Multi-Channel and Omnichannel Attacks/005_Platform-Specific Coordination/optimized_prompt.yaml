active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student teaches the partner a platform-specific social engineering technique and tool (e.g.,
    SMS spoofing with tools like SMS Spoofer for Android testing, or LinkedIn phishing setups using Social-Engineer Toolkit),
    followed by a quiz and role reversal.
  problem_solving: In small groups, design a multi-channel social engineering attack plan for a fictional company using three
    platforms (email for initial phishing, social media for reconnaissance/follow-up, phone for vishing). Include PTES phase
    mapping, risk mitigation, and a debrief presentation.

    rules:
    - '1. Partial truths: Correct concept but wrong platform/context (e.g., ''Email for vishing'' instead of phone).'
    - '2. Common misconceptions: Mix OS platforms with comms (e.g., ''Windows-specific'' for social eng).'
    - '3. Similar terms: Confuse PTES phases or MITRE tactics (e.g., Phishing vs. Smishing).'
    - '4. Outdated/irrelevant: Pre-2010 tactics or non-social eng (e.g., buffer overflow).'
    - '5. Reverse logic: Opposite of correct (e.g., ''Ignore platform differences'').'
    - Ensure distractors are realistic for ethical hackers to avoid/misapply.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and
  Ethical Hacking. Topic: **Platform-Specific Coordination** under hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical
  Hacking > Social Engineering Testing > 008_Advanced Attack Techniques > Multi-Channel and Omnichannel Attacks > Platform-Specific
  Coordination. Focus: Coordinating social engineering across communication platforms (email, SMS, social media, phone) with
  tailored lures/phishing/vishing, per voter-aligned accuracy (not OS/network focus).


  **Adjusted Research Context:** Platform-specific coordination = strategic adaptation of social eng tests to unique traits
  of comms platforms (e.g., SMS brevity for smishing, social media visuals for pretexting). Frameworks: PTES (7 phases adapted:
  Pre-engagement scopes channels; Intelligence via OSINT/platform APIs; Threat Modeling channel risks); MITRE ATT&CK (T1566
  Phishing, T1598 Phishing for Info); OSSTMM social eng; OWASP Testing Guide (social eng vectors); Sources: PTES.org, attack.mitre.org,
  osstmm.org, owasp.org.
