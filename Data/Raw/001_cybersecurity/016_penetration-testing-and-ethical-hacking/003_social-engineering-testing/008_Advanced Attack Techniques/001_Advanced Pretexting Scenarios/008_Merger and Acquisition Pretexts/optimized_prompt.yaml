  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the ethical boundaries of using M&A pretexts in authorized pentests versus real-world attacks:
    When does simulation cross into potential harm, and how can pentesters ensure proportionality while maximizing test efficacy?'

  distractor_protocol: 'Create plausible distractors based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., confusing pretexting with real
    M&A due diligence); 2) Similar terms (e.g., ''phishing'' vs ''vishing''); 3) Opposites (e.g., defensive vs offensive use);
    4) Partial truths (e.g., real M&A risk but not pretext-specific); 5) Voter-noted errors (e.g., defensive cyber diligence
    instead of offensive pretexting). Ensure distractors test nuance in advanced pretexting.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and
  Ethical Hacking. Topic: ''Merger and Acquisition Pretexts'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical
  Hacking > Social Engineering Testing > 008_Advanced Attack Techniques > Advanced Pretexting Scenarios > Merger and Acquisition
  Pretexts). Focus EXCLUSIVELY on OFFENSIVE social engineering pretexting techniques using fabricated M&A scenarios (e.g.,
  impersonating integration teams/lawyers/auditors to phish credentials during authorized pentests). Ignore defensive cyber
  due diligence; reframe research context (M&A risks, NIST CSF, pentesting) to pretext exploitation.
