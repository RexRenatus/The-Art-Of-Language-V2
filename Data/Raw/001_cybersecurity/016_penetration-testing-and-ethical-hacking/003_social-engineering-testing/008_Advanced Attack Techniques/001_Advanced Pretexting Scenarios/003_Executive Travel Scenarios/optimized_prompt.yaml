active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the most effective pretexting tactic for targeting executives during travel
    (e.g., USB baiting at airports vs. fake hotel WiFi support). Provide real-world examples from cybersecurity reports and
    evaluate ethical boundaries in penetration testing.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and\
  \ Ethical Hacking. Generate 20 high-quality flashcards (5 per scaffolding layer) on 'Executive Travel Scenarios' using the\
  \ exact topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity (Level 1) > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking (Level 2) > Social Engineering\
  \ Testing (Level 3) > 008_Advanced Attack Techniques (Level 4) > Advanced Pretexting Scenarios (Level 5) > Executive Travel\
  \ Scenarios (Level 6).\n\nIncorporate this completed research context: Executive travel risks include physical theft, digital\
  \ surveillance (IMSI catchers, WiFi sniffing), USB baiting (infected USBs left in airports/hotels), BadUSB, rogue WiFi,\
  \ hotel compromises. OpSec: preparation/vigilance/review. Sources: frameworks.securityalliance.org, cyber.gc.ca, vikingcloud.com,\
  \ dni.gov.\n\nUse these learning objectives: [insert full list from JSON].\n\nStructure via 4-layer scaffolding: [insert\
  \ full scaffolding from JSON].\n\nActive learning integration: Weave in prompts/activities into explanations (e.g., 'Discuss\
  \ in peer teaching...').\n\nText-based concept map: Central 'Executive Travel Pretexting' → Threats (Physical Theft, USB\
  \ Baiting, etc.) → OpSec Countermeasures → Pentest Steps → Integration with Social Engineering.\n\nOutput EXACTLY in this\
  \ flashcard schema for each: \n{\n  'layer': 'Layer 1 Foundation',\n  'bloom_level': 'REMEMBER',\n  'front': 'Question?\
