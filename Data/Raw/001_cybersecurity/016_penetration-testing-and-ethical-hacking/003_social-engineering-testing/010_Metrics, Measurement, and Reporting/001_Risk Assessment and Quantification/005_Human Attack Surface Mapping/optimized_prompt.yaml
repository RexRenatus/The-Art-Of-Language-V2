active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how human attack surface mapping should influence risk prioritization in
    penetration testing reports compared to technical vulnerabilities. Use examples from phishing simulations and insider
    threat metrics to support your arguments, building on foundational social engineering knowledge.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    vs. human risks; mix up MITRE IDs like T1588 vs. T1091; use real but irrelevant metrics). Ensure distractors are web-grounded
    (e.g., from social engineering stats) and teachable moments in explanations.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and

  Building on prior knowledge of basic social engineering (phishing, pretexting) and security awareness from earlier modules...


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Active learning: Weave in discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving hooks in explanations.

  - Scaffolding: 4 layers [insert full descriptions above]; flashcards must reference layer and progress from foundation to
  integration.

  - Big picture: Fits pen testing lifecycle (recon->assessment->reporting); quantifies human risks (susceptibility scores,
  phishing metrics, insider probabilities) for Risk Assessment subdomain.

  - Research: Human attack surface = human vulnerabilities (social eng, insiders); techniques (phishing, baiting, T1091);
  frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK).


  Generate flashcards per schema: [insert full schema above]. Ensure snake_case fields, 100% accuracy (e.g., T1091 not T1588),
  measurable outcomes with action verbs. Balance coverage: objectives, layers, voter priorities (metrics, hands-on templates).
  Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards.'
