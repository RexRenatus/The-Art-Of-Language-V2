active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How might overlooking role-specific vulnerabilities in a social engineering campaign lead to inaccurate
    campaign metrics and failed pen testing reports? Discuss with real-world examples from breaches (e.g., Twitter hack targeting
    executives) or NIST SP 800-53 guidelines, considering role differences in phishing susceptibility.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, use an organizational chart to explain RBAC principles and role-specific vulnerabilities to each
    other. Then, switch roles to teach how these apply to social engineering metrics (e.g., higher click rates for finance
    roles), incorporating feedback on clarity and examples.
  problem_solving: 'Given a company structure (e.g., CEO, IT admin, intern), map roles to access permissions, identify social
    engineering vulnerabilities (e.g., spear-phishing risks), compute campaign risk scores based on metrics like click/report
    rates, and propose prioritized remediations. Simulate with sample data: Executives (high access, 20% click rate), Staff
    (low access, 5% click rate).'

    role-specific). Ensure distractors are realistic from research context or voter-noted errors (e.g., ignoring SE metrics).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and
  Ethical Hacking. Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for the topic ''Role-Based Vulnerability Analysis'' in
  the hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Social Engineering Testing > 010_Metrics, Measurement,
  and Reporting > Campaign Analytics > Role-Based Vulnerability Analysis.


  Incorporate:

  - Research context: RBAC restricts access by role; Vulnerability Analysis prioritizes weaknesses; Pen Testing simulates
  attacks; Ethical Hacking improves security. Align to social engineering: Role-specific metrics (e.g., exec phishing susceptibility).
  ISO 27001 Annex A.9/A.14 for access control. Sources: securends.com, ibm.com, NIST SP 800-53.

  - Voter priorities: Strengthen SE ties (phishing by role), complete ISO desc, add examples/real breaches.
