active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one partner explains tracking pixel mechanics (including HTML embedding and server logging), while
    the other draws a diagram of the process (email client → pixel request → tracking server) and teaches it back. Switch
    roles and quiz each other.
  problem_solving: 'Design a simulated phishing email campaign using GoPhish: embed a tracking pixel, deploy to test recipients,
    analyze open rates/logs for recon data (e.g., OS, location), refine the campaign based on metrics, and report evasion
    techniques against image blockers.'

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQ cards: 1. Common misconception (e.g., ''Tracking pixels use
    JavaScript'' vs. images). 2. Related but wrong concept (e.g., ''SMTP logs opens'' vs. HTTP). 3. Edge case/error (e.g.,
    ''Always accurate despite blockers''). Ensure distractors teach by contrast in explanation. Balance card types: 40% basic,
    30% cloze, 30% MCQ.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and
  Ethical Hacking. Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for the topic ''Email Open Rate Tracking'' (Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Social Engineering Testing > 010_Metrics, Measurement, and Reporting
  > Campaign Analytics > Email Open Rate Tracking). Voter-approved focus: completeness (NIST CSF, MITRE T1566/T1598, OWASP),
  pedagogy (Bloom''s progression), active learning, 4-layer scaffolding, hands-on (GoPhish/Python), concept maps.

  - Active Learning: [PASTE THE FULL active_learning OBJECT HERE] – link 10% of cards.

  - Scaffolding Layers: [PASTE THE FULL scaffolding_layers OBJECT HERE] – tag cards accordingly.

  - Research: Tracking pixels (invisible 1x1 image → server log IP/UA/time/location; HubSpot); pentest recon (active emails,
  OS/geo); standards (NIST SP800-53 SC-8, OWASP Testing Guide).


  Follow EXACT flashcard_schema: Output ONLY a JSON array of 75 flashcards, each as {type, front, back: {answer, explanation,
  bloom_level, layer, tags, source}, metadata}. Ensure variety, no duplicates, progressive difficulty (L1 easy recall → L4
  synthesis). Use distractor_protocol for MCQs. Promote Bloom''s: mix levels evenly.'
