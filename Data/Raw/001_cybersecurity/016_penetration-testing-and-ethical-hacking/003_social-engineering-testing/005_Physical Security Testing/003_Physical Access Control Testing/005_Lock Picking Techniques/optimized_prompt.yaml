  discussion_prompt: 'In a penetration testing engagement with written authorization, debate the role of lock picking in the
    attack chain: When should it be prioritized over social engineering, and how does it contribute to red teaming objectives
    per NIST SP 800-115? Consider ethical boundaries and real-world examples like DEF CON Lockpicking Village.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per card:

    1. Common misconception (e.g., ''Tension wrench lifts pins'' instead of rotates cylinder).

    2. Confused similar concept (e.g., mix SPP with raking steps).

    3. Edge case/error (e.g., illegal/unethical application without authorization).

    Ensure distractors test nuance, avoid obvious wrongs. Base on research context, voter priorities (ethics, accuracy).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ethical penetration testing.
  Generate high-quality, pedagogical flashcards for ''Lock Picking Techniques'' under the CORRECTED topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Physical Security Testing > 006_004_Physical Security Testing > Physical Access
  Control Testing > Lock Picking Techniques. STRICTLY emphasize ethical use: ONLY with written authorization, per PTES and
  NIST SP 800-115; prevent misuse.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use for context/inspiration.

  - Scaffolding Layers: Generate 10-12 cards per layer, progressing foundation to integration. Tag each card with layer and
  Bloom''s level.


  Core Content: Pin tumbler locks (most common); tools (tension wrench applies torque, pick lifts pins to shear line); SPP
  (individual pins), Raking (rapid scrub); feedback (binding, false sets); big picture (physical access in attack chain, red
  teaming).


  Follow Flashcard Schema EXACTLY:

  - Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''options'': {''A'': ''...'', ''B'': ''...'', ''C'': ''...'', ''D'':
  ''...''}, ''answer'': ''e.g., **B** Explanation here...'', ''layer'': 1, ''blooms_level'': ''Remember'', ''hierarchy'':
  ''Full hierarchy string''}]

  - Distractors per protocol.

  - 40-50 total cards, balanced.


  Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, no illegal promotion.'
