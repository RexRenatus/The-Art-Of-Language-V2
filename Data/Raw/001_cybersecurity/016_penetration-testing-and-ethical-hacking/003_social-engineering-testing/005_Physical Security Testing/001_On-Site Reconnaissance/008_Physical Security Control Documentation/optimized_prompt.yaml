active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the role of NIST SP 800-53 PE controls documentation in a physical penetration test scenario.
    Debate whether comprehensive documentation prevents or hinders agile response to threats, using real-world examples like
    data center breaches (e.g., 2019 Capital One breach involving physical access elements).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: Always exactly 3 distractors. Make them plausible (e.g., similar NIST controls, common misconceptions).
    Each distractor must have 'text' (short phrase) and 'explanation' (1-2 sentences why wrong, citing source). Avoid repetition;
    vary difficulty.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on
  the exact topic: ''004_Physical Security Control Documentation''. Use this topic_hierarchy: {''Level 1'': ''Cybersecurity'',
  ''Level 2'': ''Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking'', ''Level 3'': ''Social Engineering Testing'', ''Level 4'': ''006_004_Physical

  Core content: Physical Penetration Testing simulates attacks on premises to find vulnerabilities. Physical Security protects
  assets. Documentation records controls for compliance/auditing. NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 PE family: PE-1 Policy, PE-2 Authorizations,
  PE-3 Access Control, PE-4 Records, PE-5 Output, PE-6 Monitoring, etc. U.S. Dept. of Education standard aligns with NIST
  PE. Sources: NIST SP 800-53 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf), ISACA (https://www.isaca.org).
