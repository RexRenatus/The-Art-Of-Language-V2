active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare the security risks of traditional REST APIs versus client-side Channel Messaging APIs (e.g.,
    postMessage, BroadcastChannel). Which is more vulnerable to origin spoofing attacks, and why? Provide examples from OWASP
    API Top 10 and debate mitigation strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
