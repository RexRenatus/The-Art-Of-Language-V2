active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI) in terms of impact on
    client-side versus server-side execution. How does client-side include manipulation (e.g., via reflected parameters in
    script src) lead to XSS? Debate the pros and cons of mitigation strategies like CSP headers versus client-side input sanitization,
    providing real-world examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., confuse client-side
    with server-side LFI execution), 2) Partial truths (e.g., valid server-side payload as distractor), 3) Related but incorrect
    concepts (e.g., SSRF instead of XSS). Ensure distractors are realistic from OWASP/research context.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing. Topic:
  ''Client-side Include Manipulation'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Web Application
  Penetration Testing > 013_Client-Side Testing > Client-side Resource Manipulation > Client-side Include Manipulation). Emphasize
  client-side focus (e.g., dynamic script/iframe src via user input leading to XSS), distinguishing from server-side LFI/RFI.
  Use voter consensus: pedagogy via Bloom''s progression, discussion/debate, problem-solving with Burp/dev tools, 4-layer
  scaffolding, OWASP WSTG, mitigations (CSP vs sanitization), prior knowledge (path traversal, input validation).


  Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE].

  Active Learning: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE] - Weave into explanations.

  Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL 4 LAYERS FROM ABOVE] - Distribute cards across layers.


  Generate exactly 25 flashcards following the exact schema: For each, output as JSON object with ''type'', ''front'', ''back'',
  ''bloom_level'', ''scaffolding_layer'', ''tags'' (3-5 relevant tags). Balance: 10 MCQ (with distractors per protocol), 10
  Q&A, 5 Cloze. Ensure high pedagogical value: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, misconception-busting. Base on research:
  OWASP WSTG client-side testing, examples like ''<script src="{{userInput}}.js"></script>''. Output ONLY a JSON array of
  25 card objects, no extra text.'
