active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the risks of third-party JavaScript libraries in real-world applications, using examples from
    recent breaches like the 2020 SolarWinds attack—how could script source manipulation have been detected earlier through
    client-side testing?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truths (e.g., CSP blocks all external scripts—false, configurable). 3) Confusions with related concepts (e.g.,
    mix with SQLi). Ensure plausible for intermediate learners; avoid obvious errors.'
