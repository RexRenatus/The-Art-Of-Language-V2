active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI) with Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Why does
    the Same-Origin Policy (SOP) exception for <script> tags create a vulnerability, and how does it balance security with
    functionality like third-party ads? Debate mitigation strategies such as JSONP with padding or CORS, considering trade-offs
    in usability and security.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Plausible misconceptions (e.g., confuse XSSI with XSS execution instead of inclusion)
    - Partial truths (e.g., SOP blocks all cross-origin, ignoring script exception)
    - Common errors (e.g., claim CSRF uses script tags for data exfil)
    - Opposites/reversals (e.g., SOP exception blocks scripts)
    - Irrelevant but similar terms (e.g., mix LFI server-side with client-side XSSI)
    - Ensure 3 distractors per MCQ, balanced difficulty
    coverage: Distribute across layers/objectives; 40% recall, 30% apply/analyze, 30% evaluate/create
system_prompt: 'You are an expert educational flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity topics, using university-level
  pedagogy (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for the topic
  ''Script Inclusion Authentication Bypass'' in the hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Web
  Application Penetration Testing > 013_Client-Side Testing > Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI) > Script Inclusion Authentication
  Bypass.


  Incorporate these exactly:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the array above]

  - Active Learning Components: [summarize discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving for context in explanations]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste the 4 layers above] – tag each card to one layer.

  - Prerequisites: SOP, XSS, CSRF (reference in foundational cards).

  - Research Context: XSSI leverages SOP script exception (RFC 6454) for auth bypass/data exfil via <script src>; differs
  from CSRF (actions) and LFI/RFI (server-side); mitigations CSP/CORS/JSONP padding; OWASP WSTG-CLNT-13 testing.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: [paste schema above]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 75 flashcards, each as {"type": "MCQ|Q&A|Cloze|Scenario",
  "front": "...", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "bloom_level": "REMEMBER", "layer": "Foundation", "related_activity":
  "Discussion Prompt|Peer Teaching|Problem-Solving|None"}}. Ensure even coverage of objectives/layers, precise distractors,
  engaging scenarios (e.g., Burp Suite PoC), and ethical hacking emphasis. No extra text.'
