  Research Context: Business Impact Translation connects pen test findings to business consequences (e.g., XSS/SQLi → revenue
  loss/fines). Key Concepts: BIA (extended for impacts), mission-essential functions, risk scenarios, asset categorization,
  impact values. NISTIR 8286D (full: NISTIR 8286 series on Cybersecurity-ERM Integration; 8286D: Threat Frameworks for Prioritized
  Risk Profiles, enabling translation to business continuity). Standards: NIST SP 800-30, OWASP. Sources: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8286.pdf,
  https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-30r1.pdf, OWASP.org.


  Incorporate: Learning Objectives [paste list above]; Active Learning [reference for inspiration]; Scaffolding Layers [paste
  summaries]; Prior Knowledge: Web vulns (XSS/SQLi).


  Big Picture: Concept Map - BIA → Functions → Assets → Findings → Scenarios → Impacts → ERM/Prioritization. Turns technical
  reports into executive tools.


  Generate 25 flashcards using the exact schema: Formats (Basic Q/A, MCQ, Cloze; ~8 each), distractor protocol strictly. Balance:
  Bloom''s levels, layers. Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''...'', ''front'':
  ''...'', ''back'': ''...''}]. Ensure university pedagogy: active, measurable, progressive. No duplicates; high-quality,
  exam-ready.'
