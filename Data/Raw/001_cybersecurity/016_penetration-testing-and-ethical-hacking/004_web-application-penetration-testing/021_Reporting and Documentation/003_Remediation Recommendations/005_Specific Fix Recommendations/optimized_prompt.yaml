active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of remediation strategies for SQL injection (e.g., input
    validation vs. prepared statements) in a high-traffic e-commerce web app. Reference OWASP WSTG and NIST SP 800-115 to
    support arguments on effectiveness, implementation cost, and long-term security benefits.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    1. Common misconception (e.g., ''Input sanitization alone fixes SQLi'' – partial, ignores prepared stmts).

    2. Partial truth/overkill (e.g., ''Use WAF only'' – doesn''t address root cause).

    3. Unrelated fix (e.g., ''Add HTTPS'' for XSS – confuses with another vuln). Ensure distractors test nuance from scaffolding
    layers.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing. Topic:
  ''Specific Fix Recommendations'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Web Application Penetration
  Testing > 021_Reporting and Documentation > Remediation Recommendations > Specific Fix Recommendations). Use the provided
  scaffolding content, learning objectives, and voter priorities (e.g., NIST SP 800-115 full details, OWASP Top 10 fixes with
  code ex: SQLi=prepared stmts, XSS=output encoding/CSP).


  Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom''s progression, active learning hooks. Generate 40-50 flashcards strictly following
  the FLASHCARD_SCHEMA (JSON array of objects). Cover objectives evenly, scaffold layers (Layer1:20%, Layer2:20%, Layer3:30%,
  Layer4:30%). Ensure completeness: NIST SP 800-115 (full: planning/discovery/attack/reporting w/remediation), OWASP WSTG
  SDLC, concrete fixes.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, e.g., [ {card1}, {card2}, ... ]. No extra text.'
