active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In groups, debate the strengths and limitations of CVSS v2 versus v3.x for web app pentest reporting.
    Consider accuracy in modern threats like cloud-native apps and how scores influence vulnerability prioritization—provide
    evidence from NVD examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Use these LEARNING OBJECTIVES (Bloom''s progression): [insert array above].


  Incorporate SCAFFOLDING LAYERS: [insert array above].


  Include ACTIVE LEARNING hooks in explanations (e.g., ''Discuss in peer teaching: ...'').


  Generate flashcards per FLASHCARD SCHEMA: Multiple-choice with 1 correct answer + 2-4 distractors (per protocol), full back-side
  explanation tying to objectives/layers/voter priorities (accuracy: Temporal not Threat; completeness: v2 metrics like Access
  Vector/Complexity; examples like SQLi/XSS; qualitative ratings). Output 30-40 cards in JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'',
  ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''...'', ''...''], ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'',
  ''scaffolding_layer'': 1-4, ''source'': ''FIRST.org/NVD''}}].


  Voter priorities: Focus v2/v3.x (no v4), full metric tables/examples, step-by-step calcs, vector strings, pentest integration.
  Research: FIRST.org standard, Base/Temporal/Environmental, score 0-10. Ensure pedagogical depth for university-level pentest
  training.'
