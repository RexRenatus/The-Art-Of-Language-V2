active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a real-world pentest, you discover a padding oracle in a bank's web app. Debate the ethical, legal,
    and practical steps you should take next, including disclosure vs. full exploitation for POC. Compare with other crypto
    vulns like Heartbleed.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ (4 options, 1 correct): Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions from
    research/voters: (1) Confuse PKCS#7 with other paddings (e.g., ''all zeros''), (2) Misstate CBC chaining (e.g., ''XOR
    with next block''), (3) Wrong attack steps (e.g., ''requires key knowledge''), (4) Invalid mitigations (e.g., ''longer
    keys suffice''). Ensure distractors are 70% plausible to challenge understanding.'

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the array above].

  - Active Learning: [summarize discussion/peer/problem-solving].

  - Scaffolding: Generate flashcards distributed across 4 layers [paste scaffolding details].

  - Prior Knowledge: CBC mode, XOR, PKCS#7 from basics.

  - Research: Padding oracle exploits CBC padding validation leaks (PKCS#7) for keyless decryption via oracle queries. Steps:
  Manipulate C_{i-1}, guess bytes for valid pad. Mitigations: AEAD, constant-time. Tools: PadBuster. Real-world: IIS vulns,
  OWASP/NIST.


  Generate flashcards per schema: [paste full schema]. Cover all Bloom''s levels proportionally (20% remember/understand,
  30% apply/analyze, 30% evaluate, 20% create). 40% Layer1-2 (foundational), 60% Layer3-4 (applied). Use active learning for
  scenario-based cards (e.g., ''In pentest bank app...''). Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition friendly,
  no hints on front. Output ONLY the JSON array of flashcards.'
