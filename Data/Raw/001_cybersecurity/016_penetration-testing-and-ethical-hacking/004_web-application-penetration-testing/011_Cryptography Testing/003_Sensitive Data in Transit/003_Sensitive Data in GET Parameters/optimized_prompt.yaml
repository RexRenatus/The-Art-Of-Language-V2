active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the misconception that 'HTTPS fully protects sensitive data in GET parameters.' Provide evidence
    from server logs, browser history, and referral headers. How does this fit into OWASP Top 10 risks like A05:2021 Security
    Misconfiguration or legacy A6 Sensitive Data Exposure?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  INTEGRATE:

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use for contextual questions (e.g., ''In a discussion on HTTPS myths...'').

  - Scaffolding: 4 Layers [PASTE FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE].

  - Prior Knowledge: Anchor to basic HTTP GET/POST.

  - Research: Risks (URL visibility, logs, history, referrers); Standards (OWASP Top 10 A05:2021/A6 legacy, NIST SP 800-52/63/95,
  CWE-200); Pen Testing (Burp/ZAP detection, mitigations: POST/HTTPS/HSTS/no-logging).

  - Examples: Bad (?user_email=john@example.com&token=abc123), Good (?sort=asc). Misconception: HTTPS fully protects GET.


  FOLLOW Flashcard Schema EXACTLY [PASTE FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Generate 25 flashcards in JSON array format: [{''front'':
  {...}, ''back'': {...}}, ...]. Ensure active recall, spaced repetition best practices: concise fronts, rich backs with explanations/references.
  Balance Bloom''s levels/layers. No adult/offensive content.'
