active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the ethical implications of reporting unencrypted sensitive data transmission in a penetration
    test versus exploiting it for educational purposes. Use real-world examples like the Equifax breach to support your arguments,
    considering legal standards such as PCI DSS and stakeholder impacts.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Plausible but incorrect: Based on common errors (e.g., confuse HTTP with HTTPS security, wrong tool purpose like ''Nmap''
      for enumeration vs. Wireshark for capture).'
    - 'Variety: One semi-correct (partial truth), one unrelated, one opposite.'
    - 'Avoid: Obvious wrongs or giveaways; ensure 60-70% learner error rate for challenge.'
    - 'Sources: Draw from research context misconceptions (e.g., assuming all web traffic is encrypted).'

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Active Learning: Use discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving to inspire higher-order Qs (e.g., ''Evaluate ethical reporting
  in a scenario'').

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers [insert full scaffolding above]; tag each with layer.

  - Prior Knowledge: Link to TCP/IP, HTTP/HTTPS basics, intro crypto.

  - Research Context: Sensitive data (PII/financial), risks (interception/MitM), tools (Wireshark/Burp), standards (PCI DSS
  encrypt cardholder data, OWASP WSTG-CRYP-03, NIST SP 800-52), examples (Equifax).


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards following this schema [insert full schema above]. Output as JSON array: [{''front'':
  ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'', ''opt3''], ''metadata'': {''blooms'':
  ''Apply'', ''layer'': ''3'', ''prereq'': ''Networking basics''}}]. Ensure active recall, spaced repetition friendly, university-level
  rigor. Vary formats, use voter-suggested tools/scenarios.'
