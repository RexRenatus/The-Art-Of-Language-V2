active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, Student A uses 'openssl s_client' to inspect a provided HTTPS site's certificate (e.g., from badssl.com)
    and explains Subject Alternative Names (SANs), Common Name (CN), and validation process to Student B. Student B quizzes
    A on key fields and switches roles to reinforce teaching.
  problem_solving: 'Provide students with a Wireshark capture or Burp Suite proxy log of a web session. Task: Identify any
    Certificate Name Mismatch, simulate MITM implications, and design a penetration test report section recommending fixes
    like proper SAN configuration, HSTS implementation, or certificate pinning. Emphasize reporting best practices.'

    - 'Plausible but incorrect: Based on common misconceptions (e.g., ''Expired certificate'' instead of ''Name mismatch'';
      IP access acceptability vs. public exposure).'
    - 'From research/voters: Use real tools/errors (e.g., distractor: ''sslyze --no-checks'' as wrong command).'
    - 'Variety: 1 superficial (typo/similar term), 1 conceptual (related vuln like weak cipher), 1 advanced (edge case like
      wildcard SAN).'
    - 'Avoid: Obvious wrongs; ensure 1 distractor is a frequent real-world confusion (e.g., ''CN only, ignore SANs'').'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing. Topic:
  ''Certificate Name Mismatch'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Web Application Penetration
  Testing > 011_001_Cryptography Testing > Certificate Validation > Certificate Name Mismatch). Consensus: 82.9% approval.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives (exact list provided): Cover all Bloom''s levels evenly.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute across 4 layers (descriptions provided).

  - Active learning: Weave in discussion/peer/problem-solving prompts as scenario-based cards (e.g., ''In a pen test debate,
  evaluate if IP-access mismatch is critical?'').

  - Research/voters: Definitions (name mismatch = hostname != CN/SAN, MITM indicator); Tools (openssl s_client -connect example.com:443
  -servername www.example.com, sslyze, testssl.sh, nmap --script ssl-cert); Best practices (detection/remediation: SAN config,
  HSTS, pinning; reporting); Prior knowledge (SSL/TLS basics); Big picture (MITM prevention in web pen testing).


  Generate 30-50 high-quality flashcards per EXACT schema provided (JSON array). Vary types: basic (definition recall), cloze
  (key terms), MCQ (analysis/eval with distractors). Each card advances pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition, misconceptions.
  Ensure university-level: precise, tool-focused, ethical hacking context. Balance: 5-10 per Bloom''s level, 7-12 per layer.
  Output ONLY the JSON array of flashcards.'
