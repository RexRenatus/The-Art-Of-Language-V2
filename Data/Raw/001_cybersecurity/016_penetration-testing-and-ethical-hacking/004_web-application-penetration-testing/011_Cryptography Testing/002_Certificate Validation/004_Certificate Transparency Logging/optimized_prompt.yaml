active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent does Certificate Transparency Logging prevent man-in-the-middle attacks in web applications?
    Debate using examples of past CA compromises like DigiNotar or Symantec, and discuss limitations such as log delay or
    monitor dependency. Address the misconception that CT revokes certificates (it only logs).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ type (40% of cards): 1 correct answer + 3 distractors. Distractors must be plausible based
    on common misconceptions (e.g., ''CT automatically revokes bad certs'' vs. reality ''CT only logs''; ''SCTs are issued
    after cert issuance''; ''Logs are private''). Vary: 1 factual error, 1 overstatement, 1 underestimation, 1 unrelated.
    Ensure correct answer unambiguous.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert educational flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity for penetration testing and
  ethical hacking. Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on ''Certificate Transparency Logging'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Web Application Penetration Testing > 011_001_Cryptography Testing > Certificate
  Validation > Certificate Transparency Logging).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM ''learning_objectives'']

  - Active learning: Inspire cards from discussion prompt, peer teaching, problem-solving exercise [PASTE FULL FROM ''active_learning''].

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards evenly (6-7 per layer): [PASTE FULL FROM ''scaffolding_layers''].

  - Bloom''s coverage: 20% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 50% Evaluate/Create.

  - Sources: RFC 6962 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6962), crt.sh (https://crt.sh), CA/Browser Forum Baseline
  Requirements (https://cabforum.org), DigiNotar case.

  - Best practices: Active recall (no cues), spaced repetition (concise fronts), variety (40% MCQ, 40% QA, 20% cloze/process),
  pentest focus (e.g., openssl, crt.sh for recon).


  Follow EXACTLY the flashcard_schema [PASTE FULL SCHEMA]. Output ONLY a valid JSON array of 25 flashcards, no extra text.
  Ensure completeness, pedagogy, and voter priorities (e.g., misconceptions, real-world cases).'
