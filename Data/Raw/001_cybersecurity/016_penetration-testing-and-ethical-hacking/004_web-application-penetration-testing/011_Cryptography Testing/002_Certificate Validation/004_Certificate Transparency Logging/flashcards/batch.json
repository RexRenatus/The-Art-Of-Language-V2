This process ensures that all publicly trusted certificates have undergone CT logging from an early stage.",

        "core_logic": "The append-only property is fundamental to CT logs because it guarantees that once a certificate is logged, it cannot be retroactively altered or removed. This immutability ensures that the log provides a reliable and trustworthy historical record, which is essential for detecting misissued certificates, since any tampering would be evident.",

        "core_logic": "If a CA fails to log its issued certificates in CT logs, those certificates will likely not meet browser requirements for trust.
