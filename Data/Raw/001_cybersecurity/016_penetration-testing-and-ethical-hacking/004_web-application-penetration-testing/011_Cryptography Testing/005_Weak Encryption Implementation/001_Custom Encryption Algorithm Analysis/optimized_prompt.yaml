active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the validity of Kerckhoffs' principle ('security should rely on the key,
    not the algorithm's secrecy') when applied to custom encryption in modern web apps. Provide real-world examples from IoT
    firmware or mobile apps where custom crypto failed, and propose alternatives using libraries like OpenSSL.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Mixing with standards (e.g., AES weaknesses attributed to custom), 3) Partial truths (e.g., ''Frequency analysis only
    works on classical ciphers''), 4) Real-world pitfalls (e.g., outdated NIST refs). Ensure 70% pedagogical value.'

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the full list from ''learning_objectives'']

  - Active Learning: Use concepts from discussions, peer teaching, and problem-solving for scenario cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4. Prerequisites: Basic encryption
  standards (AES/RSA).

  - Research Context: Core concepts (encryption, custom algos, cryptanalysis); Risks (poor key mgmt, weak PRNG); Standards
  (NIST SP 800-57 Key Management, OWASP Crypto Cheat Sheet, Cryptographic Storage Cheat Sheet); Best practices (avoid custom
  crypto, use OpenSSL); Techniques (frequency/differential analysis, side-channels); Sources: OWASP.org, NIST.gov/SP800-57,
  Kerckhoffs'' principle.

  - Big Picture: Emphasizes Kerckhoffs''; real-world: IoT/mobile pen testing.
