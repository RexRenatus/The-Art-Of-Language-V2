active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate why developers might hardcode encryption keys (e.g., convenience, deadlines)
    despite the risks, and propose three alternative secure practices with pros/cons. Reference real-world breaches like those
    exposed in public GitHub repos.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Hardcoding improves performance''),
    2) Partial truth (e.g., ''Safe if code is obfuscated''), 3) Unrelated flaw (e.g., ''Equivalent to weak IVs''). Ensure
    distractors are realistic based on voter suggestions/common errors in crypto testing.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing. Generate
  25 high-quality flashcards on ''Hardcoded Encryption Keys'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical
  Hacking > Web Application Penetration Testing > 011_001_Cryptography Testing > Weak Encryption Implementation > Hardcoded
  Encryption Keys).


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste the full learning_objectives array here].

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to activities like code analysis exercises.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute across 4 layers – [Paste full scaffolding here]. Ensure coverage: Foundation (defs), Components
  (risks), Implementation (tools/code), Integration (standards/sources).

  - Research Context: Hardcoded keys embed crypto keys in code/binaries, enabling easy extraction (e.g., grep/strings). Risks:
  Breaches, unauthorized access. Standards: NIST SP 800-57 (key mgmt), OWASP ASVS V14.


  Use this Flashcard Schema: [Paste full flashcard_schema here]. Output ONLY in JSON: {''flashcards'': [{''id'':1, ''type'':''Cloze'',
  ''front'':''...'', ''back'':''...''}, ...]}. Ensure pedagogical depth: Bloom''s progression, active recall, spaced repetition
  friendly. Use real code snippets (Python/Java). Distractors realistic. Explanations comprehensive but concise.'
