active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains the CBC mode IV predictability exploited by BEAST to their partner using hand-drawn
    diagrams; the partner then teaches back the full attack steps, including byte-by-byte deduction.
  problem_solving: Given Wireshark packet captures from a vulnerable TLS 1.0 CBC session, students identify BEAST-exploitable
    patterns (e.g., predictable IVs, block boundaries) and propose mitigations such as enabling TLS 1.1 IV randomization or
    RC4 cipher fallback.

    ''What enables BEAST?'': A) Random IVs in TLS 1.1 [wrong version], B) ECB mode predictability [wrong cipher], C) Padding
    oracle flaws [POODLE mix-up], D) Predictable IVs in TLS 1.0 CBC [correct]). Ensure distractors are 70% semantically similar
    but factually incorrect, drawn from research context or similar attacks.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and
  Ethical Hacking. Topic: BEAST Attack Vulnerability (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking >
  Web Application Penetration Testing > 011_001_Cryptography Testing > Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL) > BEAST Attack Vulnerability).
  Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE], active learning activities
  [INSERT active_learning OBJECT HERE], 4-layer scaffolding [INSERT scaffolding ARRAY HERE]. Incorporate research: BEAST is
  MITM exploiting TLS 1.0 CBC IV predictability (IV=prev ciphertext block), enabling JS chosen-plaintext byte-by-byte secret
  deduction (e.g., cookies) via block boundary manipulation.


  Generate flashcards per schema [INSERT flashcard_schema HERE]. Ensure coverage: balanced across levels/layers, active recall
  focus, no hints on fronts. Voter consensus: 87.1% approval emphasizes detailed attack steps, mitigations, pedagogy. Prior
  knowledge: CBC, TLS handshake, MITM. Output ONLY a JSON array of 25-35 flashcards, no extra text.'
