active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student demonstrates scanning a target (e.g., using nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 example.com
    or testssl.sh example.com) to identify weak ciphers; the partner explains the findings, vulnerabilities (e.g., RC4 stream
    cipher biases), and mitigations. Switch roles and discuss results as a group.
  problem_solving: 'Using a vulnerable web server setup (e.g., Docker container with outdated TLS config supporting RC4/3DES),
    students: 1) Scan for weak ciphers with multiple tools; 2) Classify findings (weak vs. strong); 3) Recommend mitigations
    (e.g., update to TLS 1.3 with AES-GCM); 4) Role-play presenting a pen test report to ''stakeholders''.'
