    rules:
    - Plausible based on partial truths (e.g., 'SHA-1 is slower than MD5' – true but irrelevant for collisions)
    - Common misconceptions (e.g., 'Hashing is reversible with enough compute' vs. preimage resistance)
    - Edge cases/outdated info (e.g., 'MD5 is fine for non-password data')
    - Similar concepts (e.g., confuse salt with pepper, or bcrypt params)
    - Avoid obvious wrongs; ensure 60-70% trickiness for intermediate learners

  Incorporate this research context: Hashing is one-way for passwords/integrity (sources: icertglobal.com, ccslearningacademy.com).
  MD5 (collision-vulnerable, e.g., SHAttered), SHA-1 (NIST-deprecated 2011/2020 for signatures, unsafe unsalted). Risks: rainbow
  tables, GPU cracking (Hashcat/John). Standards: OWASP Cheat Sheet (bcrypt/Argon2/PBKDF2 + salt + iterations). Pentest: SQLMap
  dumps, pattern ID (32/40 hex chars), cracking demos. Vs. encryption (reversible). Breaches: LinkedIn, Yahoo.
