active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between computational efficiency and security in password
    hashing algorithms (e.g., fast SHA-256 vs. slow Argon2id). How do these impact web app performance during high-traffic
    logins, and what mitigations would you recommend for penetration testers advising developers?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs based on common misconceptions: 1) Confuse similar algorithms
    (e.g., SHA-256 as ''secure'' vs. unsalted weak); 2) Mix properties (e.g., ''reversible'' for hashing); 3) Pentest pitfalls
    (e.g., ''bcrypt vulnerable to rainbow tables''). Ensure distractors teach via elimination.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and
  Ethical Hacking (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Web Application Penetration
  Testing > 011_001_Cryptography Testing > Password Storage > Password Hashing Algorithm Analysis). Generate 50 high-quality
  flashcards using the exact schema: Front (question), Back (answer, explanation, bloom_level, references, scaffold_layer).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the 6 objectives above].

  - Scaffolding: Progress from Layer 1 (foundation) to Layer 4 (integration), building on prerequisites like basic hash functions
  and web auth.

  - Active Learning: Weave in discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving elements (e.g., ''Debate: Why is MD5 unsalted crackable?'').

  - Key Content: Weak algos (MD5/SHA-1/unsalted SHA-256: rainbow/collision vulns); Strong (Argon2id/bcrypt/PBKDF2/scrypt:
  salt/iterations/memory-hard); Pentest findings/exploits (DB dumps, Hashcat); Sources: NIST SP 800-63B, OWASP Cheat Sheet/Top
  10 A02:2021.

  - Flashcard Schema: [paste full schema above]. Use distractor protocol strictly.


  Prioritize active recall, Bloom''s progression, university pedagogy. Output as numbered JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'',
  ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''references'': [...], ''scaffold_layer'':
  ''Layer X''}}]. Ensure completeness, no truncation, voter-approved specifics (e.g., Argon2id top choice).'
