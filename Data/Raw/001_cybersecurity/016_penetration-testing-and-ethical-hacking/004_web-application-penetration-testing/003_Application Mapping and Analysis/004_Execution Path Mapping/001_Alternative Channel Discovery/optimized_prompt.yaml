  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Standard execution path mapping (e.g., directory enumeration)
    is sufficient for 90% of web app pen tests.'' Use examples of alternative channels like DNS rebinding or timing attacks
    to support or refute, and link to OWASP Testing Guide reconnaissance phase.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing. Generate\
  \ 50 high-quality flashcards on 'Alternative Channel Discovery' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And\
  \ Ethical Hacking > Web Application Penetration Testing > 003_Application Mapping and Analysis > Execution Path Mapping\
  \ > Alternative Channel Discovery). Builds on prior: Standard execution paths (directory enumeration, endpoint discovery).\n\
  \n**Completed Research Context:** Alternative channels: Unconventional paths like covert (data hiding in HTTP headers/images),\
  \ side-channels (timing, cache via Spectre-like in web), DNS rebinding, hidden WebSockets/SSE/Service Workers, client-side\
  \ APIs. OWASP Testing Guide v4: WSTG-INFO-01/05/09 (Fingerprint Web Server, Enumerate Infrastructure, Test File Extensions),\
  \ WSTG-CLNT-*: Client-side testing for hidden channels. NIST CSF: Identify function (Asset/Threat mapping via alt channels);\
  \ SP 800-115: Technical pen test recon. Examples: Timing attacks (padding oracles), fuzzing hidden paths. Sources: OWASP.org/testing-guide,\
  \ NIST.gov/cyberframework, PortSwigger.net/web-security, PayloadsAllTheThings GitHub.\n\n**Incorporate:**\n- Learning Objectives:\
  \ [Paste the 6 objectives above].\n- Scaffolding: 4 layers [Paste scaffolding details]. Balance 10 cards per layer.\n- Active\
  \ Learning: Tie explanations to activities.\n- Concept Map: Reference in cards (e.g., 'Links to OWASP Recon').\n\n**Output\
  \ Format (JSON Array):** Each card as object per schema:\n{\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"front\": \"Question? A) Opt1 B) Opt2 C) Opt3\
