active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the ethical implications of discovering and reporting exposed configuration
    files during a pentest. Consider real-world cases like the Twitter 2022 leak: What risks do organizations face if pentesters
    withhold findings? How does this align with frameworks like NIST CSF ''Identify'' function?'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Prior Knowledge: Basics of web app structure, HTTP requests, directory brute-forcing.


  Incorporate these exactly:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: [paste active_learning here]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste scaffolding here]


  Content Details:

  - Common files: web.config, .env, php.ini, app.config, database.yml; backups (.bak, ~).

  - Techniques: Manual (/config/, /admin/), fuzzing (Gobuster: ''gobuster dir -u http://target -w config-wordlist.txt -x php,conf,json'';
  FFUF, Burp Intruder), wordlists (dirbuster/config).

  - Risks: Credential leaks, API keys; e.g., Twitter 2022 config leak led to auth bypass.

  - Defenses: .gitignore secrets, file permissions, WAF, no backups in webroot.

  - Standards: NIST CSF 2.0 (Identify: asset mgmt), ISO/IEC 27001 (A.9.4 Info access, A.12.6 Tech vuln mgmt).

  - Sources: OWASP Testing Guide v4 (https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/), NIST SP 800-53 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/fpd),
  PortSwigger Burp Docs.


  Use Bloom''s Taxonomy: Balance 40% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate/Create. Scaffold across 4 layers.
  Embed active learning hooks.


  Output Format (JSON array of 30 flashcards):

  [{ "front": "Question", "back": { "answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "distractors": ["opt1", "opt2", "opt3"] }, "bloom_level":
  "Apply", "layer": 3, "tags": ["Tool:FFUF", "Risk:Leak"] }, ...]


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: Varied Q types, plausible distractors, rich explanations. Ensure university pedagogy: measurable,
  active, scaffolded.'
