active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical and practical balance between thorough directory brute-forcing
    (e.g., large wordlists) and stealth (e.g., rate limiting, proxies) during a penetration test. How does this align with
    NIST SP 800-115 guidelines and real-world bug bounty programs? Support with examples from OWASP Juice Shop labs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet:

  - Cover all Bloom''s levels proportionally.

  - Follow exact schema: Each card as JSON object {front: str, type: str, back: {answer: str, explanation: str (200-400 words,
  pedagogical, with examples), bloom_level: str, scaffolding_layer: int, active_learning_link: str (optional)}}.

  - For MCQs: Front includes 4 options (A/B/C/D, randomize correct); distractors per protocol: plausible, misconception-based.

  - Varied types: 12 MCQ, 9 Q/A, 6 command/process, 3 create/eval scenarios.

  - Ensure ethical: Emphasize legal pen testing, no real attacks.

  - Output: JSON array of 30 cards. No additional text.'
