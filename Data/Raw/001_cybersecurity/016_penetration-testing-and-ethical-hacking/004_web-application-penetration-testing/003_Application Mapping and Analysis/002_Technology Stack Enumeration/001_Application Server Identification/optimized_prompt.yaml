  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives** (use exactly as provided): [INSERT learning_objectives JSON array here]

  - **Active Learning** (inspire questions from): [INSERT active_learning_components JSON array here]

  - **Scaffolding Layers** (distribute coverage): [INSERT scaffolding_layers JSON array here]

  - **Research Context**: Application servers (e.g., Tomcat, JBoss, WebLogic) host business logic; ID via HTTP headers (Server,
  X-Powered-By), error pages, banners, tools (WhatWeb, Wappalyzer, Nmap NSE), per OWASP Testing Guide v4 (WSTG-INPV-05). Standards:
  CREST pentest guidelines. Prerequisites: HTTP, Nmap recon.

  - **Sources**: OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/); WhatWeb GitHub
  (https://github.com/urbanadventurer/WhatWeb); CREST Guide (https://www.crest-approved.org/penetration-testing/).


  Follow **Flashcard Schema** exactly [INSERT flashcard_generation_schema JSON here]. Output as JSON array of objects, one
  per flashcard. Ensure variety, pedagogical depth, no repetition, and distractors that reinforce learning. Prioritize practical
  pentesting scenarios.'
