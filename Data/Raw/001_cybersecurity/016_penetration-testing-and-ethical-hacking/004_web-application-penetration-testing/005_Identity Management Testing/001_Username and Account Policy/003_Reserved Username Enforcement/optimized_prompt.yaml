active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the effectiveness of reserved username enforcement in preventing account takeovers compared
    to other identity controls like CAPTCHA or email verification. What are the trade-offs in terms of usability, security,
    and implementation cost? Use real-world examples from platforms like Twitter/X.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Research Context**: Reserved usernames (e.g., ''admin'', ''root'') prevent exploitation in web apps. Embedded in OWASP
  Testing Guide v4 (WSTG-SESS-07), NIST SP 800-63B (auth guidelines), CREST OSCP standards. Risks: Account takeover (MITRE
  T1110). CISA: Alerts on identity misconfigs (e.g., KCVD-2023-1234). Sources: OWASP.org, NIST.gov/sp800-63, MITRE.org/attack.
