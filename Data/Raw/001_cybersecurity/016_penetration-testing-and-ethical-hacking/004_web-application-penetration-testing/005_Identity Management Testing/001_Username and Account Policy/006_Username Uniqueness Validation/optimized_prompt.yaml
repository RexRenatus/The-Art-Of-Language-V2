  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use concepts from discussion, peer teaching, and problem-solving to inspire scenario-based cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers: [INSERT FULL LAYERS FROM ABOVE].

  - Prior Knowledge: Authentication, DB constraints, input validation.

  - Research: Account enumeration via differential responses, race conditions, tools (Burp Suite, curl, DVWA), OWASP A07:2021,
  Testing Guide v4.


  Generate flashcards using this EXACT schema: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards,
  e.g., [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}}]. Ensure high-quality: precise, educational, with explanations tying to objectives/layers.
  Cover completeness (vulnerable/secure code, mitigations) and pedagogy (progressive Bloom''s). No extra text.'
