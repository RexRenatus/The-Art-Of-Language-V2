active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In small groups, debate the ethical implications of sequential account name testing without explicit
    authorization (e.g., risk of false positives vs. real-world discovery). Propose 3 safeguards and relate to OWASP ethical
    guidelines. Share one key takeaway with the class.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing. Topic:\
  \ Sequential Account Name Testing (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Web Application\
  \ Penetration Testing > 001_005_Identity Management Testing > Username and Account Policy > Sequential Account Name Testing).\n\
  \nIncorporate this research context: Sequential testing systematically tries predictable usernames (e.g., admin1, user001)\
  \ to enumerate valid accounts via response differences, revealing weak policies. Key: Ethical, authorized only. Tools: Burp\
  \ Intruder, wfuzz. Mitigations: Rate limiting, uniform errors. NIST SP 800-63B: Strong authenticators. OWASP Testing Guide.\
  \ Sources: OWASP.org, NIST.gov, Burp Suite docs.\n\nUse these pedagogical elements:\n- Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL\
  \ LIST FROM ABOVE]\n- Active Learning: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE]\n- Scaffolding: 4 Layers [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM\
  \ ABOVE]\n\nGenerate exactly 25 flashcards following this EXACT schema:\n{\n  \"flashcard_id\": 1,\n  \"type\": \"MCQ|Cloze|Short\
