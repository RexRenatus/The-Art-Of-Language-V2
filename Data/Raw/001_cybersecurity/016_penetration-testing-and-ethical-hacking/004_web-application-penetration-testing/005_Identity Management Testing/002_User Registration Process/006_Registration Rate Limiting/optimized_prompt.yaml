active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of IP-based versus email-based rate limiting for user registration.
    Consider scenarios like VPN users or shared email services—how would you balance security and user experience? Provide
    evidence from OWASP guidelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    DoS''), 1 edge case reversal (e.g., swap IP/email), 1 overly simplistic/general term (e.g., ''Firewall rule'' instead
    of ''Token bucket''). Ensure distractors are realistic based on research context.'

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Weave in prompts from [discussion_prompt, peer_teaching_activity, problem_solving_exercise] as hints
  or follow-ups.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute questions across 4 layers (10-15 per layer): Layer 1 Foundation [FULL DESCRIPTION], Layer 2 Components
  [FULL], Layer 3 Implementation [FULL], Layer 4 Integration [FULL]. Tag each card with layer.

  - Prior Knowledge: Assume basics in web auth and API rate limiting.

  - Sources: OWASP Web Security Testing Guide v4 (https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/), OWASP ASVS v4.0.3

  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly [INSERT FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Output as JSON array: [{''id'':1, ''layer'':''1'', ''bloom_level'':''REMEMBER'',
  ''front'':''...'', ''back'':{''answer'':''...'', ''explanation'':''...'', ''active_recall_hint'':''...'', ''source'':''...''}},
  ...]. Ensure variety, active recall, no duplicates, pen testing focus (e.g., Burp, proxies). Prioritize voter consensus:
  pedagogy (Bloom''s progression, testing techniques), completeness (OWASP details).'
