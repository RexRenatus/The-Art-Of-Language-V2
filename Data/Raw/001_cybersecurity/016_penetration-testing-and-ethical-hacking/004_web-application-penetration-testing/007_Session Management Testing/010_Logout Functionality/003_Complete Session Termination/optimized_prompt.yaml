active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Analyze the Twitter 2009 breach where poor session termination enabled session hijacking. Debate whether
    client-side cookie cleanup alone suffices or if server-side invalidation is mandatory, referencing OWASP Session Management
    Cheat Sheet and NIST SP 800-53. Consider real-world implications for multi-device logouts.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Client-side deletion
    is sufficient' vs. correct 'Requires server-side invalidation'); use partial truths from research (e.g., OWASP vulns),
    voter priorities (session fixation), or scaffolding layers. Ensure 1 correct, distractors 25-33% accurate to test analysis.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing. Topic:
  Complete Session Termination (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Web Application Penetration
  Testing > 007_005_Session Management Testing > Logout Functionality > Complete Session Termination). Use provided learning
  objectives, active learning activities, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema to create optimized Anki-compatible flashcards.


  Incorporate:

  - Research: OWASP Top 10 A05:2021, NIST SP 800-53 SI-10, session invalidation, tools (Burp Suite, Postman), vulns (hijacking,
  fixation).

  - Voter priorities: Complete best practices (testing steps, multi-device, replay), pedagogy (Bloom''s, active learning).

  - Pedagogy: Bloom''s progression, active elements (e.g., reference Juice Shop exercises), scaffolding as content source.


  Generate 40 flashcards in JSON array: [{''type'': ''mcq|qa|cloze'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''REMEMBER|...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''1|...'', ''tags'': [''OWASP'', ''Burp'']}, ...]. Follow
  schema exactly: MCQs have 4 options (A-D, 1 correct), distractors plausible; explanations detailed with sources/tie-ins.
  Cover all objectives/layers evenly. Ensure measurable, active recall.'
