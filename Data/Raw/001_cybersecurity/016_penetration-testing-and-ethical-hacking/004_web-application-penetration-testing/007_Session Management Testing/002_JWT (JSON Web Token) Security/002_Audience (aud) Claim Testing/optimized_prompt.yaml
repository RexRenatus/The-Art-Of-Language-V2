active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a multi-tenant SaaS application using JWT, how might failing to validate the 'aud' claim enable unauthorized
    data access across tenants? Debate detection methods (e.g., Burp Suite replay attacks) and mitigation strategies (e.g.,
    strict 'aud' enforcement vs. flexible routing), considering trade-offs in scalability and security.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives [insert learning_objectives array here], active learning [discussion_prompt,
  peer_teaching_activity, problem_solving_exercise], 4-layer scaffolding [layer1_foundation to layer4_integration].


  Use research context: ''aud'' claim tests server enforcement of intended recipients (e.g., tenant IDs) to prevent cross-audience
  access; tools: Burp, jwt.io; risks: Broken Access Control (OWASP A01); sources: OWASP JWT Cheat Sheet, PortSwigger Labs,
  NIST SP 800-53, RFC 7519.


  Output EXACTLY as JSON array of objects matching this schema [insert flashcard_schema.structure here]. Strictly follow distractor
  protocol. Ensure cards scaffold from Layer 1 (foundation) to 4 (integration), span all Bloom''s levels, promote active recall/spaced
  repetition. Questions testable, answers factual/precise. No chit-chat.'
