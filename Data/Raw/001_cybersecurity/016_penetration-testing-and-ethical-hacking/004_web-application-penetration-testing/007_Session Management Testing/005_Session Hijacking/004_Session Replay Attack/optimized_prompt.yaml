learning_objectives:
  remember:
  - objective: Define session replay attack, session ID, session hijacking, Man-in-the-Middle (MitM), and Cross-Site Scripting
      (XSS).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  evaluate:
  - objective: Critique the effectiveness of common session management practices (e.g., HttpOnly/Secure flags, TLS) against
      session replay attacks.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  create:
  - objective: Design a comprehensive mitigation strategy for session replay attacks in a web application scenario, including
      policy recommendations and OWASP-compliant best practices.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  understand:
  - objective: Explain the mechanism of a session replay attack, including how session IDs are intercepted and replayed to
      impersonate users.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Demonstrate a session replay attack using tools like Burp Suite or Wireshark in a controlled lab environment.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  analyze:
  - objective: Compare session replay attacks with other session hijacking methods (e.g., session fixation or prediction).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and
  Ethical Hacking. Topic: Session Replay Attack (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Web
  Application Penetration Testing > 007_005_Session Management Testing > Session Hijacking > Session Replay Attack).


  Prior Knowledge: HTTP basics, cookies (RFC 6265), session management.


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full learning_objectives JSON here]

  - Active Learning: Use scenarios from [Insert active_learning_components JSON here] for applied cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across [Insert scaffolding_layers JSON here] (tag each card with layer).

  - Research Context: Session replay = hijacking via replaying intercepted session ID (MitM/XSS vectors). Mitigations: HTTPS/TLS,
  HttpOnly/Secure cookies, short timeouts, ID regeneration. Tools: Burp Suite, Wireshark. Standards: OWASP Top 10 (Broken
  Auth, XSS), RFC 6265. Examples: Post-Heartbleed exploits.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following this schema exactly [Insert flashcard_generation_schema JSON here]. Output
  as JSON array of objects: [{''type'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'':
  ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''tags'': [''mitigation'', ''tool'']}, ...]. Ensure active recall, no hints in fronts,
  distractors challenge misconceptions. Balance: 30% remember/understand, 40% apply/analyze, 30% evaluate/create.'
