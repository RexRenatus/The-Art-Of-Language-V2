active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between usability (e.g., seamless single sign-on across
    subdomains) and security (e.g., strict subdomain isolation). Provide real-world examples from OWASP Top 10 breaches and
    propose a balanced policy.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
