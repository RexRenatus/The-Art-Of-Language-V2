active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In a group of 3-4, debate: ''Does automated workflow security testing reduce the need for manual pentesting,
    or does it complement it? Use OWASP WSTG examples to support your position.'' (15 mins, critical thinking on trade-offs).'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    'CI/CD only for deployment'). 3. Confusions with priors (e.g., Selenium vs manual browser). 4. Edge cases (e.g., ignore
    shift-left). Ensure 70% misconception-based.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing. Generate
  25 high-quality flashcards for ''Automated Workflow Security Testing'' using the provided JSON elements (learning_objectives,
  prior_knowledge, active_learning, scaffolding, concept_map, research_context, topic_hierarchy, flashcard_schema).


  Context: Topic in Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing > Web App Pentesting > Automated/Dynamic Testing > Browser Automation
  > Automated Workflow Security Testing. Voter consensus: 82.9% approval. Voter priorities: Bloom''s progression, scaffolding,
  tools (ZAP, Selenium, GitHub Actions), OWASP WSTG completion.


  Instructions:

  1. Cover all Bloom levels proportionally (per schema).

  2. Distribute across 4 scaffolding layers.

  3. Incorporate prior_knowledge checks in 20% cards.

  4. Tie 10% cards to active_learning (e.g., ''Discussion: Why automate?'').

  5. Use concept_map for relational cards (e.g., ''What branches from central node?'').

  6. Ground in research_context/sources; cite inline.

  7. Follow flashcard_schema exactly: JSON array of objects.

  8. Distractors: Strictly per protocol (plausible, misconception-based).

  9. Explanations: 2-4 sentences, reference objectives/layers/tools.

  10. Optimize for Anki/Quizlet: Clear, concise, active recall.


  Output ONLY a JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''type'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [...], ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': 1}, ...]

  No extra text.'
