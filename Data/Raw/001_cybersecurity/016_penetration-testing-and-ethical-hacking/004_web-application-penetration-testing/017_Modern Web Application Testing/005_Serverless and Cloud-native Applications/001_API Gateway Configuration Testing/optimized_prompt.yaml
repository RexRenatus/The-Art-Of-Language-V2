active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a serverless application, debate the most critical API Gateway misconfiguration (e.g., missing rate
    limiting vs. broken authentication) and its impact on scalable architectures. Use OWASP API Top 10 and the Capital One
    breach as evidence to argue for prioritization in penetration testing.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., ''routing'' vs. ''forwarding''), 2) related but incorrect vulnerability (e.g., ''SQL Injection'' instead of ''API
    Injection''), 3) outdated/best-practice reversal (e.g., ''disable rate limiting for performance''). Ensure distractors
    teach by contrast.'

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list from ''learning_objectives'' above].

  - Active Learning: Embed mini-prompts from [discussion_prompt, peer_teaching_activity, problem_solving_exercise].

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers – 25% Layer 1 (Foundation), 25% Layer 2 (Components), 25% Layer 3 (Implementation),
  25% Layer 4 (Integration). Use details from [scaffolding] sections.

  - Research Context: API Gateways as entry points handling routing/auth/rate limiting; vulnerabilities (broken auth/JWT issues,
  injection, rate limit bypass, CORS misconfigs, exposed endpoints); tools (Burp Suite, Postman, OWASP ZAP); cases (Capital
  One); best practices (OWASP API Testing Guide); big picture (secure serverless orchestration).


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly:
