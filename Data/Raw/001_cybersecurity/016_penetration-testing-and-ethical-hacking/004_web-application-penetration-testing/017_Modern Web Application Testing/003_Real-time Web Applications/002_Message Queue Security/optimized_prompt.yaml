active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate whether performance or security should take priority when configuring message queues for real-time
    web applications like live chat systems. Use RabbitMQ (feature-rich but heavier) versus ZeroMQ (lightweight but less secure
    by default) as examples, citing specific vulnerabilities and mitigations.
  peer_teaching: 'In pairs, explain the roles of producers, consumers, and brokers using hand-drawn diagrams. Then, perform
    a teach-back: One partner describes a vulnerability like unauthorized access, and the other quizzes them on detection
    and prevention methods.'
  problem_solving: 'Using a Docker-based lab with a vulnerable RabbitMQ instance, simulate penetration testing: Perform reconnaissance
    (e.g., nmap for port 5672), exploit DoS or tampering (e.g., via Metasploit or rabbitmqctl), then secure it by implementing
    TLS, ACLs, and user authentication. Debrief on lessons learned.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and
  Ethical Hacking. Topic: ''Message Queue Security'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking >
  Web Application Penetration Testing > 017_Modern Web Application Testing > Real-time Web Applications > Message Queue Security).


  **Context (Completed Research Summary):** Message queues enable asynchronous communication in distributed systems (producers
  send to brokers/queues, consumers receive). Key tech: RabbitMQ (AMQP/STOMP/MQTT, ACLs/TLS), ZeroMQ (lightweight TCP, no
  broker), Apache Qpid (AMQP). Security challenges: Unauthorized access (default creds), DoS (queue flooding), tampering (unencrypted
  messages), endpoint compromise (hacked producers/consumers inject malware), exposed brokers (ports 5672/15672). Pentesting:
  Recon (nmap), exploits (Metasploit RabbitMQ modules, rabbitmqctl), fuzzing, Burp interception. Mitigations: TLS/SSL, user
  auth/ACLs, encryption at rest/transit, monitoring (e.g., Prometheus), least privilege. Real-world: Misconfigs in breaches
  like Capital One (metadata via queues). Best practices: Disable guest user, enforce TLS, virtual hosts isolation. Link to
  real-time web: Queues backend WebSockets/SSE.


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the full ''learning_objectives'' array from above].

  - Active Learning: Incorporate prompts/activities into explanations (e.g., ''Simulate in Docker lab'').

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers [Insert full ''scaffolding_layers'' array].


  **Generation Rules:**

  - Use schema [Insert full ''flashcard_schema''].

  - Ensure active recall: Questions test misconceptions (e.g., ''Are queues secure by default?'').

  - Balance: 40% basic/cloze (recall/understand), 30% MCQ (apply/analyze), 30% scenario-based (evaluate/create).

  - University-style: Scaffold from simple recall to complex application; atomic facts for spaced repetition.

  - Prerequisites: Assume basics of web pentesting/WebSockets.
