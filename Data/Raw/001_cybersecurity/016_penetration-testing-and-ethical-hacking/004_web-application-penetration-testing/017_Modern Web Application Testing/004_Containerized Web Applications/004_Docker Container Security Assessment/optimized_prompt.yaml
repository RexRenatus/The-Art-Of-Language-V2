active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, Student A teaches CIS Docker Benchmark sections 1-5 (host configuration and access control) with
    examples, while Student B takes notes and teaches back sections 6-10 (Docker daemon config, image creation, and runtime).
    Switch roles and quiz each other on interconnections between host and runtime security.
  problem_solving: Given a vulnerable Dockerfile for a web app (e.g., using outdated Ubuntu base, root user, hardcoded secrets),
    teams identify issues using Trivy output, rewrite it securely (non-root, Alpine, multi-stage build), deploy it, scan with
    Docker Bench, and document a pentest report with risk ratings.

    not host''); (2) Plausible confusion (e.g., mix Trivy with Clair functions); (3) Extreme/overstated option (e.g., ''100%
    vulnerability-free images impossible''). Base on voter-noted gaps (e.g., open-source vs. commercial) and research (e.g.,
    Alpine vs. Ubuntu CVEs). Ensure 25% REMEMBER, 25% UNDERSTAND/APPLY, 25% ANALYZE/EVALUATE, 25% CREATE.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university pedagogy (Bloom's\
  \ Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized flashcards for 'Docker Container\
  \ Security Assessment' (Category: Cybersecurity; Domain: Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking; Subdomain: Web Application\
  \ Penetration Testing; Entry: 017_Modern Web Application Testing > Containerized Web Applications).\n\n**Full Topic Content\
  \ (Synthesized Research Context):**\nDocker container security assessment identifies/mitigates vulnerabilities in containerized\
  \ web apps. 90%+ companies use containers (sysdig.com). Key terms: Container Security (safeguard isolation; sentinelone.com);\
  \ Image (executable package, scan for vulns; docker.com); Provenance (track origin); Runtime (e.g., Docker Engine; sysdig.com);\
  \ CNAPP (integrated protection).\nCIS Docker Benchmarks (cisecurity.org): 50+ checks (host config, daemon TLS, non-root,\
  \ resource limits).\nBest Practices: Minimal bases (Alpine Linux), non-root users, no secrets in images (use vaults), network\
  \ policies, multi-stage builds, sign images (cosign), seccomp/AppArmor.\nTools: Docker Bench (github.com/docker/docker-bench-security;\
  \ CIS audit script); Trivy (aquasecurity.github.io/trivy; fast vuln scanner); Clair (quay.github.io/clair; static analysis);\
  \ Falco (falco.org; runtime behavioral monitoring).\nSources: sysdig.com/learn-cloud-native/docker-security-best-practices/;\
  \ sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/cloud-security/container-security/; docs.docker.com/engine/security/; www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/docker;\
  \ github.com/docker/docker-bench-security; aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/.\nPrior Knowledge: Docker basics (container vs\
  \ VM), web pentest scanning.\n\n**Learning Objectives:** [Insert array from above].\n**Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert scaffolding\
  \ object from above].\n**Active Learning:** [Insert active_learning object from above; weave into explanations].\n\n**Task:**\
  \ Generate 75 flashcards per the schema below, covering all Bloom's levels/objectives (balanced), scaffolding layers, and\
  \ active learning tie-ins. Ensure web-grounded accuracy, completeness (e.g., full best practices/tools). Vary formats: 60%\
  \ MCQ, 20% cloze, 10% short answer, 10% scenario.\n\n**Output Format:** JSON array of objects matching flashcard_schema.structure.\
  \ Example:\n[\n  {\n    \"front\": \"What does CIS Benchmark 4.1 recommend for Docker daemon? A) TLS B) Root user C) ...\"\
  ,\n    \"back\": {\n      \"correct_answer\": \"A) TLS...\",\n      \"distractors\": [\"B) Root...\", \"C)\", \"D)\"], \
  \ \n      \"explanation\": \"Enables encrypted comms (Layer 2, UNDERSTAND, CIS.org). Misconception: Open daemon safe locally.\
  \ Ties to peer teaching.\",\n      \"bloom_level\": \"UNDERSTAND\",\n      \"scaffolding_layer\": \"2\",\n      \"hints\"\
  : [\"Daemon security section\"]\n    }\n  }\n]\n\nPrioritize voter consensus: completeness, pedagogy progression, active\
  \ elements. No generic cards; all specific to pentesting containerized web apps."
