learning_objectives:
  remember:
  - objective: Define the .well-known directory and its purpose according to RFC 5785.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  evaluate:
  - objective: Assess the security risks of common .well-known files (e.g., security.txt, change-password) and debate the
      balance between thorough reconnaissance and ethical boundaries.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  create:
  - objective: Design a custom wordlist and enumeration script for .well-known files, including mitigation strategies for
      findings in a pentest report.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  understand:
  - objective: Explain the role of .well-known directory enumeration in the information gathering phase of penetration testing,
      including its relation to OWASP WSTG-INFO-04.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Use tools like gobuster or feroxbuster to enumerate files in the .well-known directory on a target web server.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  analyze:
  - objective: Interpret HTTP response codes (e.g., 200, 403, 404) from .well-known enumeration scans to identify exposed
      files and potential misconfigurations.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the balance between thorough reconnaissance (including .well-known enumeration) and avoiding unauthorized
    access. Provide examples from RFC 5785 and OWASP WSTG, considering ethical hacking scenarios where exposed files like
    security.txt could reveal attack surfaces.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: Generate exactly 3 distractors per flashcard. Each must be plausible (e.g., based on common errors
    like confusing RFCs, misinterpreting HTTP codes, or wrong tool flags). Provide 'text' (short, MCQ-style) and 'explanation'
    (1-2 sentences on why wrong, referencing correct concept). Ensure distractors test nuance without being obvious.
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing. Generate\
  \ 20 high-quality flashcards on '.well-known Directory Enumeration' (Topic Hierarchy: {level_1: 'Cybersecurity', level_2:\
  \ 'Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking', level_3: 'Web Application Penetration Testing', level_4: '002_Information Gathering\
  \ and Reconnaissance', level_5: 'Webserver Metafile Review', level_6: '.well-known Directory Enumeration'}). \n\nIncorporate\
  \ university pedagogy: Cover learning objectives across Bloom's Taxonomy (remember: define RFC 5785; understand: role in\
  \ recon/OWASP WSTG-INFO-04; apply: tool commands; analyze: HTTP responses; evaluate: risks/ethics; create: scripts/mitigations).\
  \ Distribute evenly (3-4 per level). Use 4-layer scaffolding (Prior Knowledge: web recon/HTTP codes; Layer 1: Foundation\
  \ - definitions/RFC/concept map; Layer 2: Components - files like security.txt/change-password; Layer 3: Implementation\
  \ - gobuster/feroxbuster/ffuf commands/wordlists; Layer 4: Integration - chaining/reporting). Tie to active learning (e.g.,\
  \ lab exercises, debates).\n\nOutput exactly 20 JSON objects in an array, each strictly following this schema: {question:\
  \ '...', answer: '...', distractors: [{text: '...', explanation: '...'}, {text: '...', explanation: '...'}, {text: '...',\
  \ explanation: '...'}], explanation: '...', bloom_level: '...', scaffolding_layer: '...', topic_hierarchy: {full hierarchy\
  \ verbatim}}. \n\nEnsure questions are active (e.g., 'What command...', 'Analyze this response...'). Distractors: exactly\
  \ 3 plausible ones with explanations. Explanations: comprehensive, 2-4 sentences, cite sources (RFC 5785, OWASP). Vary formats\
  \ (MCQ, true/false with twist, cloze). Promote retention via spaced repetition best practices."
