active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the real-world implications of internal IP leakage from a leaked corporate
    PDF (e.g., how it enables lateral movement in a penetration test). Cite examples from breaches like those referenced in
    OWASP or SANS resources and propose countermeasures.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Similar but incorrect tool/output (e.g., pdfid instead of ExifTool), 3) Partial truth (e.g., username leak instead
    of IP risk). Ensure distractors promote analysis by being realistic based on voter tools (ExifTool, strings) and research
    (IP ranges).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and
  Ethical Hacking. Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (20 Basic Q&A, 20 MCQ, 10 Application Scenarios) on ''Internal IP Address
  Leakage in Documents'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Web Application Penetration
  Testing > 002_Information Gathering and Reconnaissance > Metadata and Document Analysis > Internal IP Address Leakage in
  Documents).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full array from above]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert full scaffolding from above]

  - Active Learning: Reference activities in explanations.

  - Tools: ExifTool, pdfid, strings, Metagoofil, MAT2.

  - Research: Private IPs (10.0.0.0/8 etc.), risks (network mapping), prevention (metadata stripping), sources (OWASP, SANS).

  - Voter Consensus: Completeness on detection/prevention, pedagogy via Bloom''s/scaffolding.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: Use specified structure, distractor protocol, explanations. Ensure progression: 30% Layer
  1-2 (remember/understand), 40% Layer 3 (apply/analyze), 30% Layer 4 (evaluate/create). Balance Bloom''s levels.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 50 flashcards, each as: {''front'': str, ''back'': str, ''type'': str (Basic Q&A|MCQ|Application
  Scenario), ''bloom_level'': str (REMEMBER|etc.), ''explanation'': str, ''distractors'': array (empty if not MCQ)}.
