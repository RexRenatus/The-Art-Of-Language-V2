learning_objectives:
  remember:
  - objective: Define the WHOIS protocol and list its key components, including port number and basic query/response structure
      (RFC 3912).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  evaluate:
  - objective: Critique the limitations of WHOIS data post-GDPR (e.g., redacted personal info) and compare it to RDAP (RFC
      9082) for accuracy and utility in ethical hacking.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  create:
  - objective: Design a reconnaissance checklist that incorporates WHOIS analysis alongside other OSINT tools like DNS enumeration,
      including steps for ethical data handling.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  understand:
  - objective: Explain the role of WHOIS records in penetration testing reconnaissance, including how they reveal domain ownership,
      contacts, and technical details.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Query WHOIS data for a sample domain (e.g., example.com) using command-line tools like 'whois domain.com' or
      online services like whois.icann.org.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  analyze:
  - objective: Analyze a provided WHOIS record to identify potential attack vectors, such as outdated registration dates for
      domain takeover risks or registrant emails for phishing reconnaissance.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the ethical boundaries of WHOIS reconnaissance: When does gathering public domain data cross
    into unethical territory? Compare WHOIS with other OSINT tools like DNS enumeration, using real-world examples such as
    reconnaissance in the DNC hack or high-profile breaches. Consider post-GDPR privacy redactions and legal implications.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''WHOIS uses UDP port 53'' mixing with DNS),
      2) Partial truth (e.g., ''Port 80 for HTTP queries''), 3) Irrelevant but related (e.g., ''Port 25 for SMTP'').'
    - Ensure distractors are 70-80% similar to correct answer in phrasing/structure to challenge understanding.
    - Avoid 'all/none of the above'; make them realistic errors from ethical hacking contexts (e.g., post-GDPR confusions).

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full learning_objectives JSON here]

  - Active Learning: Use concepts from discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving to inspire analytical cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers - explicitly tag with layer (e.g., ''Layer 1: Foundation''). Content details:
  [Insert full scaffolding JSON here]. Include tools (whois CLI, whois.icann.org, theHarvester, recon-ng), RFCs (3912 for
  WHOIS, 9082 for RDAP), ethics (public data, GDPR limits), sample WHOIS for example.com.

  - Research Context: WHOIS (TCP/43, RFC 3912), records (registrant, dates, NS), registries/RIRs, RDAP replacement, IP/AS.
  Sources: RFC 3912, RFC 9082, ICANN.org, ARIN.net.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: [Insert full flashcard_schema JSON here]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 75 flashcards, each
  as an object with required fields. Ensure high-quality, spaced repetition-friendly (active recall, no hints in questions),
  university-level pedagogy.'
