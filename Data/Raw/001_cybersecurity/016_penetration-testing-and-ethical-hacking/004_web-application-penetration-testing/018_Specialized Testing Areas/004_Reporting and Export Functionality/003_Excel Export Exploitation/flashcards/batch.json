The <code>.xlsx</code> format, introduced with Excel 2007, is XML-based (OOXML), which is more standardized, easier to parse securely, and while it can still contain macros (in <code>.xlsm</code> files), the underlying structure is generally considered more robust against certain types of parsing exploits.",
