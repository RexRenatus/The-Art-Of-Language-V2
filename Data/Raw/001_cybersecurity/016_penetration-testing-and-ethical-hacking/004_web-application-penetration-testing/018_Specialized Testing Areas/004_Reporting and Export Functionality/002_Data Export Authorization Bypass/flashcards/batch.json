      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Understanding the difference is key because horizontal privilege escalation directly relates to data export bypass (accessing another user's data), whereas vertical escalation involves gaining broader system control, since they represent distinct ways unauthorized access can occur.",

        "analogy": "Vertical escalation is like a regular employee getting a manager's keycard to access restricted offices. Horizontal escalation is like one employee using their own keycard to access another employee's locked desk drawer."
