active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how Report Parameter Injection in reporting/export functionality could
    lead to broader supply chain attacks (e.g., via manipulated exported data). Reference OWASP Top 10 A03 and provide real-world
    examples from breaches. What prior knowledge of basic injection flaws (SQLi, Command Injection) is essential here?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding: [PASTE FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM ABOVE] – Distribute cards across layers.

  - Active Learning: Inspire cards that prep for discussions/exercises (e.g., scenario-based Qs).

  - Prior Knowledge: Assume basics like SQLi; link as needed.

  - Sources: OWASP Top 10 A03:2021 Injection (https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/), OWASP Injection Prevention Cheat
  Sheet (https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html), CAPEC-137 Parameter Injection,
  WSTG Testing Guide.

  - Examples: SQL payload in categoryId='' OR 1=1--, LDAP in user filters, impacts like unauthorized report exports.
