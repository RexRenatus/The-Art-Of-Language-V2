  discussion_prompt: 'Debate: In penetration testing, should testers actively manipulate transaction amounts to prove vulnerability,
    or only simulate? Consider ethical, legal, and OWASP guidelines (e.g., WSTG-BUSL-10).'
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains the step-by-step WSTG-BUSL-10 process for testing transaction authorization;
    the partner quizzes them on prevention techniques for amount tampering, then switch roles.
  problem_solving: Using a provided vulnerable web app (e.g., via OWASP Juice Shop or DVWA), students intercept payment requests
    with Burp Suite/ZAP, manipulate amount parameters (price, quantity, total), bypass checks, document outcomes, and design
    mitigations.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing. Topic:
  Transaction Amount Manipulation (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Web Application Penetration
  Testing > 018_Specialized Testing Areas > Payment Processing Security > Transaction Amount Manipulation). Use the provided
  research context: Transaction amount manipulation alters monetary values exploiting business logic flaws (e.g., weak validation
  in payment flows). Key: OWASP WSTG-BUSL-10 (test transaction authorization by tampering amounts post-calculation; complete
  cheat sheet: Identify flow, intercept requests, alter price/quantity/total, check server re-validation, ensure 2FA for high-value
  txns). Sources: OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG-BUSL-10), OWASP Testing Guide v4.2, PortSwigger Burp Suite Docs on
  Business Logic Flaws, real-world examples from HackerOne reports.


  Incorporate pedagogy: Learning objectives [insert list above]; Active learning [insert summaries]; Scaffolding layers [insert
  details]. Generate 50 high-quality flashcards per schema: MCQ with 1 correct + 3 distractors, full back-side details. Distribute:
  ~8-9 per Bloom''s level, across layers. Promote active learning (e.g., scenario-based Qs for APPLY). Output as JSON array:
