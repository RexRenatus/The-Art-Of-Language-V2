  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether PCI DSS v4.0 adequately addresses business logic flaws in recurring
    payments, using real-world breaches like the 2023 Stripe incident as examples. Counterarguments should highlight tokenization
    gaps and propose enhancements.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains P2PE vs. tokenization, including benefits and limitations; the partner then
    teaches back on PCI DSS prohibitions for SAD storage. Switch roles and provide feedback on accuracy.
  problem_solving: Given a vulnerable web app scenario (e.g., modifiable subscription amounts via parameter tampering in a
    URL like /subscribe?amount=10&token=abc123), students identify the business logic flaw, exploit it using tools like Burp
    Suite, and propose mitigations such as server-side validation and rate limiting.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions: 1) Semantic traps (e.g., confuse
    CHD with SAD), 2) Partial truths (e.g., ''PCI allows SAD if encrypted'' – false), 3) Real-world edge cases (e.g., ''Tokenization
    eliminates all business logic risks'' – no). Ensure distractors are web-grounded from PCI DSS/OWASP.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and
  Ethical Hacking. Topic: Recurring Payment Security (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking >
  Web Application Penetration Testing > 018_Specialized Testing Areas > Payment Processing Security > Recurring Payment Security).
  Use this research summary: Recurring Payments (automated subscriptions); CHD (PAN etc.); SAD (CVV/PIN, no storage); P2PE
  (end-to-end encryption); Business Logic flaws; PCI DSS (prohibits SAD, v4.0 updates: MFA, risk analysis). Sources: PCI SSC
  (pcisecuritystandards.org), OWASP Testing Guide v4, Stripe Security Docs (stripe.com/docs/security).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]. Cover all Bloom''s levels across flashcards.

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to activities (e.g., ''Use for peer teaching on P2PE'').

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards: 25% Layer 1 (Foundation + Concept Map), 25% Layer 2 (Components), 25% Layer 3 (Implementation),
  25% Layer 4 (Integration + Prior Knowledge/Big Picture).

  - Prior Knowledge: Reference OWASP Top 10, basic PCI.

  - Big Picture: Cards on real-world impact (e.g., subscription fraud breaches).

  3 distractors (plausible misconceptions), full explanations (why correct/wrong, citations), tags. Ensure university pedagogy:
  active recall, spaced repetition, no hints on front. Vary types: definitions (20%), scenarios (30%), diagrams (10%), pentest
  steps (20%), evaluations (20%).'
