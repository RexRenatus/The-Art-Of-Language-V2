active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical implications of email spoofing via injection in penetration
    testing versus real-world phishing campaigns. How does understanding this vulnerability aid in defending against Business
    Email Compromise (BEC)? Provide examples from the pentesting workflow (Input Validation → Mail Injection → Spoofing →
    Exploitation).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  25 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Email Spoofing via Injection'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing
  And Ethical Hacking > Web Application Penetration Testing > 009_Input Validation Testing > Mail Injection > Email Spoofing
  via Injection). Consensus: 87.1% approval from 7 voters.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: Use for contextual hints in explanations.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards: 6 Layer 1, 6 Layer 2, 7 Layer 3, 6 Layer 4.

  - Research Context: Focus on CRLF injection via vulnerable web forms (e.g., contact forms), SMTP headers, tools (Swaks,
  Burp, Telnet), risks (phishing, BEC, credential theft), mitigations (SPF/DKIM/DMARC). Sources: OWASP Testing Guide (https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/),
  PortSwigger Academy (https://portswigger.net/web-security/email-header-injection), Swaks docs (https://www.jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/).

  - Big Picture: Pentesting workflow role; Prior Knowledge: SMTP, SQLi/XSS.

  - Concept Map: Central: Email Spoofing; Branches: Injection Methods, SMTP Weaknesses, Risks, Mitigations.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: Mix basic (8), cloze (8), multiple-choice (9). Ensure active recall, no hints on front.
  Explanations: 2-4 sentences, tie to Bloom''s/objectives/layers, include practical example/payload. Distractors per protocol.


  Output ONLY as JSON array of flashcards: [{''type'': ''basic|cloze|mc'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''layer'':
