active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between strict Host header validation (e.g., allowlisting
    domains) and usability in multi-tenant web applications. How does this vulnerability connect to broader threats like Business
    Email Compromise (BEC)? Reference real-world CVEs or OWASP reports to support your arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    common misconceptions (e.g., confuse with SSRF instead of email injection; mix up RFC 5322 with RFC 2616; suggest invalid
    mitigations like ''URL encode Host'' which fails CRLF). Ensure distractors teach by correction in explanation.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing. Generate
  a set of 25 high-quality flashcards on ''Email Header Injection via Host'' (Category: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing
  And Ethical Hacking > Web Application Penetration Testing > 009_Input Validation Testing > Host Header Injection > Email
  Header Injection via Host).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full array from learning_objectives]

  - Active Learning: [summarize components, e.g., use discussion/peer/problems in explanations]

  - Scaffolding: Structure cards across layers (tag each: #Layer1, etc.): [paste full scaffolding]

  - Topic Context: Email Header Injection via Host exploits unvalidated HTTP Host headers (RFC 7230) in web apps to inject
  CRLF (%0D%0A) into email headers (RFC 5322), e.g., contact forms adding malicious CC/From. Mitigations: OWASP validation,
  SMTP libs. Sources: OWASP Testing Guide v4, PortSwigger Academy, NIST SP 800-53, RFC 5322/7230.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: [paste full flashcard_schema].

  Output ONLY valid JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''tags'': [''#tag1'',
  ''#tag2'']}, ...]. Ensure Bloom''s progression, voter priorities (pedagogy, completeness), no criminal assistance.'
