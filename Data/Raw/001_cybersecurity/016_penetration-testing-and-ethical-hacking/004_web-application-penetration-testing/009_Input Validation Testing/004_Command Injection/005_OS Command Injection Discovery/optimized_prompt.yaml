active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss how OS Command Injection contributes to remote code execution (RCE) risks within the OWASP Top
    10 A03:2021 Injection category. Compare its impact to SQL Injection and debate scenarios where it poses a greater threat,
    citing real-world examples from NIST SP 800-115.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing. Generate\
  \ high-quality, Anki-optimized flashcards for the topic 'OS Command Injection Discovery' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity\
  \ > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Web Application Penetration Testing > 009_Input Validation Testing > Command\
  \ Injection > OS Command Injection Discovery).\n\nIncorporate:\n- Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]\n- Active\
  \ Learning: Use elements to inspire scenario-based cards (e.g., discussion-style eval questions).\n- Scaffolding: Distribute\
  \ cards evenly: 25% Layer 1 (definitions/prior knowledge), 25% Layer 2 (payloads/flow), 25% Layer 3 (tools/labs), 25% Layer\
  \ 4 (OWASP/NIST/integration/mitigations). Full scaffolding details: [insert full scaffolding JSON above].\n- Research Context:\
  \ OS Command Injection via unsafe input to shell (e.g., system()); payloads like '; ls'; standards OWASP Top 10 A03:2021,\
  \ NIST SP 800-115; labs DVWA/bWAPP.\n\nFollow Flashcard Schema exactly: [insert full schema above]. Output ONLY a JSON array\
