active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the risks of enabling TRACE or CONNECT methods on production APIs. Reference
    OWASP guidelines and real-world breaches (e.g., verb tampering leading to broken access control). What mitigations would
    you prioritize, and why? Support with evidence from HTTP standards.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    PUT vs PATCH; safe vs unsafe methods). Distractors: 1 near-miss (similar method), 1 opposite (safe for unsafe), 1 irrelevant
    (non-HTTP). Ensure 1 correct option clearly superior.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing. Topic:
  HTTP Method Testing on APIs (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Web Application Penetration
  Testing > 014_API Testing > REST 006_API Security > HTTP Method Testing on APIs). Use provided learning objectives, active
  learning, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema EXACTLY.


  Incorporate: Voter priorities (OWASP WSTG-CONF-06 full guidance, curl/Burp steps, verb tampering, labs), research (HTTP
  methods defs, REST CRUD), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression, hands-on).


  Generate a deck of 50 flashcards in JSON array. Each card follows schema: {''front'': ''Question'', ''back'': {''answer'':
  ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''source'': ''...'', ''active_element'': ''...''}, ''type'': ''MCQ/short/cloze'', ''bloom_level'':
  ''...'', ''layer'': ''1-4''}.


  Ensure: Distractors per protocol; explanations tie to objectives/scaffolding; 100% educational, safe (lab-only); no real
  exploits. Balance Bloom''s/layers. Output ONLY the JSON array.'
