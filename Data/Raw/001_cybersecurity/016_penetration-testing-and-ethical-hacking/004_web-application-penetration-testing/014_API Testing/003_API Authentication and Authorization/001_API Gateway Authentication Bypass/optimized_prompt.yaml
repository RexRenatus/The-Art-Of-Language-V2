  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''API gateways provide a false sense of security because
    bypass vulnerabilities often stem from misconfigurations rather than inherent flaws.'' Support your view with examples
    from OWASP API Top 10 (e.g., Broken Authentication) and real-world breaches, linking to prerequisites like basic HTTP
    authentication from web app pen testing.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., brute-force as ''bypass''); 2) Misconfig examples (e.g., ''rate limiting failure''); 3) Tool/error swaps (e.g.,
    ''OAuth instead of JWT''). Ensure distractors are realistic from OWASP/research but incorrect for the question.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ethical hacking and penetration
  testing. Topic: API Gateway Authentication Bypass (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking >
  Web Application Penetration Testing > 014_API Testing > API 003_Authentication and Authorization > API Gateway Authentication
  Bypass). Focus on ethical, lab-based learning; emphasize distinguishing true bypasses (misconfigs, logic flaws like missing
  checks, JWT none, parameter pollution, direct backend access) from cracking (brute-force, stuffing). Use research: API gateways
  centralize auth for microservices but fail via routing misrules (e.g., AWS/Kong). Tools: Burp Suite, Postman. OWASP API
  Top 10: Broken Authentication.
