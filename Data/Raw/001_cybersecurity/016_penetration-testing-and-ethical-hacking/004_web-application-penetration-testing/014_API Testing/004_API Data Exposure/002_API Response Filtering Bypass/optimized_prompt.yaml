active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, analyze a real-world breach involving API data exposure (e.g., from OWASP case
    studies). How did response filtering bypass contribute, and what alternative designs could have prevented it? Cite evidence
    from OWASP API Security Top 10.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    but incorrect (e.g., confuse client/server filtering), (2) Partial truths (e.g., valid technique but wrong context), (3)
    OWASP-related red herrings. Ensure they test deeper understanding. Use only for MCQ/true_false types.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing. Generate
  high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for the topic ''API Response Filtering Bypass'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration
  Testing And Ethical Hacking > Web Application Penetration Testing > 014_API Testing > API Data Exposure > API Response Filtering
  Bypass).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active learning: Tie explanations to discussion/peer/problem-solving activities.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers: [INSERT FULL LAYERS FROM ABOVE].

  - Sources: OWASP API Security Top 10 (API3:2019 Excessive Data Exposure, API3:2023 Broken Object Property Level Authorization),
  OWASP WSTG API Testing, PortSwigger Burp Suite docs.

  - Best practices: Server-side filtering, JSON schemas, RBAC, pagination enforcement.

  - Related: IDOR, excessive exposure.


  Output a JSON array of flashcards strictly following this schema: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD_SCHEMA STRUCTURE FROM ABOVE]. Generate
  50 flashcards: balanced by Bloom''s level (8-9 each), layer (12-13 each), type (25% definition, 50% MCQ, 15% true_false,
  10% scenario). Questions must be active/recall-oriented (e.g., ''How would you bypass...?''). Explanations: 2-4 sentences,
  reference objectives/layers/sources, suggest active learning use. Distractors per protocol.


  Ensure pedagogical optimization: Scaffolding builds progressively, objectives measurable, no spoilers in questions.'
