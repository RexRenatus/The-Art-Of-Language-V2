active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between client-side filtering (fast development) and server-side
    filtering (secure) for API responses. Use OWASP API Top 10 examples and real-world breaches (e.g., data leaks from unfiltered
    APIs) to argue which should be standard practice and why, considering performance vs. security.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the 6 objectives above].

  - Active Learning: Inspire critical thinking with discussion/peer/problem-solving elements in explanations.

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste the 4 layers content above].

  - Research: OWASP API Top 10 (API3:2019), client-side filtering risks, PII leaks. Sources: OWASP.org/API-Security, indusface.com/blog/api32019-excessive-data-exposure,
  prophaze.com/learn/api/what-is-excessive-data-exposure, docs.brightsec.com/docs/excessive-data-exposure.

  - Best Practices: Server-side filtering, least privilege, API gateways (data masking), field-level auth, GraphQL selectors.

  - JSON Examples: Vulnerable (full PII), Secure (minimal).


  Output 30 flashcards in JSON array format, each strictly following this schema: [paste flashcard_schema.structure above].
  Ensure progression: lower Bloom''s first. Use distractor protocol. Explanations: 100-200 words, pedagogical (e.g., ''Apply
  by analyzing this JSON...''). No duplicates; cover all objectives/layers/tools/mitigations/compliance.'
