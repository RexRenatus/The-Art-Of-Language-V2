  Incorporate this research context: Credential caching stores login info (usernames/passwords/session tokens) locally for
  convenience but risks exploitation via physical access, malware, or pentesting. Key mechanisms: cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage,
  IndexedDB, password managers. Browsers: Chrome (%LocalAppData%/Google/Chrome/User Data/Default/Login Data SQLite), Firefox
  (cookies.sqlite, key4.db), Safari (Keychain). Risks: Unauthorized access to sessions. Standards: NIST SP 800-53 IA-5 (Authenticator
  Management: Protect authenticators from compromise), NIST SP 800-63B (secure storage), OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet
  (avoid client-side storage of sensitive auth data), OWASP Session Management (HttpOnly/Secure/SameSite). Sources: OWASP.org,
  NIST.gov publications, Chrome/Firefox dev docs.
