active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of adopting FIDO2/WebAuthn versus traditional password-based authentication in
    enterprise environments. Consider real-world adoptions (e.g., Google, Microsoft) and potential implementation pitfalls—provide
    evidence from OWASP or NIST to support your position.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: [PASTE FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding: [PASTE FULL 4 LAYERS FROM ABOVE]


  Use Flashcard Schema: [PASTE FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Ensure university pedagogy: Bloom''s progression, active recall, spaced
  repetition best practices. Ground in research: Passwordless shift, pen testing for exploits like signature malleability.


  Prior Knowledge: Assume learners know basic auth testing (OWASP 006).


  Generate 40-50 flashcards as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
