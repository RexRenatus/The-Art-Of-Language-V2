active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, select one attack vector (SIM swap, SS7 vulnerability, malware, phishing) and one mitigation (e.g.,
    authenticator apps, number verification). Explain the mechanism and teach-back to the group, addressing common misconceptions
    like 'SMS is secure because it's tied to your phone number.'
  problem_solving: 'Lab exercise: In a virtual environment (e.g., using SS7 simulators or phishing kits like Gophish), simulate
    a SIM swap or OTP phishing attack on a test web app. Propose and implement defenses (e.g., switch to TOTP), then document
    findings in an ethical hacking report.'

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards optimized for university-level pedagogy using Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives: [insert
  learning_objectives array here]. Incorporate active learning: [insert active_learning here]. Follow 4 scaffolding layers:
  [insert scaffolding_layers here].


  Use this research context: [insert full Research Context from input]. Complete truncated sections per voter consensus: Detail
  SS7 (no auth/encryption, interception via signaling; GSMA/Krebs), attack vectors (SIM swap, malware, phishing, rogue towers),
  mitigations (TOTP, push, FIDO2, hardware tokens).


  Output ONLY in JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"type": "MCQ|Definition|TrueFalse|Application", "front": "Question text
  with options if MCQ", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "Detailed rationale, Bloom''s level, layer, source, misconception
