active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of strict vs. lenient lockout thresholds (e.g., security
    vs. usability/DoS risks). Reference NIST guidelines and real-world examples from sources like EC-Council to propose balanced
    policies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
