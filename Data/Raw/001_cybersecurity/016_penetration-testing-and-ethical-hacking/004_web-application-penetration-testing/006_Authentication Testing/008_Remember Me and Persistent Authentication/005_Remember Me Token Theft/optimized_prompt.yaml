active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue the trade-offs between user convenience of RM tokens and security risks like
    session hijacking. Use real-world examples (e.g., LinkedIn 2012 breach) to support your position and reference OWASP guidelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    OWASP categories). Ensure 70% misconception-based, 30% edge cases.'

  ''Remember Me Token Theft'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Web Application Penetration
  Testing > 006_Authentication Testing > Remember Me and Persistent Authentication > Remember Me Token Theft). Use this optimized
  structure to generate 25 high-quality flashcards.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the ''learning_objectives'' array here].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the ''scaffolding'' array here]. Distribute flashcards: 6 Layer 1, 7 Layer 2, 7 Layer 3,
  5 Layer 4.


  **Active Learning Hooks:** Incorporate brief ties to [Insert ''active_learning'' object here] in explanations.


  **Research Context:** RM tokens (persistent cookies for auto-login) stolen via XSS, MitM, malware, phishing; leads to session
  hijacking/ATO. OWASP Top 10: A07:2021 (Auth Failures), A02:2021 (Crypto Failures), A05:2021 (Misconfig). Mitigations: HttpOnly/Secure/SameSite
  cookies, short expiry, binding. Sources: OWASP Session Management Cheat Sheet, NIST SP 800-63B.


  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly follow [Insert ''flashcard_schema'' object here]. Output as JSON array of objects, each with
  ''front'' and ''back'' (nested object). Ensure Bloom''s progression, measurable verbs, and distractor protocol. Prioritize
  university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition friendly.'
