  discussion_prompt: 'Discuss the implications of NIST''s shift from complexity rules to length and passphrases: How does
    this balance security and user experience in web app pen-testing? Provide examples of real-world breaches influenced by
    poor policies (e.g., reference LinkedIn or Yahoo breaches).'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active learning: Weave in prompts like NIST shift discussions, peer cracking demos, Burp Suite exercises.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers [INSERT FULL LAYERS FROM ABOVE].

  - Research: NIST SP 800-63B/4 (length ≥8, no forced complexity, passphrases > complex shorts; screen breaches); Canadian
  Cyber Centre (usability focus); attacks (brute-force/Hashcat, dictionary, phishing, keyloggers). Best practices: passphrases
  (e.g., ''correct horse battery staple''), avoid patterns/reuse, pen-test via Burp (forms, errors).

  - Concept map: Central ''Password Complexity Rules'' → Length, Variety, NIST, Attacks, Practices (Passphrases), Integration.


  Generate 25 flashcards in JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {answer: ''...'', explanation: ''...'', bloom_level:
  ''...'', layer: ''...'', distractors: [{text:''...'', explanation:''...''}, ... (exactly 3)] }}].

  Follow schema exactly [INSERT FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Ensure measurable, active, scaffolded output. Prioritize pen-testing:
  Burp Suite, policy critique.'
