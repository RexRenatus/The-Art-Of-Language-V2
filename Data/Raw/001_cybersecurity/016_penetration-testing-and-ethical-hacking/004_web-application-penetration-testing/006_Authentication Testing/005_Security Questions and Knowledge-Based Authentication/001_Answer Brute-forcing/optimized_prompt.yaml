  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the ongoing use of security questions in modern authentication: Are they
    a relic of poor design (citing NIST SP 800-63B''s recommendation against KBA), or do they have niche value? Support with
    examples of real-world breaches involving answer brute-forcing.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Plausible misconceptions (e.g., confuse with password brute-forcing: ''Requires 10^12 attempts'' vs. actual low entropy).'
    - Similar terms (e.g., 'Dictionary attack' as distractor for 'brute-force').
    - Edge cases (e.g., 'Only works on weak passwords' instead of KBA specifics).
    - Standards mix-up (e.g., 'NIST recommends KBA' vs. 'discourages').
    - 'Generate 3 per MCQ: 1 common error, 1 related concept, 1 irrelevant but sounds technical.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing. Topic:
  ''Answer Brute-forcing'' (Level 6 in hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Web Application
  Penetration Testing > 006_Authentication Testing > Security Questions and Knowledge-Based Authentication > Answer Brute-forcing).
  Focus exclusively on brute-forcing answers to security questions (KBA, e.g., ''mother''s maiden name''), distinguishing
  from password brute-forcing. Prior knowledge: Basic auth concepts.
