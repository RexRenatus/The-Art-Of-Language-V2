  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the effectiveness of security questions in modern authentication systems: Discuss pros (e.g.,
    user-friendly recovery), cons (e.g., vulnerability to OSINT and social engineering), alternatives like MFA or biometrics,
    and reference real-world pentest case studies from breaches involving KBA bypass.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    always secure if personal''), 2) Partial truth (e.g., mixes strong/weak traits), 3) Extreme/opposite (e.g., ''Use only
    public data for questions''); ensure they test nuanced understanding without being obvious.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and
  Ethical Hacking. Generate high-quality, pedagogically optimized flashcards for the topic ''Question Selection and Customization''
  in the hierarchy: Level 1: Cybersecurity > Level 2: Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Level 3: Web Application Penetration
  Testing > Level 4: 006_Authentication Testing > Level 5: Security Questions and Knowledge-Based Authentication > Level 6:
  Question Selection and Customization.


  Core content focus: Security questions are user-provided answers to personal queries (e.g., ''first pet?'', ''mother''s
  maiden name?'') used in KBA for auth recovery. Vulnerabilities: Predictable via OSINT (social media, theHarvester), social
  engineering, data breaches. Pentesting: Profile targets, select weak questions (personal info), customize attacks (brute-force
  common answers, automation). Strong questions: Unique, non-public events. Examples: Weak (''high school name''), Strong
  (''name of first street you lived on after age 10, excluding family'').
