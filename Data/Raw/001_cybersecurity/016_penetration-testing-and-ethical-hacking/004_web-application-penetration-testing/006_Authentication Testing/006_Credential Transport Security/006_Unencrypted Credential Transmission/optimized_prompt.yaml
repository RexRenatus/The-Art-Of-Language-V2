  discussion_prompt: In a world with performance constraints on IoT devices, should developers always enforce encrypted credential
    transmission, or are there acceptable risks? Debate pros and cons with evidence from standards like NIST SP 800-63 and
    OWASP guidelines, considering factors like latency, battery life, and attack surfaces.

  **Full Research Context (Completed and Web-Grounded):**

  Unencrypted credential transmission sends auth info (usernames/passwords) in plain text over networks (e.g., HTTP), vulnerable
  to interception (MitM, sniffing). Core concepts: plain-text, credentials, interception, pen testing. Risks: credential theft
  leading to account takeover.

  **Industry Standards:** NIST SP 800-63B (requires TLS 1.2+ for credential service providers); OWASP Top 10 A07:2021 Identification/Authentication
  Failures (insecure transport); OWASP ASVS V2 (TLS enforcement, no plain-text auth); CISA Best Practices (completed): ''Use
  HTTPS Everywhere'' - Enforce TLS for all auth traffic; redirect HTTP to HTTPS; implement HSTS; avoid HTTP in internal networks
  (CISA Alert AA20-133A, Secure Config for Cloud). PCI-DSS 4.0 Req 4: Encrypt transmission over public nets.

  **Pen Testing Techniques:** 1. Recon: Check site for HTTP forms (Burp Spider). 2. Intercept: Burp Proxy/Wireshark (filter:
  http.request.method=="POST" && frame contains "pass"). 3. Analyze: Look for base64/plain creds. Example: POST /login HTTP/1.1
  ... user=admin&password=secret. 4. Report: CVSS score ~7.5 (High).

  **Remediation:** Mandate HTTPS, TLS 1.3, perfect forward secrecy; tools: sslscan, testssl.sh.

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers from above].

  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Weave in prompts/examples (e.g., IoT debate for evaluate cards; Wireshark sim for apply).


  **Generation Rules:** Strictly follow flashcard_schema. Balance: 40% Layer1/Foundation (Remember), 20% Layer2/Components
  (Understand), 20% Layer3/Implementation (Apply/Analyze), 20% Layer4/Integration (Evaluate/Create). Output as JSON array
  of objects, each with ''type'' (q_and_a or mcq), ''front'', ''back'' (per schema), ''metadata'' (Bloom level, layer, hierarchy
  tag). Ensure flashcards promote active recall, misconceptions via distractors, and pentest realism. No spoilers in front.'
