active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between user experience (e.g., `autocomplete=on` for convenience in non-sensitive
    forms) and security (e.g., `autocomplete=off` for passwords). In which real-world scenarios (e.g., banking apps vs. e-commerce
    checkouts) might one priority outweigh the other, and why? Provide evidence from browser behaviors or OWASP recommendations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
