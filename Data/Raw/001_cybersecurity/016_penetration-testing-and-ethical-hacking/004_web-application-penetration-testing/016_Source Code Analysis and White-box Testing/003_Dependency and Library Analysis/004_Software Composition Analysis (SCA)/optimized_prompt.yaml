active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, analyze a sample package.json file from a vulnerable web app repo (e.g., on GitHub). One partner
    teaches the other about identifying direct vs. transitive dependencies and associated risks; then switch roles and peer-review
    each other's explanations.
  problem_solving: Using a free SCA tool like OWASP Dependency-Check, scan a deliberately vulnerable project repository (e.g.,
    a sample Node.js or Java web app with known deps like vulnerable Log4j). Identify top risks, prioritize them by CVSS score,
    propose fixes, and document an SBOM for reporting in a pentesting engagement.

    audited/safe''); 2) Partial truths (e.g., mix direct/transitive defs); 3) Real-world examples twisted (e.g., Log4Shell
    as ''license issue''); 4) Tool confusions (e.g., Snyk as runtime scanner only). Ensure distractors promote critical thinking.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing. Generate
  50 high-quality flashcards on ''003_Software Composition Analysis (SCA)'' in Web Application Penetration Testing, grounded
  in the provided context.


  **Topic Hierarchy:** Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Web Application Penetration Testing > 016_Source
  Code Analysis and White-box Testing > Dependency and Library Analysis > 003_Software Composition Analysis (SCA).


  **Incorporate these exactly:**

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the full array from ''learning_objectives'']

  - Active Learning: [paste the full object from ''active_learning''] – Tie flashcards to these (e.g., cards with prompts
  like ''Debate: Is SCA sufficient for Log4Shell?'')

  - Scaffolding: [paste the full object from ''scaffolding''] – Tag each card with layer.

  - Big Picture: SCA automates OSS risk detection (90%+ apps use OSS); critical for supply chain attacks (e.g., Log4Shell
  CVE-2021-44228).

  - Tools: OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, Dependabot.

  - Sources: OWASP.org/projects/dependency-check, snyk.io/learn/software-composition-analysis-sca, cisa.gov/sbom, nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228.


  **Output Format:** JSON array of objects, strictly following this schema: [paste the full ''structure'', ''distractor_protocol'',
  ''explanation_requirements'' from ''flashcard_schema'']. No extra text.


  **Best Practices:** Use Bloom''s progression; active recall (questions test application); scaffolding (build layers); university
  pedagogy (measurable, higher-order); web-grounded (real tools/examples). Ensure flashcards enable peer teaching/discussion/problem-solving.
  Vary difficulty; include diagrams in explanations if textual (e.g., ''Dependency tree: A->B->C(vuln)'').'
