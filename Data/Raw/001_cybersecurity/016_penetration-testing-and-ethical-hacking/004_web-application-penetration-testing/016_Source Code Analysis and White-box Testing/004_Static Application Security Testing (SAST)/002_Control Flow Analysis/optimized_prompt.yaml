  discussion_prompt: "Analyze this vulnerable code snippet:\n```java\npublic void authenticate(HttpServletRequest request)\
    \ {\n  String username = request.getParameter(\"username\");\n  String role = request.getParameter(\"role\");\n  if (username.equals(\"\
    admin\") || request.getParameter(\"override\") != null) {\n    grantAdminAccess();\n  } else {\n    denyAccess();\n  }\n\

    \ via parameter manipulation for broken access control) and why, referencing OWASP Top 10 (A01:2021 Broken Access Control)\
    \ guidelines."
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Research Context: CFA is static analysis to map program execution paths via basic blocks, CFGs, and paths. Key: Static Code
  Analysis (no execution), Data Flow Analysis (complements CFA), Basic Block, Control Flow Path. Used in SAST for vuln detection
  like auth bypass. Tools: FlowDroid, Joern, PMD, CodeQL, Semgrep. Best Practices: Integrate into SDLC/CI/CD for early feedback
  to developers on logic flaws (e.g., bypassable if-statements). Sources: OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/stable/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/11-Source_Code_Manipulation),
