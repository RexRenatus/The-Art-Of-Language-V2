  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the following: ''How does out-of-order step execution differ from other
    business logic flaws like parameter tampering, and why might developers overlook it in multi-step workflows like e-commerce
    checkouts? Provide real-world examples from OWASP or known breaches.'' Encourage critical thinking by requiring participants
    to cite evidence and counterarguments.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    similar vulns (race conditions, parameter tampering); 3) Edge cases (legit parallel processing); 4) Common pentest myths.
    Ensure 70% accuracy in fooling novices but clear debunking in explanations.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing. Topic:
  **Out-of-order Step Execution** (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Web Application Penetration
  Testing > 012_Business Logic Testing > Workflow Circumvention > Out-of-order Step Execution). CRITICAL: Use the CORRECTED
  definition per expert consensus – a BUSINESS LOGIC VULNERABILITY where attackers execute multi-step web app workflows OUT-OF-SEQUENCE
  to bypass controls (e.g., redeem rewards without purchase via Burp-reordered requests). AVOID the misconception of ''tester
  methodology flexibility''.
