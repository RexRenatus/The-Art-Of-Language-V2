active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios could discount code stacking testing be considered a legitimate penetration test versus
    fraudulent activity? Debate the ethical boundaries using real-world e-commerce examples like Black Friday promotions,
    considering authorization, intent, and potential business impact.
  peer_teaching: 'Pair students: One student explains the technical exploit of discount code stacking using Burp Suite (e.g.,
    parameter tampering demo), while the other teaches a mitigation strategy (e.g., server-side validation and session tracking).
    Switch roles and provide feedback on clarity and accuracy.'
  problem_solving: 'Provide a vulnerable web app scenario (e.g., DVWA or a Dockerized e-commerce simulator). Students must:
    1) Identify potential stacking points in the transaction flow; 2) Exploit using Burp Suite; 3) Calculate potential fraud
    loss (e.g., 50%+ discount on $1000 order); 4) Report findings with remediation recommendations. Extend to real-world ethical
    hacking reports.'

    Partial truth (e.g., client-side only fix), 3) Unrelated vuln/tool (e.g., SQLi or Wireshark).'
  - Base on voter suggestions (e.g., ethics boundaries, tool misuse) and research (e.g., OWASP links).
  - Ensure distractors test deeper understanding, not trivia.

  Core Content: Discount code stacking is exploiting business logic to apply multiple discounts to one transaction via parameter
  tampering (e.g., Burp). Mitigations: Server-side checks.
