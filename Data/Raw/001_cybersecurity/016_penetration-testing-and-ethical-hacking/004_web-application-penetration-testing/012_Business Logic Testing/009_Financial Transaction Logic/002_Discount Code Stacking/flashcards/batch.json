If the application applies the '10% off' first, then checks if the remaining total meets the '$100' threshold for the second coupon, what is the potential business logic issue?",
      "correct_answer": "The threshold for the '$20 Off' coupon might not be met due to the initial percentage discount, preventing a valid discount combination that might have been intended.",

        "core_logic": "The issue arises because the order of application affects whether the condition for the second discount ('Buy \\(100') is met. If the 10% off reduces the total below \\)100, the second discount is missed, indicating flawed logic in handling combined promotions.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly focus on the initial discount's validity, CSRF, or the restrictiveness of the business rule itself, rather than the logical flaw in how the two discounts interact.",
