active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the relative risks of Azure CDN endpoint takeover versus traditional subdomain
    takeover. Consider factors like impact scale, detection difficulty, and real-world examples. Support your arguments with
    references to Microsoft documentation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing. Topic:
  Azure CDN Endpoint Takeover (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Web Application Penetration
  Testing > 013_004_Configuration and Deployment Management Testing > Subdomain Takeover and DNS Issues > Azure CDN Endpoint
  Takeover).


  Research Context: Azure CDN endpoint takeover occurs when attackers claim control of a deleted/misconfigured CDN endpoint
  via dangling DNS CNAME records (e.g., to xxxx.azureedge.net). Attack vectors: Compromised creds (phishing), dangling records.
  Detection: dnsrecon, Subjack, Azure CLI (''az cdn endpoint list --resource-group RG --profile-name PROFILE''). Mitigation:
  Delete endpoints fully before DNS removal, RBAC, custom domain cert validation, Azure Sentinel alerts. Tools: dnsrecon,
  Subjack. Standards: OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (Config Management), Microsoft Azure Well-Architected
  Framework Security Pillar, NIST SP 800-53. Sources: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cdn/, https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cdn/cdn-custom-domain,
  OWASP Subdomain Takeover Cheat Sheet, Azure Security Center docs.
