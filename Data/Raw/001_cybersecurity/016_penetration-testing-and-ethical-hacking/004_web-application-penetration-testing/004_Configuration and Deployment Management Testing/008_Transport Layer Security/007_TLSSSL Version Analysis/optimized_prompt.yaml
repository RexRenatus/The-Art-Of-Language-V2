active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the risks and benefits of completely disabling legacy TLS versions (e.g.,
    TLS 1.0/1.1) on production servers. Consider compatibility with legacy clients versus modern security standards like NIST
    SP 800-52. Support arguments with real-world examples from breaches like Heartbleed or POODLE.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives** (span Bloom''s): [insert full list above].

  - **Active Learning**: Embed hooks in explanations (e.g., ''Apply in peer teaching: Run this command'').

  - **Scaffolding**: Distribute cards across 4 layers – 25% Layer 1 (Foundation), 25% Layer 2 (Components), 25% Layer 3 (Implementation),
  25% Layer 4 (Integration) [insert full descriptions above].

  - **Research Context**: Core concepts (TLS/SSL protocols, versions SSLv2-TLS1.3, vulns: POODLE/SSLv3, BEAST/TLS1.0, vulns
  in weak ciphers); Standards: NIST SP 800-52r2 (TLS guidelines), RFC 8446 (TLS1.3), PCI DSS v4.0 Req 4.1 (TLS1.2+), OWASP
  Testing Guide v4 (WSTG-CRYP-03), OWASP TLS Cheat Sheet. Tools: nmap ssl-enum-ciphers, testssl.sh, openssl s_client, SSL
  Labs scanner. Concept map: Central ''TLS/SSL Version Analysis'' → ''Versions (timeline)'', ''Vulns (POODLE,BEAST)'', ''Tools
  (nmap,testssl)'', ''Standards (NIST,PCI,OWASP)'' → links to pen testing.


  **Output Format**: JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''tags'': [''...''],
  ''layer'': ''1-4'', ''bloom_level'': ''remember|understand|apply|analyze|evaluate|create''}]. Follow Flashcard Schema exactly
  [insert full schema above]. Ensure completeness, pedagogy, and 84.3% voter-approved focus on tools/procedures/standards.
  Generate high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized cards.'
