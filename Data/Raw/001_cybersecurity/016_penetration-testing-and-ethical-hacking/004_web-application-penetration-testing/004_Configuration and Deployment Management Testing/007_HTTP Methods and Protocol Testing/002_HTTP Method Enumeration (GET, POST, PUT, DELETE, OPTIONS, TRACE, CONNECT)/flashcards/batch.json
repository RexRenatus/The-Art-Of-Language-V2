        "core_logic": "Since PUT allows uploading/replacing resources, testing its security involves attempting to upload malicious files (like web shells) that could be executed by the server, especially if the application doesn't properly validate file types and content.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Uploading a web shell tests the most common and dangerous exploit scenario for insecure PUT endpoints. Overwriting system files, GET requests, and DELETE requests are less direct tests of the PUT upload vulnerability.",
        "analogy": "If you find a mailbox (PUT endpoint) where people can leave packages, you should test if someone could leave a dangerous item instead of a normal package."
