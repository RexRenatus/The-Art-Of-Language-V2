active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the pros and cons of implementing a default-deny firewall policy versus a default-allow policy
    in a corporate environment. Consider factors like security, usability, and maintenance overhead. Provide real-world examples
    from recent breaches (e.g., misconfigured rules in the SolarWinds attack) where poor rule configuration played a role.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    based on common misconceptions (e.g., ''Default-Allow'' as distractor for policy; confuse ports 80/443 with 22; mix rule
    order as ''bottom-up''). Ensure progressive difficulty: Layer 1 (basic errors), Layer 4 (subtle evasion flaws). No ''all/none''

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on ''Firewall Rule Testing'' (Category:
  Cybersecurity > Penetration Testing And Ethical Hacking > Web Application Penetration Testing > 013_004_Configuration and
  Deployment Management Testing > Network and Infrastructure Configuration > Firewall Rule Testing). Consensus: 82.9% approval
  from 7 voters.


  **Core Content Integration:**

  - Foundation: Firewall (traffic monitor/barrier), Rules (IP/port/protocol/action), Policy (ACL guidelines), Pentesting (simulated
  attacks).

  - Best Practices: 1. Default-Deny with Explicit Allows. 2. Least Privilege. 3. Order Specific-to-General. 4. Enable Logging/Monitoring.
  5. Regular Audits/Reviews. 6. Disable Unused Rules. 7. Stateful Inspection. 8. Network Segmentation. 9. Test in Staging.
  10. Document Changes.

  - Tools: nmap, hping3, nc/telnet.

  - Sources: PurpleSec.us/firewall-penetration-testing, Tufin.com/blog/firewall-policy-management, NIST SP 800-41 Rev1 (nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-41r1.pdf),

  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s):** [Insert the learning_objectives array here].

  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Inspire cards from discussion (default-deny debate), peer teaching (rule diagramming), problem-solving
  (web app scenario).

  **Scaffolding:** Distribute cards: 15% Layer1, 25% Layer2, 30% Layer3, 30% Layer4. [Insert scaffolding details].


  **Generation Rules:**

  - Cover all objectives/layers evenly.

  - 20% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 30% APPLY/ANALYZE, 30% EVALUATE, 20% CREATE.

  - Variety: 30% Q&A, 40% MCQ (with distractors), 20% Cloze, 10% Diagram prompts.

  - Ensure measurable, active recall (no pure definitions).

  - Link to prior knowledge (TCP/IP, ports).

  - Voter priorities: Completeness (full best practices), pedagogy (progressive Bloom''s).


  **Output Format:** JSON array of 50 objects, each matching flashcard_schema exactly. No extra text.'
