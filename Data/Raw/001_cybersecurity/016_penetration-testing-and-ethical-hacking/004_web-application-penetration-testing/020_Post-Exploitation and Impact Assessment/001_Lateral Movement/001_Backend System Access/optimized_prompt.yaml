active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the most critical OWASP WSTG sections (e.g., 4.5 Authorization Testing,
    4.12 Session Management, 4.13 Error Handling) for preventing backend system access via lateral movement. Provide real-world
    examples from breaches and propose mitigations, referencing prior web vulnerabilities like SSRF or SQLi.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Ethical Hacking. Generate 75 high-quality flashcards on ''Backend System Access'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Penetration
  Testing And Ethical Hacking > Web Application Penetration Testing > Post-005_Exploitation and Impact Assessment > Lateral
  Movement > Backend System Access). Integrate university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives [insert learning_objectives
  array here verbatim], active learning activities [insert active_learning here verbatim], 4-layer scaffolding [insert scaffolding
