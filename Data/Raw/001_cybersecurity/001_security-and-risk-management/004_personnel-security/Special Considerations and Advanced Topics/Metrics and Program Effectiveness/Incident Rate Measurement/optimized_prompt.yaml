  discussion_prompt: 'Debate in groups: ''Is incident rate alone sufficient to measure security program effectiveness?'' Use
    NIST CSF 2.0 examples (e.g., Detect/Respond functions) and personnel security scenarios like insider threats to argue
    pros/cons, then vote and summarize consensus.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
