active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of centralizing vs. decentralizing emergency contact management in an Emergency
    Services Sector (ESS) organization during a cyber incident. Consider factors like accessibility, security, update frequency,
    and compliance with NIST SP 800-61.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
