  discussion_prompt: In the event of a major ransomware attack on critical infrastructure like a hospital, debate whether
    organizations should prioritize full transparency with the public or controlled disclosure to avoid aiding attackers.
    Reference NIST CSF 'Respond' (RS.CO) and 'Recover' functions, legal obligations (e.g., GDPR notifications within 72 hours),
    and risk management principles. Consider impacts on public trust, operational recovery, and attacker behavior.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  ### Full Research Context

  Effective crisis communication is critical in cybersecurity for minimizing damage and maintaining trust. Core Concepts:
  Crisis Communication (strategic internal/external protocols - Wire.com); Cybersecurity Incident (jeopardizes CIA/violates
  policies - NIST SP 800-61r3); Cyber Crisis (large-scale escalation - ENISA); Incident Response (Preparation, Detection/Analysis,
  Containment/Eradication/Recovery, Post-Incident - NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3, full guide at https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r3.pdf).
  Frameworks: NIST CSF RS.CO (Communications coordination); best practices (pre-defined trees, templates, escalation - NIST/ENISA).
  Integration: Align with BCP/DR.
