      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "NIST SP 800-63B mandates that AAL2 requires proof of possession of two distinct authentication factors via secure protocols, ensuring higher confidence because compromising multiple independent factors is significantly harder than compromising just one. Approved cryptographic techniques are also required at this level.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly describe MFA at AAL2 by suggesting single-factor use, optional cryptography, or AAL3-specific hardware/impersonation resistance requirements, all contradicting NIST guidelines.",
        "analogy": "It's like needing both a key (something you have) and a password (something you know) to access a secure system, ensuring that just having one isn't enough for unauthorized access."
