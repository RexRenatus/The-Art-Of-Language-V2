        "core_logic": "Documenting incident response activities and outcomes is crucial because it provides the raw data for 'lessons learned,' which drives continuous improvement in risk management and response procedures. Furthermore, this documentation serves as an essential audit trail for compliance, accountability, and potential legal or forensic investigations.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors limit the purpose of documentation to passive archiving, automatic policy generation, or solely legal evidence, overlooking its vital role in active learning, process improvement, and operational accountability.",
        "analogy": "Documenting a complex project's steps and results is like keeping detailed notes during a scientific experiment; it allows others to understand what was done, replicate successes, learn from failures, and verify the findings later."
