    checks (to mitigate insider threats) with EEOC requirements to avoid disparate impact on protected classes? Provide examples
    and debate potential trade-offs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

      as discrimination); 3. Irrelevant cybersecurity terms (e.g., CIA triad as distractor); 4. Outdated laws (e.g., pre-EEOC
      updates); ensure 1 best answer clearly superior.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Personnel Security under
  Security and Risk Management. Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Personnel Security > Special
  Considerations and Advanced Topics > Compliance and Legal Considerations > EEOC Non-Discrimination Requirements.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on EEOC Non-Discrimination Requirements, refocused on employment laws (Title VII, ADA,
  etc.) applied to cybersecurity personnel security (fair hiring, background checks without bias, avoiding disparate impact).
  Ignore mismatched info sec content like FISMA/NIST CIA triad unless integrated (e.g., compliance links).
