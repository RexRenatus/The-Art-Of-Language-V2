active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the most critical NIST PS control (e.g., PS-3 Personnel Screening vs. PS-4
    Termination) for preventing insider threats in SOX-compliant financial reporting. Support your position with real-world
    examples from PCAOB audit findings and propose improvements.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1 common misconception (e.g., confuse PS-3 screening with
    PS-4 termination), 1 related but irrelevant control (e.g., from Access Control family), 1 exaggerated/understated version
    (e.g., ''no screening required for contractors''). Ensure distractors test nuance in SOX/NIST alignment.'

  Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities, scaffolding layers (1-4), and flashcard schema to generate
  high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards. Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Prior knowledge: CIA Triad, basic SOX.

  - Full NIST SP 800-53 PS controls: PS-1 Policy/Procedures, PS-2 Position Risk, PS-3 Screening (background/credit checks),
  PS-4 Termination (access revocation within 24h), PS-5 Transfer, PS-6 Access Agreements (NDA/signatures), PS-7 Third-Party,
  PS-8 Sanctions.

  - SOX Section 404 alignment: Internal controls for financial reporting integrity.

  - Sources: Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 (https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/3763), NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5
  (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r5), PCAOB AS5 (https://pcaobus.org/oversight/standards/auditing-standards/details/AS2201),
  COSO Framework.


  Synthesize content progressively per scaffolding layers. Ensure active learning ties (e.g., scenario-based cards from problem-solving).
  Follow flashcard schema exactly, including distractor protocol and explanations. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards,
  each as: {"type": "Basic/MCQ/Cloze", "front": "...", "back": "...", "layer": 1-4, "blooms_level": "Remember/etc.", "tags":
  ["SOX", "NIST-PS"]}. Generate 40-50 unique, non-redundant cards spanning all Bloom''s levels.'
