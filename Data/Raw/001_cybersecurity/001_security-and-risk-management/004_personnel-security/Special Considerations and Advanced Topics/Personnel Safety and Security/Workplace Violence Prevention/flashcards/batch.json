        {
          "text": "Prevention is about physical security, while response is about policy.",
          "misconception": "Targets [scope confusion]: Incorrectly limits prevention to physical security and response to policy."

        {
          "text": "Prevention applies only to external threats, while response includes internal threats.",

          "text": "Prevention is a one-time training, while response is ongoing.",
          "misconception": "Targets [process misunderstanding]: Misrepresents prevention as a single event rather than continuous effort."

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The core distinction lies in timing and objective: prevention aims to avert incidents by managing risks proactively, because stopping violence before it starts is the ultimate goal. Response, conversely, manages the immediate aftermath, functioning through established protocols for active events or their consequences.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The correct answer clearly delineates the proactive nature of prevention versus the reactive nature of response, while distractors create false dichotomies or misrepresent the scope and duration of each.",
        "analogy": "Workplace violence prevention is like building a strong fence around a property to keep intruders out; incident response is what you do if someone breaches the fence."
