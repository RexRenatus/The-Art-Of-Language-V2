active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a company experiencing frequent phishing incidents, debate whether new hire security orientation should
    prioritize technical skills training or behavioral awareness techniques first, using NIST SP 800-50 and AT-2 as references.
    What are the pros/cons and evidence for each approach?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Core Content Summary (completed and sourced):

  - New Hire Security Orientation introduces policies, threats, responsibilities per NIST SP 800-50 Rev. 1 (''Building an
  Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program'' - lifecycle: Design, Develop, Deliver, Assess knowledge,
  Evaluate program, Revise). NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 AT-2: ''Provide security awareness training on recognizing/reporting insider
  threat indicators; update content [organization-defined frequency, e.g., annually] following [events, e.g., incidents].
  Emphasize techniques like role-based content, interactive methods, metrics.'' AT-1: Develop/maintain policy/procedures.

  - Objectives: Awareness, policy adherence, responsibility, culture, mitigation.

  Use these exact Learning Objectives, Active Learning activities, Scaffolding Layers, and Flashcard Schema:

  [Insert full learning_objectives, active_learning, scaffolding_layers, flashcard_schema from JSON here].


  Generate 50 flashcards following the schema precisely. Ensure 40% basic recall, 30% application/analysis, 30% evaluation/creation.
  Distribute evenly across 4 layers. Tie explanations to NIST, real-world examples (e.g., phishing breaches), and active learning
  (e.g., ''This relates to the peer teaching activity''). Output as JSON array: [{''front'': {''question'': ''...'', ''options'':
  [''A. ...'', ''B. ...'', ''C. ...'', ''D. ...'']}, ''back'': {''correct_answer'': ''B. ...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''source'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''Layer 2''}}]. No additional text.'
