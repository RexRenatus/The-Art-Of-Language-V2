active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a post-pandemic world, debate whether remote work has increased or decreased overall organizational
    security risks. Use NIST CSF functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) to support your arguments, addressing
    misconceptions like 'home networks are safer than office ones.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: (1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Home networks
    are safer''); (2) Partial truths (e.g., ''Password only'' vs. MFA); (3) Irrelevant but related terms (e.g., ''Antivirus''
    instead of ''VPN''); Ensure distractors test deeper understanding, not trivia.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Remote Work Security Training
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Personnel Security > During Employment Security > Security
  Awareness and Training > Remote Work Security Training).


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema provided below. Cover all 4 scaffolding layers progressively,
  align with these Bloom''s Taxonomy learning objectives [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ''learning_objectives''], and integrate voter
  priorities: NIST CSF, ISO 27001 (Annex A.7 awareness), CIS Controls, CISA guidelines, best practices (VPN, MFA, secure WiFi,
  device management, phishing), real-world examples (Zoom-bombing), concept map elements.


  Incorporate research context: Remote work expands attack surface; cyber hygiene basics; human error reduction via CAT; NIST
  CSF functions.


  Embed active learning hooks: 2-3 cards reference discussion (remote risks debate), peer teaching (hygiene practices), problem-solving
  (public WiFi phishing case).
