    training compare to technical controls like email filters in stopping phishing attacks at Phase One of the attack cycle?
    Use real-world examples from CISA reports to support your arguments.'

  Awareness (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Personnel Security > During Employment Security
  > Security Awareness and Training > Phishing and Social Engineering Awareness).


  Incorporate:

  - Research: Phishing (impersonation via email/smishing/vishing for credentials/malware; CISA attack cycle ''Stop at Phase
  One''); Social Engineering (psychological manipulation); NIST SP 800-50 (awareness programs), SP 800-53 (controls); Real
  examples (spear-phishing, BEC).

  - Pedagogy: Bloom''s objectives (as listed), 4-layer scaffolding (Foundation: defs/types/prior knowledge; Components: cycle/concept
  map; Implementation: detect/respond; Integration: human firewall/risk mgmt), active learning (discussion/peer teach/problem-solve).

  - Big picture: Builds ''human firewall'' in awareness training.

  - Voters: Completeness (full NIST), progressive complexity, concept map (textual: Phishing → Types/Stages/Defenses/Standards).


  Generate 20-30 high-quality flashcards using the EXACT schema:

  - Types: 40% Basic Q&A (remember/understand), 40% MCQ (apply/analyze), 20% Cloze (evaluate/create).

  - Balance: 25% per scaffolding layer.

  - Distractors: Plausible (misconceptions, related terms, partial truths).

  - Each card: Explanation with rationale, scaffolding link, example, active tie-in.


  Output ONLY a JSON array: [{''type'': ''Basic Q&A|MCQ|Cloze'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''blooms_level'':
  ''REMEMBER|etc'', ''layer'': ''1|2|3|4''}]

  Ensure engaging, accurate, no fluff.'
