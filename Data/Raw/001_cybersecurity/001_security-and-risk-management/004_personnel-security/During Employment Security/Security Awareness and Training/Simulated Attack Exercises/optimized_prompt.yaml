active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the balance between realism in simulated attack exercises (e.g., cyber wargaming) and ethical
    considerations like employee stress. How can exercises align with NIST SP 800-84 while addressing misconceptions that
    simulations are 'just games'? Consider links to prior knowledge like phishing simulations and incident response fundamentals.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on
  ''Simulated Attack Exercises'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Personnel Security > During
  Employment Security > Security Awareness and Training > Simulated Attack Exercises). Cover all learning objectives, active
  learning activities, and 4 scaffolding layers provided below. Ensure pedagogical alignment: Bloom''s progression, active
  recall, spaced repetition best practices. Use research context: NIST SP 800-84 (Guide to TT&E Programs), cyber wargaming
  (MITRE), incident response (SP 800-61r3), ISO 27001 Annex A.7.2.2, CSF 2.0. Link to prior knowledge (phishing/tabletop/incident
  response). Big picture: Enhances personnel security and resilience.
