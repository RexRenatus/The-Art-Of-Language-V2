active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of insider threat mitigation, evaluate the trade-offs of aggressive DLP policies (e.g.,
    blocking USB usage) versus usability, using NIST SP 800-53 controls (e.g., AC-4, AU-2, SC-8) as a framework. Debate with
    examples from real breaches like the Capital One incident where insider access led to data exfiltration via cloud misconfigurations.
  peer_teaching: Students pair up; one explains DLP integration points (data at rest/motion/use) and how it ties to personnel
    security (e.g., monitoring employee emails for PII). The partner summarizes, quizzes with examples/non-examples of sensitive
    data (PII vs. public info), and provides feedback. Switch roles after 5 minutes.
  problem_solving: 'Real-world scenario: A mid-sized firm with remote workers handling PHI faces insider risks like data uploads
    to personal clouds. In small groups, design a DLP integration plan including: data inventory assessment, tools (e.g.,
    endpoint DLP sensors), workflows, NIST controls (AC, AU, SC), testing protocols, and mitigations. Present and critique
    peer plans.'

  **Pedagogy Integration:** Use Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives: [insert learning_objectives array]. Scaffolding: [insert scaffolding_layers
  object]. Prior knowledge: Link to data classification, AC, insider basics.


  **Active Learning Context:** Flashcards support discussion [discussion_prompt], peer teaching [peer_teaching], problem-solving
  [problem_solving]. Include scenario Qs for role-play (e.g., insider vs. admin).


  **Generate Flashcards:** Create 40-50 MCQs per [flashcard_schema]. Ensure active recall, spaced repetition friendly (concise
  fronts, detailed backs). Balance: 25% foundation, 25% components, 25% implementation, 25% integration. 30% insider threat
  scenarios (email PII, USB, cloud). Output as numbered list in exact schema format. End with summary stats (e.g., ''10 Layer1,
  8 Apply-level'').
