      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Procedure version control supports least privilege because it mandates that only authorized individuals can modify or approve changes, thereby limiting access to the management of procedures to those with a legitimate need. This prevents unauthorized personnel from altering critical security documentation, ensuring that access rights are appropriately restricted.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors misapply least privilege to automation, procedural complexity, or encryption, failing to recognize its core application to access control for managing procedural documentation.",
        "analogy": "Applying least privilege to procedure version control is like giving keys to a library only to librarians and researchers for specific sections, not to every visitor, ensuring only authorized individuals can manage or alter the valuable information."
