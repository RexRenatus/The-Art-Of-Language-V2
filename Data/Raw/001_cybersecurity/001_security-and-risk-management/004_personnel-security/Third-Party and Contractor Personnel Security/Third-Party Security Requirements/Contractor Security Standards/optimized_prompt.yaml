active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the potential impacts of a contractor data breach involving CUI (e.g.,
    financial loss, regulatory fines, reputational damage). How do standards like NIST SP 800-171 mitigate these risks? Support
    your arguments with specific control families and real-world examples from sources like the SolarWinds supply chain attack.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

      options:
      - A) Access Control (AC)
      - B) **Supply Chain Risk Management (SR)**
      - C) Incident Response (IR)
      - D) Media Protection (MP)
