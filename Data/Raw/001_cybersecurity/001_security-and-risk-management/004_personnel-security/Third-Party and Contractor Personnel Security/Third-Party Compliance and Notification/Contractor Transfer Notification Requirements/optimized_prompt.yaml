active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Analyze a scenario where a contractor is transferred from a low-access to a high-access role handling
    CUI. Debate the risks of delayed notification to the ISSM and CO, referencing NIST SP 800-53 PS-5, and propose optimal
    timelines (e.g., within 24-72 hours) to mitigate insider threats. Challenge common misconceptions like notifications being
    purely administrative.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains the differences between Contractor Transfer processes, notification requirements,
    and roles of ISSM/ISSO vs. CO/COR to their partner, using hand-drawn diagrams of access control flows. The partner then
    teaches back using an example involving FCI/CUI handling and potential access adjustments.
  problem_solving: 'Present a real-world scenario: A DoD contractor is internally reassigned from software testing (low access)
    to system administration (high access handling CUI). Identify required notifications (to ISSM, CO, COR), timelines per
    NIST SP 800-53 PS-5, steps to modify access privileges (e.g., revoke old, provision new per AC-2), and conduct what-if
    analysis for non-compliance leading to a data breach.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Personnel Security under
  NIST frameworks. Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (20 basic Q/A, 15 cloze, 15 MCQ) on ''Contractor Transfer Notification

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: Use concepts from [discussion_prompt], [peer_teaching], [problem_solving] for scenario-based cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [paste scaffolding_layers]. Tag each with layer and Bloom level.

  - Prior Knowledge: Link to AC-2, screening/onboarding.

  - Full Research Context: Core: Contractor Transfer (role/duty/access change); Notify ISSM/ISSO/CO/COR re NIST SP 800-53
  Rev5 PS-5 (notify within org-defined time, e.g., 24-72hrs; adjust access). NIST SP 800-171 Rev2 (PS mapping for CUI/FCI).

  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly [paste flashcard_schema]. Output as JSON array of objects, one per card. Ensure variety,
  active recall, spaced repetition friendly. Prioritize measurable outcomes, misconceptions (e.g., transfers don''t need review).'
