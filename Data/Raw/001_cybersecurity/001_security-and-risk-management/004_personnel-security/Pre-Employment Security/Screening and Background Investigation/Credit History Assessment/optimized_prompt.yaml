active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of pre-employment screening for cybersecurity roles, should credit history be a mandatory
    factor? Debate the balance between organizational security risks (e.g., financial distress leading to insider threats
    like bribery or coercion) and employee privacy rights under FCRA. Provide evidence from real-world cases, such as financial
    coercion incidents in government or tech sectors.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truths (e.g., mix permissible/non-permissible purposes); 3) Edge cases (e.g., outdated FCRA rules); 4) Irrelevant
    but plausible terms (e.g., confuse FCRA with FMLA). Ensure 60% test REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 25% APPLY/ANALYZE, 15% EVALUATE/CREATE.'

  university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (objectives provided), active learning (discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving),
  4-layer scaffolding (provided), and concept map.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema: Each as JSON object with ''front'' (MC question/stem), ''back''
  {correct_answer, explanation, distractors[array with why_wrong], bloom_level, reference}. Balance: 40% Layer1/REMEMBER-UNDERSTAND,
  30% Layer2-3/APPLY-ANALYZE, 30% Layer4/EVALUATE-CREATE. Incorporate distractor protocol. Ensure cybersecurity context (insider
  threats from financial distress).
