active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a cybersecurity firm hiring for a role managing national critical infrastructure, should drug testing
    be mandatory? Debate privacy rights versus security risks, considering real-world breaches linked to impaired personnel
    (e.g., insider threats due to substance influence). Reference HHS Mandatory Guidelines and NIST SP 800-53.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Topic Hierarchy:** Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Personnel Security > Pre-Employment Security > Screening
  and Background Investigation > Drug Testing Requirements.


  **Research Context (Complete Synthesis):** Drug testing analyzes specimens (urine, oral fluid, hair) for illegal drugs/metabolites
  (DEA Schedule I/II). Key terms: Covered employee (sensitive cybersecurity roles risking national security); MRO (licensed
  physician verifies results, checks medical explanations); SAP (evaluates violations, recommends treatment). Standards: HHS
  Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs (89 FR 20228, Apr 12 2024; includes oral fluid/hair); DOT
  49 CFR Part 40 (procedures); NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 PS-3 (Personnel Screening, includes drug tests for risky positions). Procedures:
  Collection > Lab test > MRO review > SAP if positive. Cybersecurity links: Mitigates impaired judgment risks in critical
  infrastructure. Sources: HHS.gov (Mandatory Guidelines), Federal Register, NIST SP 800-53, DOT.gov/49CFR.


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Generate 30 flashcards progressing through 4 scaffolding layers (Layer 1: Foundation terms; Layer
  2: Components/standards; Layer 3: Implementation/procedures; Layer 4: Integration/cyber risks). Cover Bloom''s: 30% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND,
  40% APPLY/ANALYZE, 30% EVALUATE/CREATE. Embed active learning hooks (e.g., scenario questions).


  **Output Format:** JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''Question with A/B/C/D options'', ''back'': {''correct'': ''A'',
  ''explanation'': ''...'', ''blooms_level'': ''APPLY'', ''layer'': 3, ''source'': ''HHS Guidelines''}}]. Use schema: MCQs
  with distractor protocol (plausible misconceptions). Explanations: Rationale + debunk + cyber tie-in + recall prompt.
