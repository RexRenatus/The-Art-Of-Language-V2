active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the risks of overlooking specific KSAs (e.g., ethical decision-making or
    threat intelligence analysis) in screening criteria for cybersecurity roles. Reference real-world examples like the SolarWinds
    breach and propose mitigations using NICE Framework competencies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Common error (e.g., swap NICE Work Role with NIST function); 3) Extreme/overgeneralized (e.g., ''All candidates need
    PhD''). Ensure plausibility from research context/misconceptions.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, aligned with university pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Candidate Screening
  Criteria Development'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Personnel Security > Pre-Employment Security
  > Screening and Background Investigation > Candidate Screening Criteria Development).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert full scaffolding above]

  - Active Learning Ties: Reference discussions, peer reviews, design challenges in explanations.

  - Key Content: NICE Framework (defines 52+ Work Roles, 8 Competency Areas clustering KSAs/task statements for screening);
  KSAs; NIST CSF 2.0 (Govern function for roles); RMF (risk roles); Personnel security best practices.
