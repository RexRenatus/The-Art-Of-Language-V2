  **Topic Context (Completed Research Summary):**

  In cybersecurity, Conflict of Interest (COI) occurs when personal interests (financial/professional) improperly influence
  judgment, compromising security. Disclosure ensures transparency for mitigation. Standards: NIST CSF 2.0 (Governance: ethical
  policies); NIST SP 800-53 Rev5 (PS-3: screening for impartiality); ISO/IEC 27001:2022 (A.7.2.3: ethics compliance); CISSP
  Code of Ethics (Rule 1.4: disclose potential COIs); CIS Controls v8 (Safeguard 1: personnel vetting). Best practices: Disclose
  actual/potential COIs in pre-employment contracts; mitigate via recusal/divestment/oversight. Examples: Vendor shares, family
  employment. Sources: [NIST CSF](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), [SP 800-53](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final),
  [ISO 27001](https://www.iso.org/standard/82875.html), [CISSP Ethics](https://www.isc2.org/ethics).


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the 6 objectives from above].

  - Scaffolding: Generate cards progressively across 4 layers [Insert scaffolding details].

  - Active Learning Tie-Ins: Incorporate elements like debate scenarios or peer-teach examples in explanations.

  - Assessments: Include MCQs with distractors per protocol.


  **Output Format:** JSON array of flashcards, each: {"front": "...", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "bloom_level":
  "...", "layer": 1, "source": "NIST SP 800-53"}}. Follow schema exactly: 40-50 cards, balanced, active recall optimized for
  spaced repetition. Ensure measurable, specific to hierarchy.'
