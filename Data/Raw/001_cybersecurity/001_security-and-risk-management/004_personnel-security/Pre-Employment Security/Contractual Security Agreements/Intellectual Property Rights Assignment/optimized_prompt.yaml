active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the potential cybersecurity risks to an organization if IP Rights Assignment
    clauses are omitted from pre-employment contracts. Consider scenarios involving employee-developed threat detection algorithms
    and CUI. Support your arguments with examples from NIST SP 800-53 Personnel Security controls and real-world breaches
    (e.g., trade secret theft cases).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    CUI vs. Classified Info). Ensure one distractor is highly tempting (near-miss). Mark correct answer clearly.'

  Incorporate this Research Context:

  - IP: Creations like software/algorithms. IPR: Legal protections. IP Assignment: Ownership transfer. Trade Secrets: Secret
  info (e.g., threat intel). Copyrights: Original works. Patents: Inventions. CUI: Controlled Unclassified Information (unclassified
  info requiring protection per laws/regulations like Executive Order 13556, DFARS 252.204-7012; in contracts, mandates marking,
  handling, limits on assignment).

  - Sources: NIST SP 800-53 (PS controls), USPTO.gov/ip-policy, DFARS clauses, CUI Program (nvlpubs.nist.gov).


  Use these Learning Objectives [insert array above], Active Learning [insert details], Scaffolding Layers [insert details],
  and Flashcard Schema [insert schema].


  Prerequisites: NDAs, basic contract law. Emphasize examples, misconceptions, concept map.


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards spanning Bloom''s levels (8-10 per level), covering all scaffolding layers. Prioritize
  active recall, spaced repetition best practices. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects matching the schema exactly.
