active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: What are the top 5 risks if an Asset Return Verification Checklist is skipped during offboarding? Debate
    using CIS Control 1 principles versus a real-world breach example like the 2023 MOVEit incident where insider assets were
    mishandled, sparking critical thinking on insider threats.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Physical return = secure' ignoring data wipe)
    - One distractor from related but incorrect framework (e.g., CIS Control 2 instead of 1)
    - One from real-world breach oversight (e.g., MOVEit-style insider asset mishandling)
    - One overly simplistic or incomplete (e.g., skipping unauthorized asset check)
    - 'Vary difficulty: 1 easy (obvious wrong), 2 medium (confusable terms)'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Asset Return Verification
  Checklist'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Personnel Security > Personnel Termination
  and Offboarding > Asset Recovery > Asset Return Verification Checklist). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives

  [insert scaffolding here].


  Sources: CIS Controls v8 (Control 1: Inventory/Control of Enterprise Assets), NIST CSF (ID.AM-1: Assets inventoried; PR.AC-1:
  Identities managed; DE.AE: Anomalies detected), NIST SP 800-53 (PS-4: Termination procedures), real-world: 2023 MOVEit breach.
  Sample Checklist: 1. Inventory match; 2. Physical inspect; 3. Data sanitize verify; 4. Unauthorized assets check; 5. Access
  revoke; 6. Inventory update; 7. Sign-off; 8. Audit; 9. Badge return; 10. Scan.


  Generate flashcards per schema [insert flashcard_schema here]. Output as JSON array: [{''question'': ''...'', ''options'':

  NIST completion, checklist details, concept map: Central ''Checklist'' → ''CIS1 Inventory'' → ''Data Wipe'' → ''Risks'').
  High-quality, engaging, misconception-busting.'
