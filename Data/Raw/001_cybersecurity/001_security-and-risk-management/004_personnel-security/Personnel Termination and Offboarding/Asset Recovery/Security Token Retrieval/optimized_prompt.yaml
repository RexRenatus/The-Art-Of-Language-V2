active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between immediate security token revocation versus graceful offboarding in a high-risk
    personnel termination scenario (e.g., suspected insider threat). Reference NIST SP 800-53 PS-4 guidelines on personnel
    termination and revocation procedures. How would you handle federated identities across multiple relying parties (RPs),
    and what role does NIST SP 800-63C play in token lifecycle management?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    confuse ''revocation'' with ''deletion''; mix physical/digital procedures; cite wrong NIST pubs like SP 800-63 issuance
    vs. 800-53 termination). Source from voter-noted errors (e.g., token issuance vs. recovery) and real-world pitfalls (e.g.,
    ignoring session persistence). Label correct answer clearly.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Personnel Security and
  Asset Recovery. Topic: ''Security Token Retrieval'' (Level 6 in hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management
  > Personnel Security > Personnel Termination and Offboarding > Asset Recovery > Security Token Retrieval). Focus exclusively
  on retrieval/revocation/recovery of physical (key fobs, smart cards) and digital (SSO tokens, API keys, certificates) security
  tokens during employee offboarding to prevent unauthorized access, per NIST SP 800-53 PS-4 (Personnel Termination) and AC-2
  (Account Management). Avoid general token issuance; emphasize risks, procedures, and compliance.


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]. Cover all Bloom''s levels proportionally.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers: [insert full descriptions].

  - Active Learning: Infuse prompts referencing discussion (trade-offs in revocation), peer teaching (analogies), problem-solving
  (scenarios with OAuth/hardware).

  - Link to priors: Assume knowledge of onboarding authentication (MFA, passwords).


  Generate flashcards per schema:

  [insert full flashcard_schema above].


  Output ONLY in JSON array: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...''}]. Ensure
  accuracy, no fabrication—ground in NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5, SP 800-63C (if federation), best practices. High spaced repetition
  value: concise fronts, detailed backs.'
