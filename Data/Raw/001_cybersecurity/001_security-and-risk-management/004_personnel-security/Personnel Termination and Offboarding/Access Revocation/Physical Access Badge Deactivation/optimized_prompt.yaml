active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains badge deactivation processes (temporary vs. permanent) using PIV card and
    FASC-N examples from FIPS 201-2; the partner summarizes key steps, quizzes with scenarios, and provides feedback on accuracy.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario of a terminated contractor with a lost badge over the weekend, design a step-by-step revocation
    checklist aligned with NIST SP 800-116 guidelines, including validation checks, logging, and notifications to security
    teams.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions: 1) Timing errors (e.g., ''delay
    24 hours'' vs. immediate), 2) Standard mix-ups (e.g., ''FIPS 199'' vs. ''FIPS 201-2''), 3) Scope confusion (e.g., logical
    vs. physical access). Ensure distractors are realistic from research context (e.g., outdated NIST versions, contractor
    vs. employee differences).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Personnel Security. Topic:
  Physical Access Badge Deactivation (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Personnel Security > Personnel
  Termination and Offboarding > Access Revocation > Physical Access Badge Deactivation). Use this research context: PACS (electronic
  access control), Badge Deactivation (revoke/disable, temp/perm), PIV Card/FASC-N (FIPS 201-2), Credential Validation. NIST
  SP 800-116 Rev. 1 (2018): Risk-based PIV use in PACS, revocation emphasis. Sources: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-116r1.pdf,

  Incorporate university pedagogy: Learning objectives [insert the 6 objectives above]. Active learning [insert the 3 activities].
  Scaffolding [insert the 4 layers]. Ensure prior knowledge links (access control basics), concept map (textual: Badge Deactivation
  → PACS/NIST → Termination → Logical Access), related concepts (account revocation, background checks), real-world cases
  (insider threats).


  Generate 30-50 flashcards per the schema: [insert full schema above]. Cover all scaffolding layers, Bloom''s levels, objectives.
  Vary types: 40% MCQ (with distractors), 30% Q&A process, 20% definitions, 10% create/evaluate scenarios. Output as JSON
