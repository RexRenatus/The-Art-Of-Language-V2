active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: During an employee's role change from junior developer to team lead, discuss the potential security risks
    of transitional access periods and debate strategies to balance operational continuity with privilege minimization, referencing
    NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Distractors: Plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., ''Abrupt revocation is always best'' vs. ''Phased with
      monitoring'').'
    - 'Source-grounded: Draw from research context (e.g., confuse PS-4 termination with PS-2 screening).'
    - 'Difficulty progression: Easy (Layer 1 facts), Medium (Layer 2/3 analysis), Hard (Layer 4 evaluation).'
    - 'Avoid: Obvious wrongs; ensure 60% plausibility.'
