    Ensure one correct, others plausible but wrong per standards.'

  ## Completed Research Context

  Core Concepts: HR coordinates workforce security in cybersecurity risk management, focusing on notifications for disciplinary
  actions/sanctions (e.g., policy violations like data leaks). Key: Joint security-HR processes for legal compliance, access
  revocation (NIST SP 800-53 PS-4), insider threat handling.

  Standards: NIST CSF 2.0 Govern (GV.OC Organizational Context, GV.RR Roles/Responsibilities); NIST SP 800-53 PS-4 Personnel
  Termination, PS-6 Access Agreements, IR-4 Incident Handling; HITRUST CSF v11 Domain 01 - 01.ab Personnel Security Policy,
  01.ac Management Commitment (HR involvement in terminations, notifications).

  Best Practices: Step-by-step coordination; metrics like notification timelines; case studies (Uber 2016 breach: HR-terminated
  employee post-incident concealment).

  Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (nist.gov/cyberframework); NIST SP 800-53 r5 (csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5); HITRUST CSF (hitrustalliance.net);
  SANS Insider Threat (sans.org).
