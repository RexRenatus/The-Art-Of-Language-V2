active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what situations during a cybersecurity policy violation (e.g., unauthorized data access or phishing
    susceptibility) should a verbal warning be issued to personnel instead of a formal written notice? Debate the pros and
    cons using NIST SP 800-53 PS-6 (Access Agreements) and SP 800-61 incident handling phases, considering factors like immediacy,
    documentation, and legal risks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Distractors must be plausible but incorrect:

    - Based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse verbal warnings with incident alerts; overlook documentation; mix with
    HR general practices vs. cybersecurity-specific).

    - Draw from research context (e.g., NIST incident phases as distractors for disciplinary steps).

    - Ensure 1 highly plausible (e.g., ''requires written log immediately'' vs. ''verbal but documented later'').

    - Vary difficulty: easy (obvious wrong), medium (partial truth), hard (contextual trap).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Personnel Security under
  NIST frameworks. Topic: **Verbal Warning Procedures** (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Personnel
  Security > Disciplinary Actions and Sanctions > Enforcement and Remediation > Verbal Warning Procedures). Focus exclusively
  on verbal warnings as initial disciplinary sanctions for cybersecurity policy violations (e.g., phishing, unauthorized access),
  NOT general incident alerts—align with NIST 800-53 PS controls and shift from IR communications per voter consensus.


  **Incorporate these pedagogical elements:**

  - Learning Objectives: {insert learning_objectives array here}

  - Active Learning: Use discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving to inspire application-based cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers: {insert scaffolding object here}. Ensure progression from Layer 1
  foundation to Layer 4 integration.


  **Generate 40-60 high-quality flashcards** following this exact schema: {insert flashcard_schema here}.


  **Best Practices (complete per voters):** Step-by-step: Assess → Meet privately → State facts/policy/consequences → Acknowledge
  → Document → Follow-up/escalate. Include templates, distinguish from written sanctions, add HR/legal notes, scenarios (e.g.,
  employee phishing error).


  **Output Format:** JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''tags'': [''...'']}, ...]. Ensure accuracy,
  engagement, and Bloom''s progression. No generic content—tailor to cybersecurity personnel discipline.'
