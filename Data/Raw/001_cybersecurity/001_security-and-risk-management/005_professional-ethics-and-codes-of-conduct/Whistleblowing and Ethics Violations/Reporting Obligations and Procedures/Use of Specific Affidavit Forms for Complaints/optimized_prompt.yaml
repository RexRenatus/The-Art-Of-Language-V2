active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a cybersecurity ethics violation involving a data breach cover-up or falsified risk reports, under
    what circumstances should an employee use an SEC Form TCR versus internal reporting channels or DOJ forms? Debate the
    pros/cons considering professional ethics codes, legal obligations (e.g., SOX, Dodd-Frank), and whistleblower protections.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    consumer form); 2) Partial truth (e.g., correct agency but wrong form); 3) Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., ''always
    use internal channels first''). Ensure distractors test nuance in professional vs. consumer contexts, ethics obligations.'
