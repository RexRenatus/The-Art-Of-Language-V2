active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical trade-offs of anonymous vs. identified reporting to cybersecurity
    ethics committees (e.g., (ISC)² or ISACA). Consider impacts on investigation thoroughness, whistleblower safety, and organizational
    trust. Support arguments with real-world examples like insider threat cover-ups.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Plausible but incorrect: Draw from outdated/irrelevant info (e.g., medical REC protocol submission instead of complaint
      filing).'
    - 'Common errors: Mix up organizations (e.g., ISACA step as (ISC)²), omit evidence/timeline.'
    - 'Edge cases: Partial truths (e.g., ''Email CEO'' instead of official portal).'
    - 'Balance: 1 highly plausible, 1 superficial, 1 unrelated.'
