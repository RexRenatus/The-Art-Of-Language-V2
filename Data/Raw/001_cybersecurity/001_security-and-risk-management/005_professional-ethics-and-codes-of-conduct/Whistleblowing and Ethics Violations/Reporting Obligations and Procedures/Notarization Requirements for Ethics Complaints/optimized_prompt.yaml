active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the pros and cons of requiring notarization for ethics complaints versus using digital signatures
    or affidavits in cybersecurity ethics reporting. Consider factors like accessibility, legal weight, and deterrence of
    frivolous claims.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (50% of cards): 4 options (1 correct). Distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g.,
    ''All ethics complaints require notarization'' vs. ''ISACA does not explicitly require it''); partial truths (e.g., ''Required
    for (ISC)²'' if inaccurate); plausible alternatives (e.g., ''Digital signature only'' vs. ''Notary or affidavit''). Ensure
    distractors teach by debunking.'

  Key facts: Ethics complaints are formal allegations of misconduct; notarization verifies signer identity but is NOT explicitly
  required by ISACA (focus on factual info/evidence); NIST is technical-focused; compare with (ISC)²/CISSP (similarly no universal
  mandate). Best practices: Objectivity, due diligence, evidence submission, anonymity options, timelines (e.g., submit promptly).
  Sources: ISACA Code [https://isaca.org/code-of-professional-ethics]; expand with (ISC)² ethics page.


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Use Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives: [insert learning_objectives array here]. Scaffolding: Build
  from Layer 1 (definitions) to Layer 4 (integration). Include active learning hooks: discussion debates, peer teaching, problem-solving
  scenarios.


  **Generate Flashcards:** Create 25 flashcards following the exact schema: [insert flashcard_schema details here]. Ensure
  university-style: measurable, active, misconception-busting. Link to prior knowledge (e.g., ethics codes). Output ONLY as
  JSON array: [{''front'': ''Question text'', ''back'': ''Answer + explanation + tags'', ''bloom_level'': ''Remember'', ''type'':
  ''MCQ/Cloze''}]. No extra text.'
