active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one partner explains a key regulation (e.g., 28 CFR §0.29f or NIST governance principles) to the
    other, then switches. Follow with a teach-back using a real-world example, such as an anonymous report of a data breach
    cover-up in a corporate insider threat program.
  problem_solving: 'Given a scenario: An anonymous complainant reports a data breach cover-up via CISA''s whistleblower channel.
    Create a decision flowchart for whether to disclose the complainant''s name to the respondent, considering retaliation
    risks, consent, and regulations like 42 CFR protections.'

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Partial truth (e.g., mentions consent but ignores ''unavoidable''
    exception), 2) Opposite/extreme (e.g., ''Always disclose for due process''), 3) Unrelated/misconception (e.g., confuses
    with public disclosure laws). Ensure distractors are plausible based on common errors in ethics training.'

  Incorporate:

  - Bloom''s progression: Mix objectives from Remember to Create.

  - Scaffolding: Tag each card to a layer.

  - Active Learning: Link cards to discussion/peer/problem-solving where relevant.

  - Prerequisites: Builds on whistleblowing basics.


  Follow this exact schema for 25 flashcards: Output as a JSON array of objects matching {''id'':1-25, ''type'':''mcq''|''cloze'',

  Use distractor protocol: 3 plausible distractors (partial truth, opposite, misconception). Ensure active learning (e.g.,
  scenario-based Qs), web-grounded accuracy, and voter priorities (completeness, pedagogy).'
