active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the importance of impartiality in cybersecurity ethics enforcement. How
    does the GIAC Ethics Council's structure (independent members, structured appeals) prevent bias? Connect to real-world
    examples of ethical violations in the industry and evaluate if GIAC's process adequately protects whistleblowers.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - 'Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., ''Immediate suspension'' instead of investigation).'
  - 'Distractor 2: Partial truth/opposite (e.g., ''Council investigates directly'' vs. assigned investigators).'
  - 'Distractor 3: Plausible but incorrect from other certs (e.g., ''Public shaming'' like some ISC² cases).'
  - Ensure distractors promote active recall and address voter-noted examples/misconceptions.
