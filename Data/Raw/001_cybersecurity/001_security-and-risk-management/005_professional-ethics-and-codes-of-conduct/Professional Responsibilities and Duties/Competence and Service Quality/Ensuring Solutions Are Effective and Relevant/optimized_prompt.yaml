  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the following: ''Was the SolarWinds supply chain attack preventable through
    better alignment of cybersecurity solutions with NIST CSF 2.0''s Identify (ID) and Govern (GV) functions? Provide evidence
    from ERM and SCRM perspectives, and link to ethical responsibilities for competence.'' Encourage participants to reference
    voter-suggested examples and critique each other''s arguments.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
