  **Research Context (Completed):** Due diligence in C-SCRM is systematic evaluation of suppliers'' security before/ongoing.
  Definitions: Due Diligence (investigative rigor), C-SCRM (risks: malicious/counterfeit/vulnerable), TPRM, ICT. Frameworks:
  NIST SP 800-161r1 (practices, tiers, FOCI), NIST SP 1326 (Quick-Start: 1. Define scope; 2. Gather info; 3. Assess risks
  incl. FOCI (Foreign Ownership, Control, Influence – e.g., foreign control risks), security practices, counterfeits; 4. Score/decide).
  Risks ex: SolarWinds. Sources: NIST SP 800-161r1 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-161r1), NIST SP 1326 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/1326),
  (ISC)² Code of Ethics.

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the scaffolding_layers array here verbatim].

  **Active Learning:** Use concepts from [Insert active_learning_components here] to inspire higher-order cards (e.g., debate
  ethics, teach-back FOCI, solve supplier eval).


  Generate 25-30 flashcards following the exact schema: [Insert flashcard_generation_schema verbatim]. Ensure progressive
  coverage: Layers 1-4, all Bloom''s levels. High-quality: precise NIST refs, no gaps, educational explanations tying to ethics/competence.
  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects.'
