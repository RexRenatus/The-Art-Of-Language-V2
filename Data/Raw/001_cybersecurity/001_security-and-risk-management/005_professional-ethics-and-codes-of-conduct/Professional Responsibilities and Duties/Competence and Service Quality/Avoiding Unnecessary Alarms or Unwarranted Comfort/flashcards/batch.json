        "core_logic": "Unwarranted comfort poses a primary risk because it fosters a dangerous complacency, leading organizations to believe their current security measures are adequate, thereby neglecting to update or implement necessary controls against evolving threats and increasing the likelihood of a breach.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors describe outcomes that are either the opposite of unwarranted comfort (over-investment, complex measures) or are secondary consequences (decreased audits), failing to identify the core risk of complacency and underestimation of threats.",
        "analogy": "It's like a homeowner who feels 'unwarranted comfort' because their alarm system is installed, and therefore stops checking if the sensors are working or if the monitoring company is still active, leaving them vulnerable if an actual intrusion occurs."
