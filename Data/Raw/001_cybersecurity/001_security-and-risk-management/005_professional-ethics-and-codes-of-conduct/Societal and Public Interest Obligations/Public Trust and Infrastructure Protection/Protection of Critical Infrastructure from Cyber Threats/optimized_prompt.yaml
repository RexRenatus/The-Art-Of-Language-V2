active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, teach-back the six NIST CSF 2.0 functions using real-world critical infrastructure analogies (e.g.,
    power grid for PROTECT access controls, water treatment plant for RESPOND to ransomware).
  problem_solving: Simulate a ransomware attack on a water treatment plant; in teams, apply CSF RESPOND and RECOVER functions
    to develop an incident response plan, then evaluate ethical implications of disclosure to the public.

    (e.g., confuse DETECT with RESPOND functions); 3) Extreme/unrealistic (e.g., ignore governance for tech-only fixes); 4)
    Irrelevant detail (e.g., outdated CSF 1.1 without Govern). Ensure plausible for experts, test nuance.'

  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives** (Bloom''s Taxonomy): [Insert full learning_objectives array here]. Balance flashcards: 20% Remember/Understand,
  30% Apply/Analyze, 50% Evaluate/Create.

  - **Scaffolding Layers**: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers - [Insert full scaffolding object here]. Tag each card with
  layer.

  - **Active Learning Tie-Ins**: Infuse questions inspired by discussions (e.g., mandatory CSF), peer teaching (analogies),
  problem-solving (scenarios like ransomware on water plant).

  - **Research Context**: Use NIST CSF 2.0 (6 functions: Govern/Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover; Tiers 1-4; Profiles),
  CISA definitions, (ISC)² ethics, examples (Colonial Pipeline). Sources: NIST SP 800-53, CISA.gov, NIST CSF 2.0 doc.
