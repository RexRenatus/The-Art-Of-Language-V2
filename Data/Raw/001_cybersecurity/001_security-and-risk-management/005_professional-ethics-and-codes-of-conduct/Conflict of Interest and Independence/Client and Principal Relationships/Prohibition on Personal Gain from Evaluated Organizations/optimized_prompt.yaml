    on personal gain?'' Provide pros/cons with evidence from NIST SP 800-53, CMMC Federal Register (85 FR 30914), and (ISC)²
    Code of Ethics. Consider timing (pre- vs. post-assessment) and disclosure requirements.'

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Gifts under $50
    are okay'' – wrong, any personal gain prohibited). 2) Partial truths (e.g., ''Only pre-assessment gains banned'' – ignores
    post-assessment). 3) Real-world pitfalls (e.g., Enron-like ''revolving door'' jobs). 4) Edge cases from standards (e.g.,
    NIST vs. CMMC differences). Ensure one distractor is a ''superficially attractive'' reversal.'
