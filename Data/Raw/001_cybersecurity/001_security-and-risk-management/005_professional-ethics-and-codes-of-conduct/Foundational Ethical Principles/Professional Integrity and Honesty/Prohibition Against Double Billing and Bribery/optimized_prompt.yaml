active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a cybersecurity supply chain context, debate how bribery in vendor selection (e.g., overlooking weak
    security for kickbacks) creates amplified cyber risks. Support your position with OECD Convention principles and real-world
    examples like the SolarWinds breach influenced by poor vendor ethics.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    distractors: 1. Plausible but incorrect (e.g., common misconception like 'double billing is always unintentional'). 2.
      Related but off-topic (e.g., another NIST family like RA). 3. Extreme/overgeneralized (e.g., 'bribery only involves
      cash'). Ensure distractors teach via error analysis in explanations.
    coverage: 'Balance: 40% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND (defs), 30% APPLY/ANALYZE (scenarios), 30% EVALUATE/CREATE (policies/controls).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity ethics education. Generate 20 high-quality flashcards
  on ''Prohibition Against Double Billing and Bribery'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Professional
  Ethics and Codes of Conduct > Foundational Ethical Principles > Professional Integrity and Honesty > Prohibition Against
  Double Billing and Bribery).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [insert full list from above]

  - Active learning: Tie explanations to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [insert summaries].

  - Big picture: Ethics reduce financial risks amplifying cyber vulns.

  - Sources: NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final), OECD Convention (https://www.oecd.org/corruption/oecdantibriberyconvention.htm),
  ISO 37301.


  Use exact flashcard schema: JSON array of objects with ''front'', ''back'' {answer, explanation, references, scaffolding_layer,
  bloom_level}. Follow distractor protocol for MCQs. Ensure progressive complexity, real-world examples (supply chain bribery,
  MSSP double billing), and voter consensus (85.7% approval).


  Output only valid JSON array of 20 flashcards.'
