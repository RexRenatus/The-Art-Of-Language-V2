    Partial truth (e.g., related term from another canon); 3) Extreme/opposite (e.g., ''ignore unethical behavior'' vs. report).
    Base on topic content, voter priorities (e.g., incomplete best practices), and research (e.g., advancing vs. protecting).
    Ensure 60% MCQ, 40% basic/cloze for variety.'
