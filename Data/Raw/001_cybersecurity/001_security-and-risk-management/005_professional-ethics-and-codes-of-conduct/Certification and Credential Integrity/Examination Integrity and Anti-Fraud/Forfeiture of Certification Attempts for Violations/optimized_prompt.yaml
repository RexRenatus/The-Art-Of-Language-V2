active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the ethical implications of using online braindumps for cybersecurity certification prep (e.g.,
    CISSP). Argue for or against their use, citing specific policies from (ISC)² Code of Ethics or CompTIA Candidate Agreement,
    and discuss long-term career impacts.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors that: 1) Reflect voter-noted mismatches (e.g., NIST/CMMC organizational compliance
    vs. exam cheating), 2) Use similar terminology but wrong context (e.g., ''audit failure'' instead of ''braindump''), 3)
    Test nuance (e.g., ''warning'' vs. ''forfeiture''), 4) Ensure 1 best answer, plausible but incorrect others. Limit to
    20-30% factual errors from real policies.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² CISSP, CompTIA Security+,
  and EC-Council certifications. Topic: Forfeiture of Certification Attempts for Violations (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security
  And Risk Management > Professional Ethics and Codes of Conduct > Certification and Credential Integrity > Examination Integrity
  and Anti-Fraud). Focus exclusively on individual exam integrity (cheating, braindumps, proxy testing); exclude organizational
  compliance like CMMC/NIST audits.
