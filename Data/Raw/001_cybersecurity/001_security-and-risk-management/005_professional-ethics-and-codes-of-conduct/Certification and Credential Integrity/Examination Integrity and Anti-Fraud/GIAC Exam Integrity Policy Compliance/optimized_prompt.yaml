    is always OK''); (2) Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Only exact questions are prohibited''); (3) Extreme opposite

    materials. Ensure correct answer is unambiguous.'

  **Content Coverage (Complete Policy Summary):** Core Concepts: Exam Integrity (fair assessment without cheating); Exam Content
  (questions/scenarios/images); Intellectual Property (GIAC-owned, U.S. Copyright); Certification Attempt. Prohibitions: No
  Unauthorized Materials (no notes/devices/help); No Disclosure/Sharing (pre/post-exam, including brain-dumps, forums, social
  media); No Cheating/Aids. Violations/Consequences: Score invalidation, certification revocation, bans, legal action. Reporting:
  Contact integrity@giac.org. Aligns with ISO/IEC 17024 (certification competence) & NIST SP 800-16 (skills validation). Sources:

  **Pedagogy Integration:** Progress through Bloom''s (Remember/Understand: define/explain; Apply/Analyze: classify/compare;
  Evaluate/Create: assess/design). Scaffolding: Layer 1 Foundation (terms); Layer 2 Components (prohibitions/consequences);
  Layer 3 Implementation (scenarios); Layer 4 Integration (ethics/cases). Embed active learning: discussion on sharing, peer
  teaching examples/non-examples, problem-solving scenarios.


  **Objectives:** [Insert full learning_objectives array here].


  **Generate Flashcards:** 40-60 total, 10-15 per scaffolding layer. Follow flashcard_schema exactly. Output as JSON array:
  [{''layer'': ''1'', ''blooms_level'': ''Remember'', ''type'': ''Q&A'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...''}]. Ensure voter
  consensus: measurable objectives, complete content (violations/consequences/reporting/cases), misconception-addressing distractors.
  High-quality, exam-ready, engaging for university-level cybersecurity students.'
