  discussion_prompt: In a ransomware attack on a law firm where client confidential data may have been compromised, debate
    whether immediate client notification under ABA Rule 1.4 is always required, or if assessing the full scope first is ethically
    permissible. Use NYC Bar Formal Opinion 2024-3 to support arguments, considering risks to confidentiality (Rule 1.6) and
    competence (Rule 1.1).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ cards (40% of total): Create 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g.,
    for Rule 1.4 notification: distractors like ''Always notify immediately without assessment'', ''Never notify to preserve
    confidentiality'', ''Notify only regulators''). Distractors should be rule-adjacent (e.g., mix Rules 1.4 and 1.6) or from
    real opinions (NYC Bar 2024-3 edge cases). Ensure one is a frequent ethical pitfall.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in university-level pedagogy for Cybersecurity topics.
  Generate 50-100 high-quality flashcards on ''Attorneys'' Ethical Duty in Client Data Protection Post-Incident'' (Topic Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Professional Ethics and Codes of Conduct > Confidentiality and Data Protection
  > Data Breach and Incident Response Ethics > Attorneys'' Ethical Duty in Client Data Protection Post-Incident).


  Incorporate these EXACT elements:

  - **Learning Objectives** (span Bloom''s): [insert full array from ''learning_objectives''].

  - **Active Learning**: Tie cards to discussion (ransomware notification debate), peer teaching (rule explanations), problem-solving
  (breach response plan).

  - **Scaffolding** (4 layers): Distribute cards evenly – 25% Layer 1 (Foundation: terms like cybersecurity incident, data
  breach; prerequisites ABA 1.1/1.4/1.6), 25% Layer 2 (Components: full ABA Rules 1.1 Competence, 1.4 Communication, 1.6 Confidentiality,
  1.15 Safekeeping Property, 5.1-5.3 Supervision; NYC Bar 2024-3 quotes), 25% Layer 3 (Implementation: post-incident steps),
  25% Layer 4 (Integration: critiques, designs). Label each card with layer.

  - **Content Completeness**: Use research context – definitions (cybersecurity incident, confidential info, data breach),
  sources (NYC Bar Opinion 2024-3: obligations post-incident; MichBar; ABA Rules full summaries/applications).


  **Output Format**: JSON array of objects: [{''id'': 1, ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''1'', ''tags'': [''...'']}, ''type'': ''MCQ/cloze/short''}]. Strictly follow
  flashcard_schema: 40% MCQ with 3 distractors, explanations with citations/quotes/misconception corrections/active ties.


  Ensure progressive difficulty (foundation to create), spaced repetition optimization (active recall), and ethical accuracy.
  No fabrication – ground in provided rules/opinions.'
