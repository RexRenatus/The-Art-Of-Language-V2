  **Topic Hierarchy**: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Professional Ethics and Codes of Conduct > Confidentiality
  and Data Protection > Intellectual Property Protection > Prohibition Against Use of Unethically Obtained Processes.


  **Completed Research Context** (voter consensus: integrate completeness):

  - Unethically obtained processes: Maliciously tainted (intentional compromise), counterfeit (imitations), IP theft/espionage,
  sanctions/FOCI violations.

  - NIST SP 800-161r1 (C-SCRM): Acquisition strategies - Develop plans with security reqs in RFPs/contracts; evaluate suppliers
  (risk assessments, audits, diversification); lifecycle monitoring (disposition, patching).

  - Ethical/legal ties: (ISC)² Code, transparency, harm avoidance.

  - Sources: NIST SP 800-161r1 (Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management), NIST SP 800-53 Rev5 (Supply Chain Controls),
  NIST IR 8276 (C-SCRM Practices), ISO/IEC 27036 (Supplier Relationships), ISO 27001 Annex A.15.


  **Pedagogy Integration** (Bloom''s progression, 4-layer scaffolding, prior knowledge links to ethics/supply chain/IP):

  Use provided learning_objectives, active_learning activities, and scaffolding_layers exactly.


  **Generate Flashcards** per flashcard_schema:

  - 40-50 total, balanced (10/layer, span Bloom''s).

  - Voter priorities: Full NIST acquisition details, engagement ties, knowledge integration.

  - Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''blooms_level'':
  ''...'', ''layer'': 1, ''activity_tie'': ''...''}}, ...]

  Ensure high-quality, university-level: active recall, spaced repetition optimized, distractors promote analysis.'
