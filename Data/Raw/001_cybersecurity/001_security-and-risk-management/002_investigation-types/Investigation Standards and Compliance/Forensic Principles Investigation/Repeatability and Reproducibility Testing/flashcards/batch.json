        "core_logic": "A 'known-good' baseline establishes the expected state of a system or data, serving as a consistent reference. This is fundamental for repeatability and reproducibility because it allows for objective comparison, enabling analysts to reliably identify anomalies or malicious artifacts, because it provides a stable point of reference.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors misrepresent the baseline's purpose by linking it to tool compatibility, efficiency shortcuts, or report simplification, rather than its core function of providing a consistent, objective reference for comparative analysis.",
        "analogy": "A 'known-good' baseline is like having a master key. You use it to compare against any other key to see if it's the correct one or if it's been altered."
