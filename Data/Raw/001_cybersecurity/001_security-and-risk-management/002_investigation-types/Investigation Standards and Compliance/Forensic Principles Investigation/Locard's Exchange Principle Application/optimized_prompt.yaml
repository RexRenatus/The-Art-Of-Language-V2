  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the following: ''Does Locard''s Exchange Principle hold true for advanced persistent threats
    (APTs) that use living-off-the-land techniques? Provide examples of trace evidence in APT vs. script kiddie attacks, and
    discuss limitations or misconceptions.'' Encourage critical thinking by requiring evidence from NIST guidelines or real-world
    cases like SolarWinds.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Confusable concepts (e.g., logs vs. network artifacts), (3) Partial truths (e.g., ''Memory is most persistent'' – wrong,
    it''s volatile), (4) Real-world edge cases (e.g., anti-forensic tools). Ensure plausibility for higher Bloom''s levels.'
