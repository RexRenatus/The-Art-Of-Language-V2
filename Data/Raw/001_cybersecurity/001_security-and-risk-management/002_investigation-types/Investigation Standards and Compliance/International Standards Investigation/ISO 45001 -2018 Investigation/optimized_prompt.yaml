active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges of implementing timely incident investigations in high-risk
    industries (e.g., construction). How does ISO 45001:2018 Clause 10.2 address these, and what improvements would you propose?
    Support with examples from real-world OH&S incidents.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
