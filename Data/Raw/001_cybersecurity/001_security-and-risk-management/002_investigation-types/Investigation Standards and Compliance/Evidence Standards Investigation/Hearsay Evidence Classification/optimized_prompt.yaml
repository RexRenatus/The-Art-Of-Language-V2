active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a cybersecurity breach investigation, a witness provides a screenshot of a phishing email they received,
    claiming it matches the attacker's method. Debate whether this constitutes hearsay, potential exceptions (e.g., FRE 803(6)
    if treated as a business record), and its impact on trial outcomes. Support with FRE references and real-world cyber cases.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security and Risk Management\
  \ > Investigation Types > Investigation Standards and Compliance > Evidence Standards Investigation > Hearsay Evidence Classification.\n\
  \nGenerate 30 high-quality flashcards (15 basic, 15 MCQ) covering the topic, optimized for university-level pedagogy using\
  \ Bloom's Taxonomy, active learning, and scaffolding.\n\n**Context:** Hearsay is a legal concept from Federal Rules of Evidence\
  \ (FRE), bridged to cybersecurity via digital forensics: e.g., witness statements on hacks vs. authenticated logs. No direct\
  \ cyber research link, but apply to investigations (logs as business records FRE 803(6), chain of custody).\n\n**Incorporate:**\n\
  - Learning Objectives: [insert array above]\n- Scaffolding Layers: [insert layers above] (distribute cards: 8 Layer 1, 8\
  \ Layer 2, 7 Layer 3, 7 Layer 4)\n- Active Learning: Draw examples from [discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving above]\n\
  - Bloom's Coverage: Even distribution across levels.\n\n**Output Format:** JSON array of objects:\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": 1,\n\
  \    \"type\": \"basic|mcq\",\n    \"bloom_level\": \"REMEMBER|UNDERSTAND|etc.\",\n    \"scaffolding_layer\": 1-4,\n   \

  \ per protocol, engaging cyber examples. Vary difficulty."
