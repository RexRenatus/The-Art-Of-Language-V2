active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the potential consequences of skipping the Incident and Investigation Review
    phase in a real-world ransomware incident. How does this phase ensure defensibility in court? Support your arguments with
    examples from SANS best practices.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in SANS Investigation Methodology\
  \ (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Investigation Types > Investigation Standards and Compliance\
  \ > Framework-Based Investigation > SANS Investigation Methodology).\n\nUse the provided learning objectives, active learning\
  \ activities, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema to generate 50 high-quality flashcards.\n\n**Contextual Knowledge\
  \ (Full SANS DFIR Methodology - Completed per Voter Consensus):**\nLayer 1 Foundation: [Insert full Layer 1 text].\nLayer\
  \ 2 Components: [Insert full Layer 2 text].\nLayer 3 Implementation: [Insert full Layer 3 text].\nLayer 4 Integration: [Insert\
  \ full Layer 4 text].\nPrerequisite flow: Builds on incident response basics.\n\n**Pedagogy Integration:**\n- Align cards\
  \ to Bloom's objectives.\n- Embed active learning hooks (e.g., 'How would you discuss this in a peer teach?').\n- Scaffolding:\
  \ Progress from Layer 1 to 4.\n\n**Output Format (JSON Array):**\n[\n  {\n    \"front\": \"Question here\",\n    \"back\"\
