  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue for or against automatically suspending all auto-deletion policies company-wide
    upon receiving a litigation hold notice. Consider costs, risks, efficiency, legal obligations under FRCP 37(e), and Sedona
    Conference guidelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors from: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., preservation only for emails, not Slack
    chats), 2) Confusions with related concepts (e.g., standard retention vs. indefinite hold), 3) Partial truths (e.g., ''Triggered
    only by lawsuit filing'' ignoring ''anticipation of litigation''), 4) Edge cases (e.g., irrelevant data types). Ensure
    distractors are plausible to educated learners but incorrect per standards.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Litigation Hold Data Retention\
  \ (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Investigation Types > eDiscovery Investigation Types\
  \ > Legal Hold Investigation > Litigation Hold Data Retention).\n\nGenerate 50 high-quality flashcards using the provided\
  \ schema. Incorporate these pedagogical elements:\n\n**Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 'learning_objectives' array here\
  \ verbatim].\n\n**Active Learning Context:** Flashcards should support discussion (e.g., debate on auto-suspension), peer\
  \ teaching (layer-specific), and problem-solving (scenarios).\n\n**Scaffolding Layers & Prior Knowledge:** [Insert 'scaffolding'\
  \ object here verbatim]. Use this for content depth and progression.\n\n**Flashcard Schema:** Strictly follow the structure:\
  \ Front (question), Back (answer, explanation, distractors for MCQs, bloom_level, source). Balance across layers/Bloom's.\n\
  \n**Content Sources (Complete & Verified):** \n- Sedona Conference Commentary on Legal Holds (Principles 1-7: scope, notice,\
  \ preservation).\n- FRCP Rule 37(e): Failure to preserve ESI sanctions.\n- NIST SP 800-86: Guide to Integrating Forensic\
  \ Techniques into Incident Response.\n- NIST SP 800-88: Guidelines for Media Sanitization (release procedures).\n- Best\
  \ Practices: Custodian interviews, defensible deletion suspension, tools like Legal Hold Pro.\n- Cases: Chin v. Port Authority\
  \ (spoliation), Pension Comm. v. Banc of America.\n\nEnsure flashcards promote active recall, spaced repetition, and higher-order\
  \ thinking. Output as a numbered list of JSON objects, one per flashcard, e.g., {'front': '...', 'back': {'answer': '...',\
