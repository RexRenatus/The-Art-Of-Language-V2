active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the unique challenges of tablet device investigations (e.g., encryption,
    BYOD policies) compared to smartphones. How do NIST SP 800-46 and the Cybersecurity Framework address these? Support with
    evidence from real-world cases.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    correct for Android but wrong for iOS); 3) Related but incorrect (e.g., NIST CSF Protect instead of Respond); Ensure plausible
    for multiple-choice testing; Avoid obvious errors.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator synthesizing university-level educational content on ''Tablet Device
  Investigation'' (Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Investigation Types > Digital Forensics Investigation Types
  > Mobile Device Forensics > Tablet Device Investigation). Consensus-approved (100%) with voter priorities: completeness
  (NIST SP 800-46 full details, sources/links), pedagogy (Bloom''s objectives), scaffolding, knowledge integration.


  **Prior Knowledge:** Basic digital forensics, iOS/Android OS fundamentals, general cybersecurity investigations.


  **Completed Research Context:** Tablet forensics involves evidence from touchscreen devices (iOS/Android). NIST SP 800-46
  Rev. 2 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-46r2.pdf): Guides BYOD/telework security, risk
  mgmt for mobiles. NIST Cybersecurity Framework (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework): Respond/Detect for investigations.
  NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-30r1.pdf): Risk assessments.
  Tools: Cellebrite UFED (https://cellebrite.com/en/ufed/), Oxygen Forensics (https://www.oxygen-forensics.com/). Challenges:
  Encryption (FDE), app extraction, cloud data. Steps: Isolate, acquire (logical/physical), analyze, report w/ chain of custody.


  **Sources:** NIST SP 800-46r2, NIST CSF 2.0, SP 800-30r1, Cellebrite docs, Oxygen Forensic whitepapers, NISTIR 8367 Mobile
  Forensics.


  **Learning Objectives:** [insert array from above].


  **Active Learning Examples:** Use for context in explanations: [insert active_learning object].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [insert scaffolding array].


  **Related Concepts:** Smartphone/computer forensics, BYOD/COPE, NIST Respond/Detect.


  **Concept Map (Textual):** Tablet Device Investigation → Evidence Acquisition (logical/physical) → Tools (Cellebrite) →
  Challenges (encryption) → NIST SP 800-46/BYOD → Integration (Risk Mgmt).


  **Misconceptions:** Tablets=phones exactly; Ignore OS diffs; BYOD=personal only.


  Generate exactly 50 flashcards in JSON array format. Strictly follow flashcard_schema: each card must have question, answer,
  distractors[3], explanation, metadata (bloom_level, scaffolding_layer, related_concept, difficulty). Balance coverage: all
  objectives/layers/tools/challenges/NIST/BYOD. Questions active/recall-oriented. Distractors per protocol. Explanations pedagogical,
  cite sources. Output ONLY the JSON array, no extra text.'
