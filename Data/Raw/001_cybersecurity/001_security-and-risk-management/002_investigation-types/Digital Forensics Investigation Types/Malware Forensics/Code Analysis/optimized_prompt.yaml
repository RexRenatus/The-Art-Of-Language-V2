active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of static versus dynamic code analysis for malware reverse
    engineering. Consider scenarios where one fails (e.g., heavy obfuscation in static analysis) and propose hybrid approaches.
    Support with real-world examples like WannaCry ransomware analysis.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - 'Base on voter-noted misconceptions: e.g., ''SAST requires source code'' → Distractor: ''Static analysis only on human-readable
    source''; Reality: Binaries OK.'
  - 'Use partial truths: e.g., For dynamic: ''Simulates all real attacks'' → No, black-box limitations.'
  - 'Incorporate hierarchy errors: Confuse with DevSecOps (SCA/SBOM as development, not forensics).'
  - 'Vary difficulty: 1 easy (definition swap), 1 medium (tool mismatch), 1 hard (workflow step error).'
  - Ensure 60% cards at REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 25% APPLY/ANALYZE, 15% EVALUATE/CREATE.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Malware Forensics: Code
  Analysis (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Investigation Types > Digital Forensics Investigation
  Types > Malware Forensics > Code Analysis). Focus exclusively on malware reverse engineering (disassembly, decompilation,
  static/dynamic binary analysis with tools like Ghidra, IDA Pro, Radare2, BinDiff); avoid DevSecOps source-code SAST/DAST/SCA—map
  SAST to static binary analysis only.
