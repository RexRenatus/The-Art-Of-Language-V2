    reject non-compliant emails for security, or parse for evidence preservation? Use real cases like phishing emails with
    spoofed headers.'

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse folding with MIME),
    2) Obsolete syntax variant (e.g., old date format), 3) Security-related trap (e.g., spoofed header value). Ensure distractors
    are realistic from RFC822/RFC5322 diffs or forensics pitfalls. Mark correct option explicitly.'

  **Context:** Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Investigation Types > Digital Forensics Investigation
  Types > Email Forensics > RFC822 Parser Investigation. Big Picture: Critical for forensics to parse legacy emails, detect
  spoofing/injections in phishing/malware cases.


  **Learning Objectives:** [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]


  **Active Learning Integration:** Weave in hooks: e.g., cards prompting discussion on obsolete syntax risks, peer explanations
  of folding, or parsing exercises.


  **Scaffolding Content:** Strictly base cards on these 4 layers: [INSERT scaffolding_layers ARRAY HERE]. Ensure even coverage.


  **Output Schema:** [INSERT flashcard_schema.structure HERE]. Follow EXACTLY: JSON array only, no extra text.


  **Best Practices:** Use precise RFC822 syntax/examples (7-bit US-ASCII, ABNF tokens). Emphasize cybersecurity: spoofing,
  CRLF injection, legacy vulns. Distractors per protocol. Explanations scaffolded (link to higher layers). Make active: e.g.,
  ''Apply: Parse this phishing header...'''
