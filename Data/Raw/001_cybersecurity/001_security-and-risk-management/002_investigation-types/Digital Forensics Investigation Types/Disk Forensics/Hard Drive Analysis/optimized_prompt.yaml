  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full learning_objectives JSON here]

  - Prior Knowledge: [Insert prior_knowledge here]

  - Active Learning: Use to inspire scenario-based cards (e.g., discussion debates as eval questions).

  - Scaffolding Layers: Distribute flashcards evenly (10 per layer); tag each with layer.

  - Concept Map: Central ''Hard Drive Analysis'' → branches: Forensic Techniques (imaging/dd/FTK, carving, slack/timeline),
  Sanitization (NIST 800-88: Clear/Purge/Destroy), Encryption (NIST 800-111), Chain of Custody, Incident Response (NIST 1800-29/800-53).


  Refocus on forensics (disk imaging, carving, partitions, slack, timelines) per voter accuracy note; include sanitization/encryption
  as post-analysis.
