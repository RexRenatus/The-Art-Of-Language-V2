active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between extended log retention for compliance (per NIST SP 800-92 and OMB Memorandum
    M-21-31 on cybersecurity log management improvements) and privacy risks in database transaction logging. Consider real-world
    scenarios like GDPR violations and justify positions with evidence.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., confuse transaction logs with audit logs).'
    - 'Distractor 2: Plausible but incomplete (e.g., general system log instead of DB-specific).'
    - 'Distractor 3: Extreme or unrelated (e.g., privacy overemphasis ignoring compliance).'
    - Ensure distractors are realistic, derived from research context or voter-noted pitfalls.
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Database Forensics under\
  \ the topic 'Transaction Log Analysis' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Investigation Types >\
  \ Digital Forensics Investigation Types > Database Forensics > Transaction Log Analysis).\n\nIncorporate this research context:\
  \ Transaction log analysis examines DB logs (e.g., SQL Server t-logs, Oracle redo logs) for incidents per NIST SP 800-92\
  \ (Guide to Computer Security Log Management: generation/transmission/storage/access/disposal). Log data: event records\
  \ (csrc.nist.gov). Log management: full lifecycle. OMB M-21-31: Directs federal agencies to improve cybersecurity log management\
  \ planning (full: 'Improving Implementation of the Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Strategy' with log retention emphases).\
  \ Sources: NIST SP 800-92 (csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-92/final), SP 800-92 Rev. 1 Draft (csrc.nist.gov), OMB\
  \ M-21-31 (whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda).\n\nUse these pedagogical elements:\n- Learning Objectives: [insert full list from\
  \ above JSON].\n- Scaffolding Layers: [insert full scaffolding from above JSON].\n- Active Learning for context/inspiration:\
  \ [insert full active_learning from above JSON].\n\nGenerate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Spaced Repetition\
  \ (active recall, spaced practice). Cover all objectives/Bloom's levels and layers progressively. Align to university pedagogy:\
  \ measurable, scaffolded, with real-world DB forensics focus.\n\nFollow Flashcard Schema exactly:\n[insert full flashcard_schema\
  \ from above JSON]\n\nOutput ONLY a JSON array of 50 flashcard objects, e.g.:\n[\n  {\n    \"type\": \"mcq\",\n    \"front\"\

  \ examples (SQL Server/Oracle)."
