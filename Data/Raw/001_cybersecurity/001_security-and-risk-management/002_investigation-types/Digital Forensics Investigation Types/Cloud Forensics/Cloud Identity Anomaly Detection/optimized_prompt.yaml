  discussion_prompt: 'Review this AWS CloudTrail log snippet: ''User ''admin'' logged in from IP 198.51.100.1 (new location),
    accessed 50GB S3 bucket, executed rm -rf on EC2.'' Discuss: Is this an anomaly? What baseline factors (time, volume, commands)
    indicate risk? How would false positives impact SOC triage? Share mitigations.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [insert full array above].

  - Prior knowledge & connections: [insert scaffolding.prior_knowledge].

  - Scaffolding layers: [insert full scaffolding layers 1-4].

  - Active learning: Use log snippets/discussions in 20% of cards.

  - Research: Definitions (e.g., baseline=expected patterns; anomalies=deviations; tools=GuardDuty/Sentinel/Chronicle; techniques=ML/statistical/rule-based;
  examples=unusual IP/exfil).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"id":1, "type":"MCQ", "front":"Question text", "options":["A","B","C","D"]
  (if MCQ), "answer":"B", "explanation":"Rationale + layer/objective tie-in", "layer":"1", "bloom":"REMEMBER"}.


  Follow flashcard_schema exactly: Balance layers/Bloom''s; distractors plausible; explanations pedagogical. Ensure progressive
  scaffolding in card order (10% L1, 25% L2, 35% L3, 30% L4). No external additions.'
