  ## Cloud Service Provider Activity Monitoring: Comprehensive Summary


  CSP activity monitoring: Continuous observation/collection/analysis/reporting of events in CSP infrastructure for security/compliance.
  Key elements: Logging (event records: app/system/network/security), Telemetry (remote metrics/health), Auditing (compliance
  checks), Alerting (notifications), Incident Response (IR procedures), Continuous Monitoring (ongoing control assessment).


  Shared Responsibility Model: CSP secures physical infra/hypervisor; customer secures OS/apps/data/config/identity.


  Standards/Frameworks:

  - NIST SP 800-144: Guidelines on Security/Privacy in Public Cloud Computing (monitor customer data, logs from hypervisor/host).

  - NIST SP 800-53 Rev5: AU (Audit/Accountability: AU-2/3/6/12 logging/monitoring), SI-4 System Monitoring.

  - NIST SP 800-207: Zero Trust Architecture (continuous monitoring/validation, assume breach).

  - ISO 27017: Cloud-specific ISO 27002 (A.12.4 Logging/monitoring, A.14.2.7 event detection).

  - CSA CCM v4: MCC (Monitoring/Logging), AUD (Audit Logging), LOG (Logging).


  CSP Examples:

  - AWS: CloudTrail (API calls/management events, S3 delivery), CloudWatch (logs/metrics/alarms), GuardDuty (ML threats).

  - Azure: Azure Monitor/Log Analytics (unified logs), Sentinel (SIEM/ML), Activity Logs.

  - GCP: Cloud Audit Logs (Admin/Data/System activity), Cloud Monitoring/Logging, Security Command Center.


  Best Practices: Enable comprehensive logging, centralize (SIEM), retain 90-365 days, encrypt, integrate IR/Zero Trust/ML
  anomaly.

  Generate EXACTLY 25 flashcards in VALID JSON ARRAY ONLY. No markdown/extra text. Follow schema precisely: each item has
  question (MCQ), correct_answer, explanation, distractors (EXACTLY 3: {text, explanation}), bloom_level (enum), scaffolding_layer
  (1-4). Cover all objectives/layers evenly. Questions from research only. Distractors plausible (e.g., swap NIST pubs, confuse
  AWS services). Ensure JSON parsable (escape strings).'
