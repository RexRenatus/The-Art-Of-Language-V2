  discussion_prompt: In a cybersecurity supply chain dispute over a vendor's failure to meet SLA during a data breach, argue
    the pros and cons of party-to-party negotiation versus escalating to litigation. Provide real-world examples (e.g., SolarWinds
    breach vendor disputes).
  peer_teaching: 'Pair up: One student explains TPRM and C-SCRM using NIST CSF functions (e.g., Identify, Govern), then the
    partner teaches back the step-by-step party-to-party dispute resolution process. Switch roles and discuss misconceptions.'
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A cloud provider and client disagree on breach responsibility after a misconfiguration incident.
    In groups, design a step-by-step party-to-party resolution plan applying NIST SP 800-61 incident handling coordination
    and TPRM frameworks. Present and peer-review.'

  **Full Topic Content (Web-Grounded, Completed from Authoritative Sources):**

  Party-to-Party Dispute Resolution: Direct negotiation between parties (e.g., client-vendor) over cyber issues like SLA breaches,
  without third-party courts/arbiters. Key in TPRM/C-SCRM.

  - NIST CSF 2.0: Govern (GV) for oversight; GV.SC manages supply chain disputes via risk tiers.

  - NIST SP 800-61r2: Incident handling includes party coordination (e.g., notifications, joint analysis).

  - NIST SP 800-161r1: C-SCRM practices for contract clauses.

  Steps: 1) Notify/Communicate; 2) Share evidence; 3) Negotiate remediation; 4) Document agreement.

  Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/framework); SP 800-61r2 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf);
  SP 800-161r1 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-161r1); ISO 27036 (supplier relationships).

  Big Picture: Internal → Party-to-Party → Civil → Criminal investigations.


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the learning_objectives array here].

  - Scaffolding: Use 4 layers progressively in flashcards (Layer 1 defs, Layer 4 integration).

  - Active Learning Context: Tie to discussions (e.g., negotiation vs litigation), scenarios (cloud breach).


  **Generation Rules:**

  - Align to Bloom''s: Balance levels as in objectives.

  - Schema: Output JSON array. Each card: {''front'': ''Question'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...
  (cite source, Bloom level)'', ''distractors'': [''A'', ''B'', ''C''] or null}, ''type'': ''MCQ/ShortAnswer'', ''layer'':
  1-4}.

  - Distractors: Follow protocol (plausible misconceptions).

  - Optimized: Concise fronts, rich backs. Ensure active recall, no hints.

  - Prerequisites: Assume TPRM/SLA knowledge.
