active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss the ethical challenges of balancing rapid CSAM takedown with preserving chain-of-custody evidence
    in ICAC cases. How does inter-agency coordination via ICAC Task Forces address these? Support with real-world examples
    from OJJDP reports.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
