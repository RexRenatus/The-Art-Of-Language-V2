        "core_logic": "NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (AC-3) enforces access authorizations because this is the core mechanism for implementing the principle of least privilege. By ensuring only authorized access is granted, it prevents unauthorized users and processes from accessing sensitive information and system resources, thereby maintaining confidentiality and integrity.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors misrepresent the purpose of access enforcement by suggesting automatic granting, confusing it with logging functions, or conflating it with encryption, which are separate security controls.",
        "analogy": "Access enforcement is like a bouncer at a club checking IDs; they ensure only authorized individuals (based on a list) get in, not everyone who shows up."
