  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet, covering all Bloom''s levels, active learning ties, and
  4 scaffolding layers provided below. Ensure 100% coverage: 5-7 cards per layer, progressive difficulty, voter consensus
  integration (completeness with MITRE/CISA best practices, prior knowledge links to Level I attribution/incident response/threat
  intel).


  **Contextual Content:**

  - TTPs: Tactics (''why'', e.g., TA0001), Techniques (''how'', e.g., T1566), Sub-techniques/Procedures (granular).

  - MITRE ATT&CK: Core framework (https://attack.mitre.org/); Matrices: Enterprise etc.

  - Best Practices: CISA ATT&CK mapping (https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/attack); Use ATT&CK Navigator
  for visualization.

  - Prior Knowledge: Builds on Level I (tools), incident response fundamentals.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list from above]

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full layers from above]

  **Active Learning:** [Insert full components from above]


  **Output Schema:** Strictly follow flashcard_generation_schema. Generate exactly 30 cards, numbered 1-30, grouped by layer.
  Vary types; use real ATT&CK examples (e.g., T1059.001 PowerShell). Ensure distractors per protocol. No duplicates; promote
  active recall/metacognition.'
