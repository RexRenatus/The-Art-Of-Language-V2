active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Analyze a scenario from the Equifax breach where digital evidence integrity was compromised. Debate how
    NISTIR 8387 guidelines (e.g., hashing, chain of custody) could have prevented issues, and discuss trade-offs between investigation
    speed and evidence integrity. Consider legal implications for admissibility.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  \ integrity ensures no unauthorized alteration. Digital Evidence (DE): data on media/objects/LE-generated. Preservation\
  \ (maintain original) differs from acquisition (copying). NISTIR 8387: Preservation guidelines - sources (physical/digital/LE),\
  \ steps (write-blockers, hashing SHA-256/MD5, chain of custody), challenges (volatility/volume). NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5:\
