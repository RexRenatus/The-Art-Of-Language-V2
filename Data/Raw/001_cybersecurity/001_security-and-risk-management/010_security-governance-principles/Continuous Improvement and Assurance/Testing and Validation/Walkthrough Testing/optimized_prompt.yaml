active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of walkthrough testing versus automated static analysis
    tools in a DevSecOps pipeline. Consider factors like cost, coverage, and false positives, using real-world examples from
    OWASP or NIST guidelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
