active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a world of increasing supply chain attacks (e.g., SolarWinds), should organizations prioritize third-party
    audits over continuous monitoring? Debate using NIST CSF functions (e.g., Identify vs. Detect), providing evidence from
    NIST SP 800-53 SR controls, ISO 27001, or SOC 2, and real-world examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1 common misconception (e.g., confuse TPRM with internal
    audits), 1 related but incorrect term (e.g., NIST CSF ''Recover'' instead of ''Identify''), 1 exaggerated/overly broad
    (e.g., ''Eliminates all supply chain risks''). Ensure distractors are realistic, drawn from adjacent concepts like internal
    audits or basic compliance.'

  Use this comprehensive content:

  ### Core Concepts: Third-Party Audit (independent vendor assessment); TPRM/VRM (risk management for vendors); SCRM (supply
  chain risks); Due Diligence (verification).

  ### Standards: NIST CSF (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover for TPRM); NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 SR family (SR-1 Policy
  and Procedures, SR-2 Risk Assessment, SR-3 Supply Chain Controls, SR-4 Provenance, etc.); ISO 27001 A.15 (Supplier Relationships);
  SOC 2 (Security TSC); CIS Controls (e.g., 4. Secure Configuration); PCI DSS (Req. 12.8 for service providers).

  ### Implementation: Steps - Vendor tiering/selection, risk assessment, audit planning/execution, reporting/remediation,
  continuous monitoring.

  ### Examples: SolarWinds (SCRM failures); Effective: SOC 2 Type II reports reducing breach risks.

  ### Sources: NIST CSF v2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final),
  ISO 27001:2022, AICPA SOC 2, CIS Controls v8.
