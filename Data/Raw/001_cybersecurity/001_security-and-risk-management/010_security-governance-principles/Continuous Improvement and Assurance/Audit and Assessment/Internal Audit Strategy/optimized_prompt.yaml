active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: Students pair up; one explains the IIA's Cybersecurity Topical Requirements (TR) to their partner as if auditing
    a mock company, then switch roles to teach-back the development of a risk-based internal audit plan.
  problem_solving: In groups, design an internal audit strategy for a fictional fintech firm facing phishing risks. Prioritize
    audits based on NIST frameworks, allocate resources, and present findings using think-pair-share for feedback on control
    effectiveness.

  Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST ABOVE].

  Active Learning: Incorporate ties to [INSERT FULL ACTIVE LEARNING ABOVE] in explanations.

  Scaffolding: Structure flashcards across 4 layers [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING ABOVE]; ensure progression.


  Generate flashcards per exact schema [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD SCHEMA ABOVE]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''id'':1,
  ''front'':''...'', ''back'':{...}, ''type'':''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'':''...'', ''bloom_level'':''...''}, ...]. Cover
  all objectives/layers evenly, include formative MCQs with distractors, higher-order prompts (e.g., ''Critique this strategy...'').
