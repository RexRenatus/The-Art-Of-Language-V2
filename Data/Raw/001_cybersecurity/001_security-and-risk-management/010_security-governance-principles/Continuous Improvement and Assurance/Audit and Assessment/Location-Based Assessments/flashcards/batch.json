        "core_logic": "The attack surface is location-specific because each site has a unique configuration of accessible systems, networks, and physical access points; therefore, understanding these specific exposures is key to assessing local risk.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly claim universality, limit the scope to only physical aspects, or oversimplify it to user count, missing the nuanced, context-dependent nature of a location's attack surface.",
        "analogy": "It's like assessing the ways a specific house can be broken into (windows, doors, chimney) versus assessing the general concept of 'how houses can be broken into'."
