    cybersecurity relevance.'' Use NIST PS-4 and insider threat examples to support your position, considering misconceptions

  **Topic Context:** Exit interviews mitigate insider threats (e.g., data exfiltration) via structured feedback during offboarding,
  per NIST SP 800-53 Rev5 PS-4 Personnel Termination. Sources: hr.nih.gov (definitions), insights.sei.cmu.edu (insider threats),
  nist-sp-800-53-r5.bsafes.com (controls), ncsc.gov.uk (exfiltration), GSA IT Security Procedural Guide (CIO-IT Security-03-23).


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full learning_objectives array here].


  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Incorporate elements from [discussion_prompt, peer_teaching_activity, problem_solving_exercise]
  into 20% of flashcards (e.g., ''Based on this scenario...'').


  **Scaffolding Layers:** Ensure coverage across [insert full scaffolding_layers array here].


  **Prerequisites:** Builds on Personnel Security Policies (onboarding to offboarding).


  **Concept Map:** Exit Interviews (child of PS-4 Personnel Termination) → Mitigates Insider Threat/Risk ↔ Drives Retention
  Strategies → Triggers Access Revocation.


  **Misconceptions for Distractors:** Solely HR function (not security control); Informal chats vs. NIST-structured; No link
  to insider risks.


  **Task:** Generate 25 high-quality flashcards in JSON array format. Strictly follow the flashcard_schema:

  [Insert full flashcard_schema here].


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, e.g., [{''front'': {...}, ''back'': {...}}, ...]. Ensure Bloom''s progression, voter
  consensus (pedagogy, completeness, scaffolding), and web-grounded accuracy. Promote active learning and measurable outcomes.'
