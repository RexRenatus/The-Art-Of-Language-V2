  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on ''Holistic Approach Implementation'' using this optimized pedagogy:


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s Taxonomy):** [Insert full learning_objectives array here].

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full scaffolding_layers array here]. Ensure 20% coverage per layer, full completion of ISO/IEC
  27001 (ISMS: requirements, risk treatment, PDCA, Annex A 93 controls from 27002: organizational/people/physical/technological)
  and 27002 (guidance for controls supporting holistic risk mgmt).

  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Embed concepts from [active_learning_components] (e.g., scenarios for healthcare/ransomware,
  SolarWinds example).

  **Research Context:** Holistic = integrated ops/tech/people vs. siloed; NIST CSF 2.0 (6 functions: Govern-ID-PRO-DE-RE-RE);
  ERM integration (NISTIR 8286); cyber resilience.


  **Output Format:** JSON array of flashcards. Each: {"type": "Q&A|MCQ|Cloze", "front": "...", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation":
  "...", "metadata": {"bloom_level": "...", "layer": 1-4, "tags": ["..."]}}.

  Follow flashcard_generation_schema exactly: 40% Q&A, 30% MCQ (4 opts, 1 correct), 30% Cloze. Distractors per protocol. Prioritize
  completeness (ISO details, NIST Govern func). Varied difficulty, active recall focus. No duplicates.'
