active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages of Trike's stakeholder-focused Requirements Model over PASTA
    or STRIDE methodologies for enterprise risk management. Support arguments with examples from NIST CSF alignments and real-world
    pitfalls like overlooking non-technical actors.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Partial truth (e.g., correct component but wrong detail like 4-pt vs 5-pt scale); 3) Related but off-topic (e.g., NIST
    CSF function instead of Trike-specific). Ensure plausibility from research context; avoid randomness.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in threat modeling methodologies.\
  \ Generate 25 high-quality Anki-style flashcards for the topic 'Trike Framework' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And\
  \ Risk Management > Security Governance Principles > Threat Modeling and Management > Threat Modeling Methodologies > Trike\
  \ Framework).\n\nIncorporate these pedagogical elements:\n- Learning Objectives: [Paste the full learning_objectives array\
  \ here].\n- Active Learning: Draw from discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving for scenario-based cards.\n- Scaffolding:\
  \ Distribute cards: 6 Layer 1 (Foundation/prereqs), 7 Layer 2 (Components), 7 Layer 3 (Implementation/steps), 5 Layer 4\
  \ (Integration/comparisons).\n- Prior Knowledge: Assume basics like DFDs/CRUD; reinforce in explanations.\n- Research Context:\
  \ Trike uses Requirements Model (actor-asset-action matrix, CRUD), Implementation Model (DFDs), Risk Assessment (5-pt scale).\
  \ Aligns with NIST CSF/ISO 27001.\n- Best Practices: Step-by-step matrix/DFD creation; stakeholder validation; pitfalls\
  \ like oversimplification.\n\nFollow this exact output schema for each card as JSON objects in an array:\n[\n  {\n    \"\
  front\": \"Question text (MCQ or cloze)\",\n    \"back\": {\n      \"answer\": \"Correct response\",\n      \"explanation\"\

  \ Distractors per protocol: misconceptions, partial truths, related errors. Action verbs match Bloom's. SMART, measurable.\
  \ University-level rigor."
