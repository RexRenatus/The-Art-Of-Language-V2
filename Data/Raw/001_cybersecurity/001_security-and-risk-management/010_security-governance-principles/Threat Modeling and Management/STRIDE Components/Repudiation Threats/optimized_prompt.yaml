  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student teaches the other the key components of NIST AU-10 Non-repudiation controls, including
    implementation steps with digital signatures; switch roles and provide feedback.
  problem_solving: Design a non-repudiation mechanism for an e-commerce transaction scenario where a buyer denies authorizing
    a purchase; include digital signatures, AAL3 authenticators, and audit logging.

    rules:
    - '3 distractors per MCQ: Plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse Repudiation with Tampering/Denial of
      Service; mix up AAL1 with AAL3; cite wrong NIST control like AU-2).'
    - Ensure 1 highly plausible (near-miss, e.g., 'audit logs alone' vs. 'digital signatures + logs'), 1 superficial (obvious
      wrong), 1 tricky (partial truth).
    - 'Base on research: E.g., distractor ''Non-repudiation is ensured by passwords only'' (ignores AAL/crypto); ''AU-10 focuses
      on encryption'' (confuses with SC controls).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  using Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, and scaffolding. Generate 30 high-quality flashcards on ''Repudiation Threats''
  (STRIDE Components in Security Governance Principles).


  **Context:**

  - Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Governance Principles > Threat Modeling and Management
  > STRIDE Components > Repudiation Threats.

  - Key Sources: NIST SP 800-53 Rev5 AU-10 (Non-repudiation via digital signatures); NIST SP 800-63-4 (Higher AAL2/3 for crypto-proof
  non-repudiation); STRIDE model (Repudiation: denying actions).


  **Incorporate:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list from above].

  - Scaffolding: Layer 1 (Foundation: Definitions/STRIDE links), Layer 2 (NIST components/AALs), Layer 3 (Implementation steps),
  Layer 4 (STRIDE integration/threat modeling).

  - Active Learning Hooks: Embed one per card back (e.g., ''Debate: Digital sigs vs. logs'').


  **Output Format:** JSON array of 30 objects, each: {''id'':1-30, ''type'':''MCQ/Definition/etc.'', ''layer'':''1-4'', ''blooms_level'':''REMEMBER/etc.'',
  ''front'':''...'', ''back'':''...'', ''tags'':[''...''], ''source'':''...''}. Balance: 40% MCQ (with 4 options, mark correct),
  20% Definition, 20% Cloze, 20% Scenario.


  **Quality Rules:**

  - Cover all objectives/layers.

  - Distractors: 3 plausible per MCQ (common errors: confuse w/ other STRIDE; wrong NIST details).

  - Explanations: 1-2 sentences, tie to real-world/legal impact.

  - Optimized for Anki: Concise, spaced repetition-friendly.
