active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the relative effectiveness of tabletop exercises versus full-scale cyber
    drills for testing preparedness activities. Use NIST CSF Govern function and CIS Control 19 to support arguments, considering
    resource constraints and real-world outcomes from sources like CISA case studies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse BCP with DRP); 2) Partial truth/overgeneralization
    (e.g., NIST CSF only for recovery, ignoring Govern); 3) Irrelevant framework element (e.g., CIS Control 1 instead of 19).
    Ensure plausibility from research context; avoid randomness.'
