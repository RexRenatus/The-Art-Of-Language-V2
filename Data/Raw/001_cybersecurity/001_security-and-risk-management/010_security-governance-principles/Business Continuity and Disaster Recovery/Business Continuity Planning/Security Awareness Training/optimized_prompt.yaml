active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent does security awareness training reduce human error in cyber incidents? Debate using case
    studies like the 2020 Twitter Bitcoin scam and discuss misconceptions such as 'Passwords are enough security.'
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains role-based training (e.g., admin vs. regular user examples/non-examples) to
    their partner; switch roles and provide feedback.
  problem_solving: In groups, analyze a ransomware attack scenario disrupting BCP and design an SAT module to prevent recurrence,
    including NIST phases, metrics, and delivery methods.

  Incorporate this full research context: Security Awareness Training educates on threats/risks/best practices to build cybersecurity
  culture and reduce human risk. Key: role-based training, NIST SP 800-50 Rev1 ''Building an Enterprise-Wide Cybersecurity
  and Privacy Awareness and Training Program'' – Phases: 1. Plan (gap analysis, audience/needs assessment, goals/resources);
  2. Develop (tailored content, multi-modal delivery); 3. Implement (rollout, phishing sims, gamification); 4. Evaluate (metrics:
  knowledge tests, behavior observation, culture surveys, phishing rates; iterate for privacy culture). SAT develops cybersecurity/privacy
  culture.


  Use these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Active Learning: [insert summaries]

  - Scaffolding: 4 Layers [insert full descriptions, including concept map: SAT (center) → NIST Phases → Audience Segmentation
  → Metrics → BCP Integration → Culture]

  - Prior knowledge anchor: Phishing, malware basics.
