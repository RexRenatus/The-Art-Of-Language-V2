  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains the relationships between MTD, RTO, and RPO (e.g., RTO < MTD for buffer),
    while the other teaches back with a simple diagram, reinforcing understanding through active recall.
  problem_solving: 'For a fictional e-commerce company facing a ransomware outage (revenue loss $5,000/hour, reputational
    threshold at 12 hours), conduct a mini-BIA: quantify impacts over time intervals, plot cumulative impact, and derive MTD—then
    adjust RTO/RPO accordingly.'

  **Core Content from Research:** MTD = longest tolerable outage before unacceptable harm (financial/operational/reputational).
  Derived from BIA. RTO < MTD (restoration target). RPO = max data loss time. ISO 22301 guides BCMS. Calc steps: BIA → quantify
  impacts over time (e.g., $10k/hr loss) → plot impact vs. time → MTD = intolerable point. Prerequisites: Full BIA knowledge.

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [INSERT SCAFFOLDING OBJECT HERE] – Ensure progressive coverage.


  **Active Learning Ties:** Cards should support discussions (industry debates), peer-teaching (relations), problem-solving
  (calcs), role-play (scenarios).


  **Output:** JSON array of 25 flashcards, each strictly following this schema: [INSERT FLASHCARD SCHEMA STRUCTURE HERE].
  Balance: 4 REMEMBER (Layer 1), 5 UNDERSTAND (Layer 2), 6 APPLY/ANALYZE (Layer 3 w/ numerical ex), 5 EVALUATE (Layer 4),
  5 CREATE (Layer 4). Use step-by-step examples (e.g., ''Plot: 1hr=$10k, 10hr=$100k tolerable → MTD=10hr''). Distractors:
  Exactly 3, plausible (e.g., confuse RTO w/ MTD). Hierarchy verbatim in every card. No extra text.'
