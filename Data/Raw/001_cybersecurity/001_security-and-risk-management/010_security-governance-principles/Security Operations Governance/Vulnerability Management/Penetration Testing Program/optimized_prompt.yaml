active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of internal red teams versus external penetration testers
    for an organization's ongoing security program. Consider factors like cost, objectivity, and access to proprietary knowledge,
    referencing NIST SP 800-115 planning phase requirements.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse PTES phases with
    NIST); 2) Partial truth (e.g., valid for another framework); 3) Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., ''always illegal'').
    Ensure distractors are web-grounded from research (e.g., IBM definitions) and promote analysis by forcing comparison.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing Program
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Governance Principles > Security Operations Governance
  > Vulnerability Management > Penetration Testing Program). Use voter consensus (82.9% approval): Complete NIST SP 800-115
