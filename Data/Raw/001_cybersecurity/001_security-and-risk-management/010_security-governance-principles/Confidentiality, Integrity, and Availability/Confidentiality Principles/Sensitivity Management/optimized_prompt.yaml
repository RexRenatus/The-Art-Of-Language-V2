active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of over-classifying data as 'Restricted' (e.g., impacts
    on availability) versus under-classifying it (e.g., risks to confidentiality). Use NIST SP 800-53 PT controls to support
    arguments and relate to real-world breaches like Equifax.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Related but mismatched concept (e.g., Availability control for Confidentiality scenario), 3) Partial truth (e.g., low-impact
    control for high-sensitivity data). Ensure distractors test nuance in sensitivity levels or NIST controls.'

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for spaced repetition and Bloom''s Taxonomy progression. Cover all learning
  objectives, active learning elements, and 4 scaffolding layers. Ensure completeness: Include NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 details
  (AC-2: Manage accounts per sensitivity/need-to-know; AC-3: Enforce access; PT-2: Document PII authority; PT-3: Define PII
  purposes; PT-8: Transparency notices). Sensitivity levels: Public, Internal Use Only, Confidential, Restricted. Integrate
  CIA triad, RMF from NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2, real-world examples (e.g., healthcare PII as Confidential).


  Sources: NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf); NIST SP 800-37

  Distribute flashcards: 10 Layer 1 (REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND), 15 Layer 2 (UNDERSTAND/ANALYZE), 15 Layer 3 (APPLY/ANALYZE), 10
  Layer 4 (EVALUATE/CREATE). Include 5 tied to active learning (e.g., healthcare scenario, concept map nodes).


  Use exact schema: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''correct_answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'':
