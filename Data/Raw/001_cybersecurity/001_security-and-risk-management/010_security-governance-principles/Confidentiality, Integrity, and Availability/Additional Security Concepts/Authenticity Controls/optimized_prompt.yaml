  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the trade-offs of implementing NIST IAL1 vs. IAL3 for a healthcare app handling patient data:
    security benefits vs. usability, cost, and user friction. Use real-world breach examples like phishing attacks or deepfakes
    to support arguments, and address the misconception that higher IAL is always better.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
