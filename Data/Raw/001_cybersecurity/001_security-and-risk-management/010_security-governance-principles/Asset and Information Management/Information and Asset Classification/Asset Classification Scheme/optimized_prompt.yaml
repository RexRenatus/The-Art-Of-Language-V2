active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a company facing budget constraints, debate which assets should receive high protection levels and
    why, using NIST impact levels (low/moderate/high). Consider trade-offs between criticality, sensitivity, and cost.
  peer_teaching: 'Pair up: Student A teaches Student B the difference between asset sensitivity (e.g., customer PII requiring
    confidentiality) and criticality (e.g., reputation impacting operations) using real-world examples; switch roles and quiz
    each other on classifications.'
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: Classify assets for a healthcare provider (patient records, MRI machines, admin laptops, reputation).
    Assign CIA impact levels, propose corresponding controls, and present your scheme to the group, justifying choices.'

  distractor_protocol: Generate distractors as common misconceptions (e.g., confuse sensitivity with criticality; use similar
    terms like 'value' vs. 'impact'; reverse levels low/high). Ensure 70% plausible (real framework terms), 30% obvious errors.
    Limit to 3 max.
