active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In light of real-world supply chain attacks like SolarWinds or Log4j, debate whether maintaining a Supplier
    Services Inventory should be mandatory for all organizations. What are the key challenges in implementation (e.g., data
    collection, ongoing maintenance) and how can they be overcome (e.g., automation tools, governance policies)? Address misconceptions
    that inventories apply only to hardware, not services.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Ensure distractors are realistic based on research context and voter-noted misconceptions.
