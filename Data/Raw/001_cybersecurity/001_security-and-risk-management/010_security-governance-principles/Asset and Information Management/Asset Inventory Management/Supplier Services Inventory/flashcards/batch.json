This works by providing structured methods to align supplier capabilities with organizational security needs.",

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Failing to verify supplier security culture and SCRM practices introduces significant risk because the organization's own security posture becomes dependent on the supplier's potentially weak controls, since these services are integrated into the organization's operations. This works by highlighting the need for due diligence in assessing third-party risk.",

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Establishing clear C-SCRM roles and responsibilities is fundamental because it ensures that someone is accountable for managing supply chain risks, since effective risk management requires defined ownership. This works by integrating C-SCRM into the organizational structure and assigning specific duties.",
