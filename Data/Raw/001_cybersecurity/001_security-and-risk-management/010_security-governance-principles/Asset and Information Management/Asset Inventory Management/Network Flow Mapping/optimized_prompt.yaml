active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what ways does network flow mapping enhance or limit the NIST CSF Detect function compared to full
    packet inspection? Debate pros/cons with examples from recent breaches (e.g., SolarWinds), considering factors like privacy,
    performance overhead, and metadata-only insights.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    only''; ''Identify only'' vs ''All CSF functions''; ''Reveals content'' vs ''No payloads''). Ensure plausible (e.g., confuse
    flows with full capture, or NIST functions).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Network Flow Mapping (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Governance Principles > Asset and Information Management
  > Asset Inventory Management > Network Flow Mapping). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities,
  4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema to generate high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized flashcards.


  Incorporate:

  - Voter priorities: Tools (NetFlow, sFlow, IPFIX), NIST CSF 2.0 (ID.AM-1/3, PR.AC-6, DE.AE-1), prior links to asset inventory,
  concept map, hands-on datasets, formative MCQs (e.g., ''What does flow data consist of? B) Source/dest IP, ports, protocols''
  with distractors).

  - Research: Flow data as metadata (no payloads), supports NIST CSF Identify/Protect/Detect; standards like NIST SP 800-37
  Rev. 2 for RMF integration.

  - Pedagogy: Bloom''s progression, active elements (e.g., reference discussion on Detect vs packet inspection), scaffolding
  layers.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''front'': ''Question'', ''back'': ''Answer | Explanation | Bloom: Level | NIST:
  Ref | Recall: Prompt''}]. Ensure 20-30 cards, balanced types/layers, measurable verbs, distractors as specified. Sources:
