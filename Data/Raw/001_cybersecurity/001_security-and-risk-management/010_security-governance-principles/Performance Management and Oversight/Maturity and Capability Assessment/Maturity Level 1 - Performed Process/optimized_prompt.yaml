active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent can an organization survive at Maturity Level 1 in today's threat landscape? Debate using
    examples from recent breaches like SolarWinds or Log4j vulnerabilities, considering pros (agility in small firms) and
    cons (high risk exposure from reactive measures).
  peer_teaching: 'Think-Pair-Share: Individually note 3 characteristics of Maturity Level 1 (e.g., reactive vs. proactive,
    ad-hoc processes); pair up to teach your partner one concept and address misconceptions like assuming Level 1 means zero
    security; share group insights with the class.'
  problem_solving: 'Analyze this real-world scenario: A small e-commerce firm installs antivirus after a phishing attack but
    has no formal policies or risk assessments. Assess its maturity level, identify gaps in NIST CSF functions, and propose
    3 actionable steps to reach Level 2 (e.g., standardize documentation).'

    2 ''standardized''); 3) Plausible but exaggerated (e.g., ''full risk integration'' twisted). Ensure plausible, derived
    from research/voter misconceptions (e.g., Level 1 ≠ zero security).'

  pedagogy (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding) and best practices for Anki/Quizlet (active recall, spaced repetition,

  **Topic Context:**

  - Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Governance Principles > Performance Management and
  Oversight > Maturity and Capability Assessment > Maturity Level 1: Performed Process.

  - Voter Consensus: 67.1% approval (7 voters); integrate priorities: Bloom''s objectives, discussion/debate on survival (SolarWinds/Log4j),
  Think-Pair-Share peer teaching, e-commerce scenario problem-solving, complete best practices (risk inventories, FAR 52.204-21,
  incident docs), prior knowledge links (risks/threats).

  - Research: Maturity Level 1 = ''Performed/Initial/Partial'' (NIST CSF): Ad-hoc, reactive, limited awareness, fragmented
  controls. NIST functions rudimentary/uncoordinated. Sources: NIST CSF Maturity Model.


  **Pedagogical Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list from JSON above].

  - Active Learning: Inspire cards from discussion prompt, peer teaching (characteristics), problem-solving scenario.

  - Scaffolding: [Insert full layers from JSON above]. Ensure cards progress layers.


  **Generate 25 flashcards per ''flashcard_schema'' above.** Output ONLY a JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back_answer'':
  ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''blooms_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''type'': ''...''}, ...].

  - Cover all objectives/layers; include best practices for progression; misconceptions (e.g., Level 1 ≠ no security); real
  examples (phishing, breaches).

  - Optimize: Concise fronts (under 20 words), explanatory backs, distractors protocol strictly.'
