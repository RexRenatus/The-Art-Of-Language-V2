active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the top three benefits of mapping CIS Controls to NIST CSF 2.0 (e.g., risk
    reduction vs. compliance mapping) and provide real-world examples from industries like healthcare (HIPAA) or finance (GDPR).
    How does the new 'Govern' function change this alignment?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate this comprehensive content:

  - **Research Context (Completed):** CIS Controls (v8.1): Prioritized safeguards against common attacks. Mapping correlates
  Safeguards to NIST CSF 2.0 (includes ''Govern''), NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA. Benefits: Risk reduction (prioritize
  threats), compliance mapping (e.g., HIPAA audits), resource optimization (avoid duplication), gap analysis, efficiency (streamlined
  programs). Best Practices: Use official mappings from cisecurity.org; spreadsheets for custom; CIS-CAT for assessment. Sources:
  cisecurity.org/cis-controls (CIS Controls v8.1), cisecurity.org/controls/mapping (alignments), nist.gov/cyberframework (CSF
  2.0), Splunk blogs on CIS implementation.

  - **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives from above].

  - **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers from above].

  - **Active Learning:** Weave in elements like mapping exercises.

  - **Voter Consensus:** 100% approval; emphasize completeness (benefits, sources), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression), scaffolding.
