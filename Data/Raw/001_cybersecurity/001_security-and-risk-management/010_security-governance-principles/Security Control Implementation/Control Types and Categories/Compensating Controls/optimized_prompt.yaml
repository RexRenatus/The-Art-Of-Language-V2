  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Compensating controls are merely shortcuts that organizations
    use to avoid full compliance.'' Use NIST SP 800-53 references and real-world examples (e.g., biometric alternatives for
    legacy passwords) to argue for or against, considering risks like documentation gaps or reduced effectiveness.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
