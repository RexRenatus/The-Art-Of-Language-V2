active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a recent data breach like SolarWinds, which detective controls failed or succeeded, and why? Debate
    their role versus preventive controls, considering how detective controls provide visibility that preventive ones lack.
    Support arguments with examples from NIST or CIS Controls.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
