Therefore, when a component is found to be faulty or prohibited, the supplier cannot quickly identify which systems are affected. This inability to trace the component prevents timely remediation, leaving customers exposed to potential security, safety, or reliability issues because the scope of the problem is unknown. The SBOM provides the necessary traceability.",

This occurs because new ownership may have different priorities, potentially weaker security postures, or even direct ties to adversarial governments.

The lack of transparency into the new ownership's security practices is the core vulnerability.",
