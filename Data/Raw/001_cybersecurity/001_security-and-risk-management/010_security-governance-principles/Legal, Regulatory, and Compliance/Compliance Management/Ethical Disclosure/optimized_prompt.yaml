  discussion_prompt: 'Debate: ''Is a strict 90-day disclosure policy (e.g., Google Project Zero) always ethical, or should
    it depend on vulnerability severity and vendor responsiveness? Use the Heartbleed case study to argue trade-offs between
    rapid public awareness (to protect users) and responsible coordination (to enable fixes). Groups present pros/cons and
    vote on a hybrid policy.'''
  peer_teaching: 'Think-Pair-Share Teach-Back: In pairs, discuss and explain CVD vs. full disclosure using NIST SP 800-216

    public release''). Switch roles and share with the class.'
  problem_solving: 'Real-world scenario: As a bug bounty hunter, discover a zero-day in a cloud service. In groups, create
    a step-by-step ethical disclosure plan per ISO/IEC 29147, including timelines, communications, roles (finder, vendor,
    coordinator), and contingencies. Output a decision tree diagram and present solutions.'

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., full disclosure as ''always
    ethical''); 2) Extreme opposite (e.g., indefinite non-disclosure); 3) Partial truth (e.g., responsible but ignores coordination).
    Base on real standards/misconceptions from research (e.g., confuse CVD with full disclosure). Ensure distractors teach
    by contrast.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Topic: Ethical Disclosure (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk
  Management > Security Governance Principles > Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance > Compliance Management > Ethical Disclosure).
  Use this research summary: Ethical disclosure (CVD) coordinates vulnerability reporting/remediation before public release
  to minimize harm. Key terms: Vulnerability (exploitable weakness); CVD (collaborative process); Responsible (ethical CVD);
  Full (immediate public); Non-disclosure (secret). Standards: NIST SP 800-216 (CVD steps: report/triage/remediate/disclose);
  ISO/IEC 29147 (roles: reporter/vendor/coordinator; processes: intake/validation/remediation/disclosure, e.g., ack in 3 days);
  ISO/IEC 30111 (handling processes). Cases: Heartbleed, Google 90-day policy.


  Incorporate: Learning objectives [paste array]; Active learning [discussion/peer/problem-solving]; Scaffolding [4 layers
  with key_content]; Voter consensus (100% approval on pedagogy/completeness/discussion/etc.).


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (10 per Bloom''s pair: Remember/Understand, Apply/Analyze, Evaluate/Create; balance
  types per schema). Output JSON array: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'',
  ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...''}]. Follow flashcard_schema exactly: structures, 3 distractors/MCQ
  (plausible via misconceptions), explanations with all requirements. Ensure web-grounded (cite NIST/ISO), measurable, engaging.
  Prioritize active recall, misconceptions (e.g., disclosure ≠ immediate release).'
