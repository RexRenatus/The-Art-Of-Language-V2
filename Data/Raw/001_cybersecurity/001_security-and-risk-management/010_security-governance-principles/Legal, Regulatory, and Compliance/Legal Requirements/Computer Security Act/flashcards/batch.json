Therefore, it established a framework for managing federal computer security.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractor 1 is incorrect because the CSA focused on minimum requirements, not specific algorithms. Distractor 2 is incorrect as it describes a later development in IT professional certification. Distractor 3 is incorrect because the CSA predates significant internet regulation and focused on internal federal systems.",

        "core_logic": "The Computer Security Act of 1987 includes privacy as a key consideration by defining sensitive information broadly to encompass PII, recognizing that protecting individual privacy is as crucial as protecting national security. Therefore, agencies must integrate privacy protections into their security plans and practices, ensuring a holistic approach to data stewardship.",
        "distractor_analysis": "CSA's definition is not limited to 'Secret' or higher classifications. It focuses on potential harm, not just non-publicity. Privacy considerations apply broadly, not just outside national security systems.",
        "analogy": "The CSA's approach to privacy is like a library ensuring that patron borrowing records (PII) are kept confidential, alongside protecting the books themselves (other sensitive information) from damage or theft."
