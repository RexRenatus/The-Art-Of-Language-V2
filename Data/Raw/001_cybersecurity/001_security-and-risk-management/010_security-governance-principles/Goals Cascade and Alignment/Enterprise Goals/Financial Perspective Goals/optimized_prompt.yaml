  discussion_prompt: 'Debate: How should a company''s risk appetite influence cybersecurity budget allocation during economic
    downturns? Use real-world examples like the Equifax breach ($1.4B cost) and IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report (average
    $4.45M in 2023). Consider positive risks such as cyber investments boosting customer trust and revenue.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Semantic similar but imprecise (e.g., swap appetite/tolerance);
    2) From related but wrong concept (e.g., NIST IDENTIFY instead of GOVERN); 3) Extreme/realistic error (e.g., ignore positive
    risks). Ensure plausible for learners at intermediate level.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security Governance Principles.\
  \ Topic: Financial Perspective Goals (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Governance Principles\
  \ > Goals Cascade and Alignment > Enterprise Goals > Financial Perspective Goals).\n\nIncorporate these pedagogical elements:\n\
  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM 'learning_objectives']\n- Active Learning: Use concepts from [INSERT FULL\
  \ FROM 'active_learning'] for contextual examples.\n- Scaffolding: Base flashcards on 4 layers [INSERT FULL FROM 'scaffolding_layers'],\
  \ progressing from basic to integrated.\n- Research Context: Financial Perspective Goals quantify cyber risk economics (costs,\
  \ ROI, ALE=SLE×ARO). Align with ERM, Goals Cascade. NIST CSF GOVERN (risk strategy), full functions: IDENTIFY (risk assessment),\
  \ PROTECT/DETECT/RESPOND/RECOVER (financial impacts). Positive risks: gains from security (e.g., trust/revenue). Cases:\
  \ Equifax $1.4B, IBM $4.45M avg. Sources: NIST (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), COBIT (https://www.isaca.org/resources/cobit),\
  \ IBM (https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach).\n\nGenerate 25 high-quality flashcards following this exact schema:\nFor\
  \ each:\n{\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"bloom_level\": \"REMEMBER\",\n  \"scaffolding_layer\": 1,\n  \"objective_link\": 1,\n  \"\
  type\": \"MCQ\" or \"Q&A\" or \"cloze\",\n  \"front\": \"Question text...\",\n  \"back\": {\n    \"answer\": \"Correct...\"\

  \ Bloom's progression. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards."
