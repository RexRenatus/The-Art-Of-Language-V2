  ## IT Benefits Realization in Cybersecurity

  Core Concepts: Process ensuring IT/cybersecurity investments achieve sustained benefits (value proposition: e.g., risk reduction;
  metrics: e.g., MTTD, ROI; alignment: business-IT goals; continuous improvement).

  NIST CSF 2.0: 6 Functions (Govern: risk strategy/policy; Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover). Profiles (Current/Target),
  Tiers (Partial/Risk Informed/Repeatable/Adaptive), Informative References (SP 800-53, ISO 27001).

  Other: COBIT 2019 (value delivery), ISO 27001 (control effectiveness).

  Prerequisites: Builds on Goals Cascade (business-to-IT) and IT-Related Goals.

  Concept Map: IT Benefits Realization → Value Proposition → Metrics → Alignment → Continuous Improvement ↔ NIST CSF Govern.

  Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (nist.gov/cyberframework), COBIT 2019 (isaca.org), ISO/IEC 27001:2022 (iso.org), NIST SP 800-53 Rev
