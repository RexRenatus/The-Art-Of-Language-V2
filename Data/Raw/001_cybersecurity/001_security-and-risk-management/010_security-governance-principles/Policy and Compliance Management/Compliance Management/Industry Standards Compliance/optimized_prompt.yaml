active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent does compliance with industry standards like NIST CSF guarantee cybersecurity? Use real-world
    examples of compliant organizations (e.g., Equifax breach despite PCI DSS compliance) that suffered breaches to discuss
    limitations and the difference between compliance and security.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    NIST CSF as legally binding like GDPR); 2) Framework mix-up (e.g., SOC 2 criteria as ISO controls); 3) Overgeneralization
    (e.g., ''ISO 27001 only for software''); 4) Partial truths (e.g., ''HIPAA applies only to US healthcare providers'' ignoring
    business associates). Ensure distractors are realistic from research context.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Industry Standards Compliance''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Governance Principles > Policy and Compliance
  Management > Compliance Management > Industry Standards Compliance). Use the provided research context, key frameworks (NIST
  CSF, ISO 27001, SOC 2 [Trust Services Criteria: Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, Privacy],
  PCI DSS, GDPR, HIPAA, FedRAMP, CIS Controls), and voter consensus for completeness.


  Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives [insert learning_objectives array], active learning activities
  [insert active_learning object for inspiration], and 4 scaffolding layers [insert scaffolding_layers object] for progressive
  depth.


  Generate 32-48 high-quality flashcards following the exact schema [insert flashcard_schema object]. Ensure web-grounded
  accuracy (e.g., NIST voluntary, ISO certifiable, regulations binding). Cover misconceptions (e.g., compliance ≠ security).
  Output as JSON array of objects: [{''type'': ''MCQ/Definition/etc.'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''blooms_level'':
  ''Remember/etc.'', ''layer'': ''1-4'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors_addressed'': [''list'']}, ...].


  Optimize for Anki/Spaced Repetition: Questions active/recall-focused, explanations actionable with feedback/remediation.
  Balance layers evenly.'
