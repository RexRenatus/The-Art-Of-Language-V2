active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the consequences of infrequent policy reviews in light of recent high-profile
    cyber incidents (e.g., SolarWinds breach). How do NIST CSF GOVERN subcategories like GV.OC-05 support more adaptive review
    mechanisms?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., from another domain). Ensure plausible based on NIST nuances.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert educational flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity pedagogy. Generate high-quality
  Anki-style flashcards for the topic ''Policy Review Mechanisms'' (Category: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management
  > Security Governance Principles > Policy and Compliance Management > Policy Lifecycle Management > Policy Review Mechanisms).


  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives**: [Paste the full learning_objectives array here]. Cover all levels across cards.

  - **Scaffolding**: Structure content across 4 layers: [Paste full scaffolding array]. Dedicate ~10 cards per layer.

  - **Active Learning**: Infuse prompts linking to [discussion_prompt], [peer_teaching_activity], [problem_solving_exercise].

  - **Research Context**: Use NIST CSF 2.0 (GOVERN: GV.OC-05 policy review), SP 800-53 Rev5 PM-1 (policy/procedures: review
  frequencies/triggers, update, disseminate), PM-9 (risk strategy review), AC-1/AU-1 (family policies). Triggers: regulations,
  incidents, tech changes. Frequencies: annual or event-driven. ISO 27001 A.5.1.1 for policies. Sources: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final,
  https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework, https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.29.pdf.

  - **Prior Knowledge**: Link to Policy Development and Governance Principles.

  - **Concept Map**: Policy Lifecycle node: Develop→Implement→Review (triggers/freq/NIST PM)→Update → CSF GOVERN.


  **Output Format**: JSON array of objects, e.g., [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''source'': ''...'', ''active_learning_link'': ''...''}}, ...]. Follow flashcard_schema exactly: Varied fronts (Q&A 40%,
  Cloze 30%, MCQ 30% with distractors). 40-50 cards total. Ensure university-level rigor, active recall, spaced repetition
  optimization. Explanations reference Bloom''s/scaffolding.'
