active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the differences between risk appetite and risk tolerance in the context
    of a cybersecurity breach scenario (e.g., ransomware attack). How should COBIT APO12.02 influence decision-making? Support
    with examples from NIST CSF.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    tolerance), 2) Similar term mix-up (e.g., threat vs vulnerability), 3) Partial truth from another framework (e.g., NIST
    CSF function mistaken for RMF step). Ensure distractors test nuance without being obviously wrong.'
