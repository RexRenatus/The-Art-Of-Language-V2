active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In light of real-world incidents like the SolarWinds supply chain attack or the AWS shared responsibility
    model, debate the critical gaps in service agreements that led to breaches. How can COBIT APO09 and NIST SA-9 prevent
    similar issues? Support your arguments with specific controls and voter-suggested enhancements.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
