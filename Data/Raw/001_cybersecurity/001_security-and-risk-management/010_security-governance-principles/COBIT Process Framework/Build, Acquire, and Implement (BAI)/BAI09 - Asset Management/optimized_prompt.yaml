  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, Partner A explains the full asset lifecycle stages under BAI09 (identification, acquisition, operation,
    maintenance, disposal) with a real-world example (e.g., software license from purchase to decommissioning). Partner B
    teaches back by applying it to a peer-chosen asset and summarizing BAI09 controls. Switch roles and provide feedback.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A mid-sized healthcare provider suffered a ransomware attack due to untracked shadow IT assets.
    Using COBIT BAI09, design a step-by-step asset inventory process (including classification, controls, and monitoring)
    to mitigate future risks. Include tools like automated discovery software and link to NIST ID.AM. Present and iterate
    based on group feedback.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in COBIT frameworks. Generate
  20-30 high-quality, spaced-repetition-optimized flashcards for the topic ''BAI09: Asset Management'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > Security And Risk Management > Security Governance Principles > COBIT Process Framework > Build, Acquire, and Implement
  (BAI) > BAI09: Asset Management). Integrate university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives [insert learning_objectives
  array here], active learning inspirations [discussion/peer/problem-solving], and 4-layer scaffolding [insert scaffolding
  object here].


  Core content from research: CSAM (cybersecurity asset inventory), assets (tangible/intangible), critical assets (high-impact),
  COBIT BAI09 (inventory/lifecycle/BAI09.02 criticality), NIST ID.AM, SP 800-53 (CM-8, PM-5), lifecycle (acq-op-maint-dispose),
  automation, compliance (GDPR). Big picture: Enables COBIT governance/risk decisions. Misconceptions/examples/concept map
  as in scaffolding.


  Strictly follow the flashcard_schema [insert schema here]. Ensure flashcards progress from foundation to integration, span
  Bloom levels, promote active recall. Output ONLY the JSON array of flashcards, no extra text.'
