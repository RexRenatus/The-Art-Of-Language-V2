active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between thorough contractor background checks (e.g., full
    BI vs. tiered screening) and project timelines. Use real-world examples from federal contracts and reference NIST SP 800-53
    to support arguments on risk mitigation vs. cost.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    but incorrect term/level (e.g., low-risk for high-risk req); 3) Outdated/irrelevant standard (e.g., old EO). Ensure distractors
    test nuance from scaffolding layers.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Personnel Security. Use
  the provided scaffolding, learning objectives, active learning components, and flashcard schema to create 40-50 high-quality
  flashcards on ''Contractor Background Check Requirements''.


  **Topic Context (Voter Consensus 82.9%):** Complete coverage including truncated sections. Continuous Vetting (CV): Ongoing
  automated process under Trusted Workforce 2.0 to monitor personnel for eligibility changes (e.g., arrests, financial issues)
  post-initial BI. Applies to contractors via enrollment after suitability determination. Specific checks: Criminal (FBI fingerprints/NCIC),
  credit (for moderate/high risk), employment/education verification, references. Standards: NIST SP 800-53 Rev5 (PS-3 Personnel
  Screening), NIST SP 800-171, FAR 52.204-9 (PIV), DFARS 252.204-7012 (CUI safeguarding), HSPD-12, EO 13467.


  **Full Research Summary:** [Insert full scaffolding layers here verbatim]. Prior Knowledge: PII/CUI from foundational topics.


  **Instructions:**

  1. Strictly follow flashcard_schema structure and distractor_protocol.

  2. Tie flashcards to Bloom''s objectives and scaffolding layers.

  3. Ensure pedagogical depth: Explanations reference active learning (e.g., ''Apply in problem-solving exercise'').

  4. Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''1-4'', ''blooms_level'':
  ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...''}].

  5. Make engaging, precise, and exam-ready for CISSP/CISM-style questions.
