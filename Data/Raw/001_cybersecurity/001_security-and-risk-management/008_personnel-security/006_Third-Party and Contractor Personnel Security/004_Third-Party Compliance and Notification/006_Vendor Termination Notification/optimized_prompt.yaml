  **Full Synthesized Content (Web-Grounded, Completed per NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5):**

  - **Foundation:** Vendor termination notification: Formal process to securely end vendor relationships, preventing risks
  like data exfiltration. Types: Normal (contract expiry), Adverse (breach/performance), Unfriendly (disputes/security incidents).

  - **NIST Controls:** SR-13 (Supplier Inventory: Maintain supplier lists, criteria, termination procedures including access
  revocation and asset return); SA-9 (External System Services: Agreements must specify termination rights, transition plans);
  PS-4 (Personnel Termination: For contractors – final security checks, NDA reminders); AC-2 (Account Management: Automate
  revocation). Aligns with NIST CSF ID.SC-4, RS.SC-2.

  - **Process:** 1. Contract review/notify (e.g., 30-90 days); 2. Revoke access; 3. Retrieve assets/data; 4. Audit/exit interview;
  5. Document/update inventory; 6. Monitor post-term.

  - **Integration:** Supply chain risk (SolarWinds: Terminations revealed unmonitored access); Tools: Okta/SailPoint for auto-revoke;
  Legal: Data sovereignty. Checklist example: [Notify→Revoke→Retrieve→Audit→Close].

  **Sources:** NIST SP 800-53r5 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r5); NIST CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework);
  ISO 27001:2022 A.5.19/8.1.3; CISA Supply Chain Guidance (https://www.cisa.gov/supply-chain).


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [insert the 6 objectives above].

  - Scaffolding: Cover Layers 1-4 evenly.

  - Active Learning Tie-In: Flashcards support discussion (e.g., risk scenarios), peer quiz, problem-solving (step sequences).


  **Flashcard Generation Rules:** Follow exact schema: {type, front, back, explanation, distractors (array or null), bloom_level,
  scaffolding_layer, related_objective}. 60% Q/A/cloze, 40% MCQ (4 options, label correct). Distractors: Plausible errors
  (e.g., ''SR-13 is only for inventory, not termination''). Ensure progression: Layers 1-2 lower Bloom''s, 3-4 higher. Varied
  difficulty.
