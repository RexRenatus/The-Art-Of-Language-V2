  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full array from above]

  - Active Learning: Tie explanations to activities (e.g., ''Relates to discussion on CE pros/cons'').

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste full scaffolding object from above]. Distribute flashcards progressively across layers.

  - Voter Priorities: Ensure completeness (full NIST SP 800-137A: ISCM assessment of strategies/policies/operations; sources:
