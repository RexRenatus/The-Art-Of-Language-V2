active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of security clearance denials, debate whether the adjudicative guidelines (e.g., SEAD
    4) strike the right balance between protecting national security and upholding individual due process rights. Use specific
    examples from the guidelines, ICD 704 procedures, and real-world cases to support your position.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    confusing LOI with LOD); 3) Edge case or outdated practice. Ensure distractors are educationally valuable for differential
    learning, grounded in SEAD 4/ICD 704.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, adhering to university pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for the topic ''Clearance
  Denial and Appeals Process'' in exact topic_hierarchy: [''Cybersecurity'', ''Security And Risk Management'', ''Personnel
  Security'', ''Pre-Employment Security'', ''Security Clearance Processing'', ''Clearance Denial and Appeals Process''].


  Incorporate these learning_objectives: [paste the array above]. Use active_learning components for inspiration (e.g., scenario-based
  Qs from problem-solving). Structure content across 4 scaffolding layers: [paste scaffolding object above]. Research context:
  Core concepts include Security Clearance (eligibility determination), Denial/Revocation, Adjudication via SEAD 4''s 13 guidelines
  (e.g., Allegiance, Foreign Influence), SOR/LOI/LOD process; ICD 704 for IC standards (https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20704.pdf);
  appeals via DOHA (https://www.dodig.mil/Components/Administrative-Investigations/Defense-Office-of-Hearings-and-Appeals/).

  Big picture: Essential for mitigating insider threats in Security Risk Management. Prior knowledge: Builds on clearance
  eligibility.


  Output a JSON array of 24 flashcards (6 per layer). Each follows exact flashcard_schema: {front, back, distractors: [3 items],
  explanation, metadata}. Ensure progressive Bloom''s coverage, exactly 3 distractors (plausible via protocol), verbatim hierarchy
  in metadata. Cards must promote active recall, spaced repetition, and integration (e.g., apply to case studies).'
