active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a rapidly growing tech company with 500 employees, how often should access reviews be conducted to
    balance compliance with productivity? Debate the pros and cons using NIST CSF (Protect function), ISO 27001 (A.9.2.3 management
    of privileged access), and SOC 2 (CC6.3) as references, considering metrics like review completion rate (>95% target),
    overdue access revocations (<5%), and links to insider threat mitigation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Access reviews are annual only''
    vs. periodic); 2) Plausible but incorrect metric (e.g., 50% completion rate as ''good''); 3) Confused standard (e.g.,
    attribute HIPAA req to SOX). Ensure distractors teach by contrast in explanations.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Access Review Compliance
  Tracking (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Personnel Security > Special Considerations and
  Advanced Topics > Metrics and Program Effectiveness > Access Review Compliance Tracking).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full array from learning_objectives above]

  - Active Learning: Use discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving to inspire higher-order cards (e.g., debate frequency, case
  study analysis).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [insert full scaffolding_layers details above]; tag each card with layer
  and Bloom''s level.

  - Prior Knowledge: Link to Access Control, Least Privilege, RBAC, provisioning.

  - Metrics: KPIs like % timely reviews, violations detected.

  - Standards: NIST CSF, ISO 27001, SOC 2 (CC6.3), SOX, HIPAA.

  - Big Picture: Quantifiable risk reduction in Personnel Security.


  Generate flashcards per schema [insert full flashcard_schema above]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 50 flashcards, each as
  an object with ''front'', ''back'' (nested object), and ''metadata''. Ensure variety: 40% MCQ with distractors, 30% cloze,
  30% short answer. High-quality, exam-ready, with explanations reinforcing integration.'
