active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether routine events like user logins should be included in security event
    reporting mechanisms or only adverse events and incidents. Use NIST SP 800-61 definitions and examples to support your
    position. Consider misconceptions such as over- or under-reporting, and connect to CSF 2.0 Detect and Respond functions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
  additional_activities:
  - 'Role-playing: Simulate an incident response team meeting for a data breach, assigning roles (e.g., reporter, analyst)
    and practicing event classification and escalation.'
  - 'Think-pair-share: Share examples and non-examples of reportable events, then pair to refine classifications.'
  - 'Group project: Develop an organization’s event reporting policy, including thresholds, tools (e.g., ticketing systems),
    and metrics for evaluation.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security Event Reporting
  Mechanisms (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Personnel Security > Special Considerations
  and Advanced Topics > Event Reporting and Response > Security Event Reporting Mechanisms). Use the provided research context,
  voter consensus (70% approval), and pedagogical elements to create optimized Anki-style flashcards.


  **Research Context (Completed for Completeness):** Security event reporting mechanisms systematically collect, analyze,
  and disseminate info on events, incidents, vulnerabilities. Core Definitions: Event (observable occurrence on assets); Adverse
  Event (negative consequence, e.g., power failure); Cybersecurity Incident (jeopardizes CIA triad or violates policies, e.g.,
  breaches). NIST SP 800-61r3 Lifecycle: Preparation (policies, teams), Detection/Analysis (events to incidents), Containment/Eradication/Recovery,
  Post-Incident (lessons learned). CSF 2.0: Aligns Detect (events), Respond (incidents). Best Practices: Clear reporting chains
  (employee → SOC → leadership), tools (SIEM, ticketing like ServiceNow), thresholds (e.g., report all adverse events), training,
  anonymity, metrics (time-to-report <1hr), integrate with risk mgmt. Sources: NIST SP 800-61r3, CSF 2.0, related: IR lifecycle,
  personnel security.
