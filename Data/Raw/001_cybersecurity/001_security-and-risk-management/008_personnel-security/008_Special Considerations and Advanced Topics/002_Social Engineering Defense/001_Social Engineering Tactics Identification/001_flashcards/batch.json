      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Smishing is a specific type of phishing because it functions by adapting the social engineering principles of phishing to the SMS (text message) channel, which is prevalent on mobile devices. This tactic is effective because mobile devices are often perceived as more secure or personal, making users potentially less guarded.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly define Smishing as a technical exploit, Vishing (voice calls), or a physical baiting tactic. Smishing's core is phishing via SMS.",
        "analogy": "Smishing is like receiving a text message from a fake delivery company asking you to click a link to reschedule your package, whereas phishing uses email and vishing uses phone calls for similar scams."

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Identifying social engineering tactics is critical for risk management because it allows organizations to proactively defend against human-based threats, functioning as a cornerstone of a robust security posture. Therefore, understanding these tactics enables tailored employee training and the selection of appropriate technical and procedural controls to mitigate risks.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors overstate the benefits (guaranteed prevention, AI countermeasures) or misrepresent the primary driver (compliance). The core value lies in enabling targeted, effective defense strategies.",
