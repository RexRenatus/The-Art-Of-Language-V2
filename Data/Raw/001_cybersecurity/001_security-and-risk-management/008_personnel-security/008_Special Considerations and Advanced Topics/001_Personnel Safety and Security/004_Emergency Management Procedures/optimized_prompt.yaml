active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss how personnel safety intersects with cybersecurity incidents, using real-world examples like
    ransomware affecting hospital OT systems or a DDoS attack escalating to physical threats in an ICS environment. Debate
    whether physical evacuation procedures should be integrated into cyber incident response plans, and justify your position
    with references to NIST CSF 2.0 and FEMA guidelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Distractors must be plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse 'event' with 'incident', mix NIST CSF functions,
      overlook personnel safety in cyber plans).
    - '1 distractor: Too broad/vague (e.g., general IT response ignoring OT).'
    - '1 distractor: Opposite/incorrect phase (e.g., ''Recovery'' instead of ''Containment'').'
    - '1 distractor: Real but unrelated concept (e.g., FEMA weather emergency vs. cyber).'
    - Ensure 60-70% difficulty; vary across Bloom's levels.
