active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given the CPRA's removal of employee data exemptions (effective 2023), debate whether employers should
    treat employee PI the same as consumer PI. Consider pros (e.g., unified processes, enhanced trust), cons (e.g., operational
    complexity, talent retention risks), ethics, and potential business impacts like litigation or breach risk reduction.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
