active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare CRL and OCSP for PIV credential revocation. What are the trade-offs in terms of speed, security,
    and scalability? Debate when to use each in personnel offboarding scenarios, addressing misconceptions about real-time
    revocation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on ''Smart Card and PIV Credential
  Revocation'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Personnel Security > Personnel Termination
  and Offboarding > Credential and Authentication Management > Smart Card and PIV Credential Revocation).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use elements like discussion on CRL/OCSP trade-offs, peer teach-back flowcharts, lost PIV scenarios as
  hints/examples.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [PASTE FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM ABOVE].

  - Research Context: Smart Cards (chip-based), PIV (federal MFA standard), DPC (mobile-derived), Revocation (invalidate via
  CA), CRL (periodic list), OCSP (real-time), NIST SP 800-157 (PIV lifecycle, revocation steps: report>CA revoke>update CRL/OCSP>verify).

  - Best Practices: Immediate suspension, <24h revocation, multi-channel notifications.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly [PASTE FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Output as JSON array of objects, each with ''type'', ''front'',
  ''back'' (nested as specified). Ensure distractors are realistic/misconception-based. Balance: 30% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND,
  30% APPLY/ANALYZE, 40% EVALUATE/CREATE. Make engaging for personnel security/offboarding focus.'
