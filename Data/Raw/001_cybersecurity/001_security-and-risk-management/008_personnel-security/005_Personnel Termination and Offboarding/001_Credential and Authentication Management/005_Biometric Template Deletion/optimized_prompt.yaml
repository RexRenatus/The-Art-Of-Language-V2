  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Biometric template deletion is just as straightforward
    as deleting a password.'' Use examples from NIST SP 800-63 and ISO/IEC 24745 to support your arguments, considering risks
    in personnel termination scenarios.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    logs). Ensure distractors are realistic from research context.'

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full list above].

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste full layers above].

  - Active Learning: Tie cards to discussion/activities where relevant.

  - Prior Knowledge: Link to passwords vs biometrics, offboarding.

  - Standards: NIST SP 800-63 series (authenticator lifecycle), ISO/IEC 24745:2011 (full: template protection, secure storage,
  revocation/deletion), NIST SP 800-88/800-122, GDPR Art. 17.

  - Concept Map: Central ''Deletion'' → branches: Definitions, Standards, Steps, Risks.


  Use Flashcard Schema: [paste full schema above]. Output ONLY in JSON array: [{''front'': ''question'', ''back'': ''answer
  + explanation'', ''type'': ''mc/cloze/sa'', ''blooms_level'': ''Remember'', ''layer'': 1, ''objective_id'': 1}]. Ensure
  spaced repetition friendly: varied difficulty, active recall. Distractors per protocol. No fluff.'
