active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the consequences of role ambiguity in cybersecurity (e.g., overlapping
    AO and Senior Management duties). Use NIST RMF examples to argue how clear assignments prevent risk escalation, and propose
    solutions like RACI matrices. Reference prior knowledge from project management hierarchies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
