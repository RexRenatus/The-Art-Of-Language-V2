active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the tension between employee privacy rights and organizational security
    needs in self-reporting obligations. Use real-world examples from insider threat cases (e.g., Edward Snowden) to argue
    for or against mandatory reporting of personal financial distress. Synthesize group consensus on best practices.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Edge case confusion (e.g., wrong timeline like 30 days), 3) Related but incorrect concept (e.g., SEC Form 8-K instead
    of personnel hotline). Ensure distractors are plausible to high-performers but reveal gaps in understanding.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Personnel Security under
  the topic ''Self-Reporting Obligations'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Personnel Security >
  During Employment Security > Continuous Monitoring and Compliance). Focus strictly on personnel self-reporting (e.g., adverse
  info like foreign contacts, cyber incidents) per NISPOM, SEAD 4, DoD 5220.22-M—NOT SEC corporate disclosures.
