active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In an era of increasing privacy concerns, debate the optimal frequency and scope of periodic rescreening
    for cybersecurity roles. Should it be annual for all employees, or risk-based? Consider costs, ethics, NIST CSF guidelines,
    and real-world trade-offs like negligent retention lawsuits.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Personnel Security under\
  \ NIST-aligned frameworks. Topic: 'Periodic Rescreening Requirements' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management\
  \ > Personnel Security > During Employment Security > Continuous Monitoring and Compliance). Voter consensus: 82.9% approval\
  \ on pedagogy/completeness.\n\nGenerate 25 high-quality flashcards optimized for spaced repetition and Bloom's Taxonomy.\
  \ Cover all learning objectives evenly (4-6 per level: REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, APPLY/ANALYZE, EVALUATE/CREATE). Distribute\
  \ across 4 scaffolding layers (Layer 1: Foundation, Layer 2: Components, Layer 3: Implementation, Layer 4: Integration).\
  \ Incorporate active learning hooks (e.g., scenario-based Qs from problem-solving exercise).\n\nUse this research context:\
  \ Periodic rescreening re-evaluates dynamic backgrounds (criminal, driving, licenses) to mitigate negligent retention. Differs\
  \ from continuous monitoring (real-time). Frameworks: NIST CSF 2.0 (Govern/Identify), NIST 800-53 PS family, CMMC (via 800-171),\
  \ HITRUST, ISO 27001 A.7. Prioritize risk-based frequency, automation.\n\nFlashcard Format (JSON array):\n[\n  {\n    \"\
  front\": \"Question text (MCQ: A) Opt1 B) Opt2 etc.)\",\n    \"back\": \"**Correct: A**\\nExplanation: [Justify with def/evidence].\

  \ Measurable verbs. No spoilers on front. Promote active recall."
