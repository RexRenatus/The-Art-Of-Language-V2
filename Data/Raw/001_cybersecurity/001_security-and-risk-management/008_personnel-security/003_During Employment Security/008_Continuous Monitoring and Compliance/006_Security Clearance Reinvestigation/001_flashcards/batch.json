        "core_logic": "Need-to-know is essential because it ensures that access to classified information is limited to those who require it for their job functions, thereby minimizing potential exposure and risk, even for cleared individuals. This functions by imposing a secondary layer of control beyond just eligibility, connecting to the principle of least privilege in information security.",
