active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Rank the top cybersecurity threats during international travel (e.g., public WiFi phishing, device theft,
    state-sponsored surveillance) and debate mitigation priorities using ISO 31030 principles. Consider geopolitical factors
    like traveling to China (high surveillance risk) vs. Canada (low risk). Use think-pair-share to discuss misconceptions,
    such as 'Company insurance covers cyber losses during travel.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
