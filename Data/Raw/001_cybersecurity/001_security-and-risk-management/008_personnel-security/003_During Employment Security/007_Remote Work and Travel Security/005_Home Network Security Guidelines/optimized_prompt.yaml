  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Home networks are as secure as enterprise networks if
    basic best practices are followed.'' Use examples from CISA and NSA guidelines to support your arguments, considering
    remote work scenarios where company data is at risk.'
