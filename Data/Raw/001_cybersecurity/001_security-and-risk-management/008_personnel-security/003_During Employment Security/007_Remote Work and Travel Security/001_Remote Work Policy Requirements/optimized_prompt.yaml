  **Research Context (complete):** Remote Work Security: Safeguard data/systems remotely [timechamp.io]. Challenges: BYOD,
  unsecured networks, attack surface expansion [researchgate.net]. NIST SP 800-46 Rev 2: Guide for telework/remote access/BYOD
  (planning, VPN/secure channels, device mgmt, training) [nist.gov]. CMMC: DoD certification model (Levels 1-5 per NIST SP
  800-171: access control, remote monitoring for CUI) [dodcio.defense.gov]. Travel Security: VPN on public nets, encryption
  [nist.gov]. Best practices: MFA, DLP, policy enforcement. Sources: nist.gov/publications, dodcio.defense.gov/CMMC, researchgate.net/publication/remote-work-cyber-risks.


  **Concept Map:** Central: Remote Work Policy Requirements → NIST SP 800-46, CMMC/NIST 800-171, Attack Surface (BYOD/home
  nets), Travel Security (hotspots), Risks (SolarWinds).
