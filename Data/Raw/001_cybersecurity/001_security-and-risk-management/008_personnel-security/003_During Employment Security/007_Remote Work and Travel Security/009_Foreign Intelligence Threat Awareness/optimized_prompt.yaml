  discussion_prompt: In a world of gray zone conflicts, where do economic espionage and cyber operations by foreign corporations
    blur the line between legitimate business competition and intelligence threats? Debate with examples from supply chain
    risks like Huawei or SolarWinds, considering remote work vulnerabilities. This sparks critical thinking on misconceptions
    that threats are only traditional spying.
  peer_teaching: Pair students; one explains core concepts (FIE, CI, Insider Threat) using non-examples (e.g., internal mistake
    vs. co-opted insider), the other teaches back with a remote travel scenario. Switch roles. Addresses misconceptions about
    threat scope.
  problem_solving: 'Present real-world scenario: ''During remote work from a hotel abroad, you receive an unsolicited LinkedIn
    connection from a foreign counterpart offering collaboration on a project. Outline step-by-step risk assessment, mitigation
    (e.g., VPN use, reporting), and decision-making using CI best practices.'''

  Generate high-quality flashcards using university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (objectives: 1. REMEMBER: Define FIE/CI/Insider;
  2. UNDERSTAND: Explain threat landscape (cyber espionage, elicitation, supply chain e.g., Huawei/SolarWinds); 3. APPLY:
  Identify risks in remote/travel; 4. ANALYZE: Compare tactics; 5. EVALUATE: Assess insiders; 6. CREATE: Design plans), active
  learning (support discussion on gray-zone economic espionage, peer teaching with non-examples/scenarios, problem-solving
  like LinkedIn abroad), scaffolding layers (Layer1: Foundation defs building on insider basics; Layer2: Components/FIE methods/evolving
  landscape; Layer3: Implementation steps; Layer4: CI integration/simulations).


  Ground in research: FIE (foreign entities acquiring info, per dni.gov); CI (vs espionage); Insider (exploited access). Examples:
  Cyber ops, elicitation in travel, remote vulns.


  Output EXACTLY a JSON array of 25-35 flashcards per schema: [{''front'':''...'', ''back'':''...'', ''type'':''...'', ''blooms_level'':''...'',
  ''scaffolding_layer'':''...'', ''source'':''...''}]. Ensure distractors plausible (misconceptions: govt-only FIE, intentional-only
  insiders). Balance coverage. Promote active learning/recall.'
