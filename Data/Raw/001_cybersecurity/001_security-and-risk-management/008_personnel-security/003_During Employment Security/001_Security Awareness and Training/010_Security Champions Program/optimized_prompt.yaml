active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the pros and cons of implementing a Security Champions program versus a purely centralized security
    model. Use OWASP Security Champions Guide examples to argue how decentralization fosters a security-first culture while
    addressing potential challenges like inconsistent expertise.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Distractors must be plausible but incorrect: e.g., for ''Security Champion definition'', distractors
    like ''Full-time security expert'', ''Central security team member'', ''Optional volunteer with no training''. Draw from
    misconceptions (Champions replace experts, decentralization means no central team), partial truths, or industry pitfalls
    (e.g., poor selection leading to ineffective programs). Ensure they test deeper understanding.'

  **Topic Knowledge Base (Synthesized from OWASP, AWS, Voter Consensus):**

  - **Core Concepts**: Security Champion: Non-security team member (e.g., dev, product) trained as advocate/liaison to central
  security team. Decentralizes security for early integration, builds security-first culture. Not experts, but motivated promoters.

  - **Best Practices & Guidelines** (Completed from OWASP Security Champions Guide, AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar):
  1) Gain executive buy-in via ROI demos (e.g., reduced breaches). 2) Select champions: Motivated, influential, part-time
  commitment (criteria: security interest, team respect; avoid overworked). 3) Training: Structured (OWASP modules on AppSec,
  threat modeling; initial bootcamp + ongoing). 4) Engagement: Regular meetings, Slack channels, workshops, hackathons, gamification.
  5) Communication: Bi-weekly syncs, shared dashboards. 6) Metrics: Training completion (target 90%), security champions per
  team (1:10 ratio), vuln reports (+50%), incidents (-30%), surveys (culture score).

  - **Sources**: OWASP Security Champions Guide (https://owasp.org/www-project-security-champions-guide/), AWS Well-Architected
  Framework: Security Pillar (https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/), NIST SP 800-50 IT Security Awareness.


  **Learning Objectives** (Cover all in flashcards): [Insert the ''learning_objectives'' array here].

  **Scaffolding Layers** (Distribute flashcards evenly): [Insert the ''scaffolding'' object here].

  **Active Learning Integration**: Flashcards should prompt higher-order thinking (e.g., ''Apply: In scenario X, select champions'';
  explanations link to activities like debates).


  **Generation Instructions**:

  - Create 30 flashcards: Balanced (5-8 per layer, 1+ per objective/Bloom level).

  - Varied types: 40% cloze, 40% MCQ (4 options), 20% short answer.

  - Optimize for Anki/Spaced Repetition: Active recall, no hints on front.

  - Ensure completeness: Include best practices, pros/cons (decentralized: scalable, cultural shift; cons: training overhead),
  DevSecOps links.

  - Use Flashcard Schema exactly: [Insert the ''flashcard_schema'' object here].


  Output ONLY a valid JSON array of 30 flashcard objects. No intro, no markdown.'
