active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In resource-constrained environments like small organizations, debate the trade-offs between implementing
    strict Segregation of Duties (SoD) and maintaining operational efficiency. Provide real-world examples (e.g., ERP systems
    like SAP) and propose compromises, addressing misconceptions that SoD is only for large firms.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''SoD only for finance''
    vs. all sensitive processes), 2) Partial truth (e.g., ''Single approver OK with monitoring'' ignoring full risks), 3)
    Inverse concept (e.g., ''Combine duties for efficiency'' vs. segregate). Base on voter suggestions, research (NIST toxic
    combos), and real-world (ERP violations). Ensure distractors test Bloom''s level.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Segregation of Duties
  (SoD) Matrix'' in the hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Personnel Security > During Employment Security
  > Separation of Duties > SoD Matrix.


  Incorporate these learning objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE].


  Embed active learning: Reference discussion on small-org trade-offs, peer teaching on matrices/toxic combos, problem-solving
  for IT procurement.


  Use 4-layer scaffolding: [INSERT scaffolding ARRAY HERE].


  Output 25 flashcards in JSON array, each matching this schema: {type: ''QA'' or ''MCQ'', front: string, back: string, explanation:
