  **Full Topic Content (Complete and Research-Grounded):**

  Privileged account monitoring oversees accounts with elevated permissions (access to sensitive data/systems). Core concepts:
  Privileged Account (elevated perms); PAM (lifecycle control/monitoring); Monitoring (track logins/commands/file access);
  Least Privilege (minimal access); Separation of Duties (divide functions).

  Types: Local Admin (machine-level); Domain Admin (domain-wide); Active Directory/Domain Service Accounts (service/app auth
  to AD, e.g., MSAs/gMSAs with persistent perms, no interactive logons, high abuse risk); Service Accounts (automation); Emergency
  Accounts (break-glass).

  Implementation: Audit logs, session recording, just-in-time access, tools (CyberArk, Microsoft PIM).

  Integration: Zero trust, insider threats (e.g., Colonial Pipeline via compromised creds).

  Prior Knowledge: Access control (RBAC), authentication, least privilege.

  Sources: NIST SP 800-53 (AC-6), CIS Controls v8 (Control 6), Microsoft Docs (PIM/MSAs), SANS ''Privileged Account Management'',
  BeyondTrust/CyberArk whitepapers.


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [insert the 6 objectives from above]. Cover all in flashcards.

  - Active Learning: Inspire questions from discussion (feasibility of least privilege), peer teaching (types/risks), problem-solving
  (log analysis), role-play (threats).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards: Layer 1 (5 cards, foundation), Layer 2 (5, types), Layer 3 (5-10, implementation),
  Layer 4 (5, integration).


  **Output Exactly 25 Flashcards as JSON Array.** Use the precise schema: {question, answer, bloom_level, distractors: [{option,
  why_wrong}, x3], explanation, topic_hierarchy_reference (e.g., ''Level 6: Privileged Account Monitoring''), references}.
  Ensure distractors are plausible/educational. Balance Bloom levels. Questions scaffold from recall to creation. No duplicates;
  vary formats (MCQ, cloze, short answer adapted to MCQ).'
