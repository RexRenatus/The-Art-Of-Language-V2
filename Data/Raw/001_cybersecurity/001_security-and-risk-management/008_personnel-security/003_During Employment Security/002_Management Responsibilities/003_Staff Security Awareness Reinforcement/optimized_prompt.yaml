active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how ongoing staff security awareness reinforcement addresses human risks
    (e.g., phishing, social engineering) in the context of the Defense-in-Depth People pillar. Use Verizon DBIR data (74%
    breaches from human error) and NIST SP 800-50 to support arguments on why management responsibilities are critical for
    compliance (GDPR, HIPAA). Identify prerequisites like basic threat knowledge and propose one improvement.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
