  Use this content for generation:

  [Insert full scaffolding layers here, including definitions, standards (NIST SSDF SP 800-218 PR.6.1-6.3, CSF 2.0 GV.SC full
  link: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.29.pdf), examples (SolarWinds, XZ Utils, Log4Shell), prior knowledge
  (SDLC/CI/CD)].


  Learning Objectives: [Insert all 6 objectives].

  Active Learning: [Insert components for contextual links].


  Generate 75 high-quality flashcards balanced across Bloom''s Taxonomy (per objectives) and scaffolding layers. 40% basic
  Q&A, 40% MCQ (with distractors per protocol), 20% scenario/application.


  Output ONLY in JSON array of objects:

  [{ "type": "MCQ|Q&A|Scenario", "front": "...", "back": { "answer": "...", "explanation": "... (cite sources, link to objectives/layers)",
  "blooms_level": "...", "layer": 1-4, "distractors_applied": ["if MCQ"] } }]


  Ensure: Measurable, active recall, no hints on front, explanations scaffold learning, distractors follow exact protocol
  (partial truths, misconceptions from attacks, opposites). Voter consensus: 100% approval on pedagogy/completeness.'
