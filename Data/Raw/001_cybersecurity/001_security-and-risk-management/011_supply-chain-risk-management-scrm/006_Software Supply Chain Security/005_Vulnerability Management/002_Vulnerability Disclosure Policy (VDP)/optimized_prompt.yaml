  remember:
  - objective: Define key terminology
    verbs:
    - define
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the ethical implications of full disclosure versus coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD)
    using the real-world Log4Shell vulnerability as a case study. Consider factors like public safety, vendor preparedness,
    and stakeholder impacts that should influence an organization's disclosure policy.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
  additional_activities:
  - 'Role-playing: One student as a researcher submitting a VDP report, another as the company PSIRT handling it.'
  - 'Think-pair-share: Discuss common misconceptions (e.g., ''VDPs always pay bounties''; ''CVD is the same as full disclosure'').'
  - 'Case study: Compare successful VDPs (Google, Microsoft) vs. failures in supply chain attacks like SolarWinds.'

  distractor_protocol: 'Always generate exactly 3 distractors. Make them plausible (e.g., swap CVD/PSIRT terms, reference
    misconceptions like ''VDP requires bounties''). Each must have ''text'' and ''explanation'' fields. Ensure variety: one
    minor variation, one common misconception, one opposite concept.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Vulnerability Disclosure\
  \ Policy (VDP) within the topic hierarchy: ['Cybersecurity', 'Security And Risk Management', 'Supply Chain Risk Management\
  \ (SCRM)', 'Software Supply Chain Security', 'Vulnerability Management', 'Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP)']. Use university-style\
  \ pedagogy: Bloom's Taxonomy objectives, active learning, 4-layer scaffolding, and distractor-based assessments.\n\n**Key\
  \ Sources (use verbatim citations):** \n- NIST SP 800-216: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-216 (purpose/guidelines for\
  \ VDPs).\n- CERT Guide to CVD: https://certcc.github.io/CERT-Guide-to-CVD/ (CVD process, PSIRT roles).\n- CISA Coordination:\
  \ https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog.\n- Examples: Google VDP (https://bughunters.google.com/),\
  \ Microsoft VDP.\n\n**Big Picture:** VDPs enable proactive vulnerability management in software supply chains, reducing\
  \ SCRM risks like SolarWinds.\n**Prior Knowledge:** Builds on vulnerabilities, threat modeling, risk assessment.\n**Misconceptions:**\
  \ VDP ≠ bug bounty; CVD ≠ full disclosure.\n\n**Learning Objectives:** [Insert the full learning_objectives array here].\n\
  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the full scaffolding array here].\n**Active Learning Context:** Tie flashcards to activities\
  \ like Log4Shell debates for deeper engagement.\n\n**Task:** Generate 25 flashcards in JSON array format. Strictly follow\
  \ the flashcard_schema:\n- Each card: {question, answer, distractors: [{text, explanation}, ... (exactly 3)], explanation,\
  \ bloom_level, scaffolding_layer, topic_hierarchy}.\n- Balance: 4-5 cards per Bloom's level; cover all layers/objectives.\n\
  - Questions: Varied (MCQ, cloze, short answer). Distractors plausible per protocol.\n- Explanations: 2-4 sentences, cite\
  \ sources, link to objectives/activities.\n\nOutput ONLY the JSON array of flashcards, no additional text."
