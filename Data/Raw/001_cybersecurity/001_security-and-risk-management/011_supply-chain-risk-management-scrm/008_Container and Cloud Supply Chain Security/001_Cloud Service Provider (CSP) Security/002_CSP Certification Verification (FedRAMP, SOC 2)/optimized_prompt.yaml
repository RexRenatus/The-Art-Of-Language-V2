active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of relying solely on SOC 2 compliance versus requiring FedRAMP
    authorization for cloud services in a federal supply chain. Consider cost, rigor, and risk mitigation, citing specific
    Trust Services Principles or FedRAMP baselines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Use these LEARNING OBJECTIVES: [paste array].

  Distribute flashcards across Bloom''s levels (4-6 per level), scaffolding LAYERS [paste scaffolding], and ACTIVE LEARNING
  [reference activities for scenario cards].


  Follow FLASHCARD SCHEMA exactly: JSON array of objects with ''front'', ''back'' {answer, explanation, distractors (for MCQs)}.
  Ensure 40% MCQs with distractor protocol, 20% process steps, 20% comparisons, 20% scenarios. Cover formative assessments:
  2-3 MCQs per layer, 1 scenario, reflection ties.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, e.g., [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}}, ...]. Ensure comprehensive, misconception-proof,
  university-level pedagogy.'
