active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a zero-trust model, debate the trade-offs of using mTLS versus JWT for service-to-service authentication
    in a Kubernetes service mesh. How does this impact supply chain risk management in containerized environments? (Encourage
    critical thinking by requiring evidence from NIST SP 800-204A and real-world breach examples like lateral movement in
    SolarWinds).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate this research context: Service Mesh is an infrastructure layer for microservices communication (traffic management,
  observability, security via proxies). Key: Data Plane (traffic handling, e.g., Envoy), Control Plane (configuration). Security:
  Zero Trust, mTLS (mutual auth), ABAC (attribute-based), JWT (RFC 7519). NIST SP 800-204A (secure microservices with service-mesh
  proxies); NIST SP 800-233 (SCRM for supply chains). Best practices: Cert rotation, sidecar injection. Misconceptions: Data/control
  confusion, mTLS=TLS.


  Use these exact learning objectives [insert learning_objectives array here]. Structure content via scaffolding layers [insert
  scaffolding array here].


  Generate flashcards following this schema exactly [insert flashcard_schema.structure here]. Protocol: [insert flashcard_schema.generation_protocol
  here].


  Enhance with active learning ties (e.g., reference discussion on mTLS trade-offs). Prior knowledge: Link to Kubernetes pods/services
  and load balancers. Big picture: Secures container supply chains against runtime breaches.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcards, each as a parsable object. No other text.'
