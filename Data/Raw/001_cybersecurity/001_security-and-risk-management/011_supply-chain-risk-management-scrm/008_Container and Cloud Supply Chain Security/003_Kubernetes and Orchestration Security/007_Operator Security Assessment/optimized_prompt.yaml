  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: 'Pair up: Student A teaches Student B the Operator pattern (CRDs, Controllers, reconciliation loops) and
    supply chain risks (e.g., provenance from OperatorHub); Student B then quizzes A on assessment tools (Trivy, RBAC scanners)
    and frameworks (NIST CSF PR.AA, SLSA). Switch roles and provide feedback on clarity.'
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A team wants to deploy the Prometheus Operator from OperatorHub, but scans reveal unsigned images
    and excessive RBAC permissions. Outline a step-by-step assessment (source verification, static/dynamic analysis, policy
    enforcement) and propose mitigations (e.g., cosign signing, Kyverno policies). Present solutions and vote on the most
    robust.'

    human sysadmin); 2) Partial truth/over-simplification (e.g., name a tool but wrong use case); 3) Unrelated/similar concept

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Kubernetes and Orchestration
  Security under Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM). Topic: Operator Security Assessment (focus on Kubernetes Operators as
  software extensions, NOT human operators—align to hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > SCRM > Container
  and Cloud Supply Chain Security > Kubernetes and Orchestration Security > Operator Security Assessment).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste array above].

  - Active Learning: Use to inspire applied questions.

  - Scaffolding: Ensure even coverage (5-7 cards per layer 1-4).

  - Sources: Kubernetes Operator docs (operatorframework.io), CNCF Security Whitepaper, OperatorHub verification, NIST CSF
  2.0 PR.AA, SLSA framework, ISO 27001/31000, Sigstore/cosign, Trivy/Grype docs.


  Generate 24 flashcards (6 per scaffolding layer) spanning Bloom''s levels (2 Remember/Understand, 2 Apply/Analyze, 2 Evaluate/Create
  overall). Vary formats: 60% multiple-choice, 40% short-answer/cloze.


  Strictly follow Flashcard Schema:

  [ paste schema above ]


  Output as JSON array of objects, e.g., [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}, ''metadata'': {...}}, ...]. Ensure flashcards
  are precise, exam-ready (CISSP-style), with Kubernetes-specific examples (e.g., Prometheus Operator). No human Operator
  content.'
