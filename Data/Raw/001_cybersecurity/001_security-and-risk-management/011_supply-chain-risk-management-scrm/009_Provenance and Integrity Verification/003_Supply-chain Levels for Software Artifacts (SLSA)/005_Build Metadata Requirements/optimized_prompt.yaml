active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given recent supply chain attacks (e.g., SolarWinds, Log4Shell), debate which build metadata attributes
    (e.g., builder identity, input materials digests, signing key, recipe reproducibility) are essential for SLSA compliance
    at Levels 2-4, weighing security benefits against implementation costs in a CI/CD environment.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Supply Chain Risk Management
  (SCRM). Topic: ''Build Metadata Requirements'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > SCRM > Provenance
  and Integrity Verification > SLSA > Build Metadata Requirements). Focus on SLSA-specific requirements (in-toto Provenance:
  builder, recipe, materials, products, metadata; Levels 2-4) integrated with NIST SP 800-53 Rev5 AC-16(8) supply chain enhancements.
