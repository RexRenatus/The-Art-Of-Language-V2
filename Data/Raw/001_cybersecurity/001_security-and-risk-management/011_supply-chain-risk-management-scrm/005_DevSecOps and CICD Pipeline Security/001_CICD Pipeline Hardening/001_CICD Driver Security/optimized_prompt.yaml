  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using self-hosted CI/CD drivers (e.g., GitHub Actions
    self-hosted runners) versus managed cloud runners in terms of security, cost, and scalability. Reference OWASP Top 10
    CI/CD risks and NIST SP 800-204D to support your arguments, and vote on the best approach for a high-security environment.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., ''Use root privileges for simplicity'' instead of least privilege).'
    - 'Distractor 2: Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Immutable images are optional if scanned'').'
    - 'Distractor 3: Plausible but outdated/irrelevant (e.g., ''Rely solely on antivirus'' vs. SLSA).'
    - Ensure distractors are realistic, derived from real-world pitfalls (OWASP/CIS), and teach critical thinking when explained.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in CI/CD Driver Security (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) > DevSecOps and CI/CD Pipeline
  Security > CI/CD Pipeline Hardening > CI/CD Driver Security). CI/CD Driver refers to pipeline execution agents like Jenkins
  agents, GitLab runners, or GitHub Actions self-hosted runners.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema. Distribute across Bloom''s levels (4 REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND,
  8 APPLY/ANALYZE, 8 EVALUATE/CREATE, 5 mixed) and scaffolding layers (Layer 1: 6 cards, Layer 2: 6, Layer 3: 7, Layer 4:

  Research Context: CI/CD pipelines form the SSC backbone (NIST SP 800-204D). Key risks: OWASP Top 10 CI/CD (e.g., credential
  misuse, insufficient logging). Best practices: Immutable images, network isolation, SBOM, SLSA, CIS Controls 8.1-8.2. Prevents
  50%+ supply chain breaches.


  Output ONLY in JSON array of flashcards, each as: {''front'': ''Question'', ''options'': [''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D''], ''correct'':
  ''A'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''APPLY'', ''layer'': ''3'', ''reference'': ''NIST SP 800-204D''} or Q&A
  equivalent. Ensure pedagogical depth, voter-approved completeness (e.g., explicit definitions, comparisons), and no truncation.'
