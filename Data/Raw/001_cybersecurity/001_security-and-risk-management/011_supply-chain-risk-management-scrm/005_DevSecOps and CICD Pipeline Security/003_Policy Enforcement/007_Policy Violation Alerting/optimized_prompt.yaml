  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: 'Students pair up: Partner A explains types of policy violations in SCRM (e.g., unauthorized third-party
    components, misconfigurations), while Partner B teaches alerting mechanisms in CI/CD pipelines (e.g., integration with
    tools like Slack, SIEM). Switch roles after 5 minutes and summarize key takeaways as a group.'
  problem_solving: 'Simulate a CI/CD pipeline scenario: Given a pipeline incorporating a third-party package with an unsigned
    binary and open-source license violation, students must identify the violations, select appropriate detection tools (e.g.,
    policy-as-code scanners), and design an alerting workflow including escalation paths to SOC analysts.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Policy Violation Alerting
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) > DevSecOps and CI/CD
  Pipeline Security > Policy Enforcement > Policy Violation Alerting). Generate 25-35 high-quality flashcards that scaffold
  learning from foundation to integration, covering all Bloom''s Taxonomy levels via these objectives: [insert learning_objectives
  array here].


  Incorporate research context: Policy violations are deviations from security policies (e.g., unsigned packages, license
  issues); Alerting enables timely SOC response; Key frameworks: NIST CSF (Identify function, https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework),
  CIS Controls v8 (Controls 1,4,7,13; https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-list), ISO 27001. Prior knowledge:
  Security policies, SIEM tools.


  Structure content by 4 scaffolding layers: [insert scaffolding object here]. Draw from active learning for scenario depth:
  [insert active_learning object here].


  Use exact flashcard schema: [insert flashcard_schema object here]. Ensure even coverage (5-7 cards per Bloom''s level; 6-9
  per layer); 40% definition Q&A, 40% MC, 20% scenario. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as an object matching
  the schema. No additional text.'
