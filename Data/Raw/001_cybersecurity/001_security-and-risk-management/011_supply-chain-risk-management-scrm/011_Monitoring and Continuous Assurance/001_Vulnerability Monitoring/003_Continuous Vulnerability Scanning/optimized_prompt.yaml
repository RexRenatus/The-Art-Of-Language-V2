active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a supply chain with third-party vendors, how does continuous vulnerability scanning reduce the window
    of opportunity for attackers compared to periodic scans? Debate the trade-offs in resource allocation, false positives,
    and coverage of dynamic environments.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, students take turns explaining a specific CIS Control 3 sub-control (e.g., 3.1 Vulnerability Scanning
    vs. 3.2 Remediation Tracking) and teach it back with real-world examples, such as the Log4j vulnerability exploitation.
  problem_solving: Provide mock vulnerability scan reports from tools like OpenVAS or Nessus; students prioritize remediations
    using risk-rating (CIS 3.7), considering attack surface, business impact, and supply chain dependencies. Follow with think-pair-share
    to review decisions.

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema. Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives,
  active learning ties (e.g., reference discussion prompts in explanations), 4-layer scaffolding, and prior knowledge links.


  **Contextual Knowledge:**

  - Definitions: Vulnerability, CVM (continuous ID/assess/remediate), attack surface, window of opportunity.

  - Frameworks: CIS Controls v8 Control 3 (3.1-3.7: scanning, prioritization, patching, etc.); NIST SP 800-40.

  - Tools: Nessus, Qualys, OpenVAS.

  - Examples: SolarWinds (supply chain), Log4j (exploitation window).

  - Sources: CIS Controls (cisecurity.org/controls), Tenable Docs (docs.tenable.com), NIST (nvlpubs.nist.gov).
