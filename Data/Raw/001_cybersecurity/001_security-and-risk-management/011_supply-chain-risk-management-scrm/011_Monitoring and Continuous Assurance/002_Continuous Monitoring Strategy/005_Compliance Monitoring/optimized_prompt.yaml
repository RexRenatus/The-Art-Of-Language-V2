active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the balance between continuous monitoring costs and supply chain risk mitigation in SCRM. Using
    NIST CSF Tiers, argue for or against prioritizing Tier 4 (Adaptive) monitoring for all vendors, considering real-world
    trade-offs like budget constraints and emerging threats.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
