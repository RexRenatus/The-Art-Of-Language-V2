active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of relying solely on NIST SP 800-218 for developer security training verification
    versus integrating multiple frameworks like the NICE Framework and NIST SP 800-161r1. Provide evidence from real-world
    breaches (e.g., SolarWinds) where training gaps led to supply chain risks, and propose a hybrid approach.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
