      "correct_answer": "An SBOM provides a detailed inventory of all software components and their dependencies, enabling organizations to identify potential vulnerabilities and manage risks associated with third-party code.",
      "distractors": [
        {
          "text": "An SBOM is primarily used for licensing compliance and has no bearing on security.",

        {
          "text": "An SBOM automatically patches all identified vulnerabilities in the software.",

      ],
      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "SBOMs are critical because they provide transparency into the software supply chain, allowing organizations to understand the components they are using and their associated risks, since vulnerabilities can exist in any component. This transparency is essential for managing risks and ensuring Customer Security Outcome Ownership.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The correct answer accurately describes the function of an SBOM in providing transparency for risk management, which is key to Customer Security Outcome Ownership. Distractors misrepresent its purpose, capabilities, or applicability.",
        "analogy": "An SBOM is like an ingredient list for a pre-packaged meal; it tells you exactly what's inside, so you can check for allergens or ingredients you want to avoid, ensuring the meal meets your dietary needs (security outcomes)."

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "EO 14028 strengthens Customer Security Outcome Ownership by mandating specific security improvements, particularly in the software supply chain, because vulnerabilities in software can have widespread impacts. This works by establishing clear expectations for secure software development and acquisition, ensuring federal agencies are accountable for the security of their systems.",

      ],
      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "A lack of clear ownership creates a security gap because responsibilities are undefined, leading to critical security tasks being overlooked or neglected, since neither party assumes accountability. Therefore, this ambiguity significantly increases the risk of security incidents and data breaches.",
