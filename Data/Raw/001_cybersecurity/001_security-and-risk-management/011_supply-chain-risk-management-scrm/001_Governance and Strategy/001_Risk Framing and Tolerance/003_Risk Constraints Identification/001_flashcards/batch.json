        "core_logic": "NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2 emphasizes that trust in external providers requires verifiable evidence of control effectiveness. Independent assessments and validated certifications provide objective assurance, unlike marketing claims, internal reports, or mere contractual statements.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors propose weak or unverifiable forms of evidence (marketing, internal reports, simple clauses), failing to recognize the need for objective, independent validation of external provider controls.",
        "analogy": "Trusting an external provider's controls based on marketing is like trusting a chef's food safety based on their restaurant's flashy sign; you need to see health inspection reports or certifications for real assurance."
