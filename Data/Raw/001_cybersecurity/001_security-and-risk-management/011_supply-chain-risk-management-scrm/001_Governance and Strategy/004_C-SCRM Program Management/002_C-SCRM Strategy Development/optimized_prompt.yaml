active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given recent supply chain attacks like SolarWinds or Log4j, debate the most critical elements to include
    in a C-SCRM strategy and the trade-offs between comprehensive risk assessment and implementation speed. Support your position
    with NIST SP 800-161r1 references.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    principles:
    - Common misconceptions (e.g., confuse C-SCRM with general SCRM)
    - Partial truths (e.g., correct framework but wrong category)
    - Outdated info (e.g., pre-CSF 2.0 references)
    - Similar terms (e.g., ICT vs. IT; criticality vs. vulnerability)
    - Extreme positions (e.g., 'ignore suppliers' vs. 'assess all equally')
