active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of recent supply chain attacks like SolarWinds, debate whether every organization needs
    a dedicated C-SCRM PMO or if integrating it into existing risk management structures (e.g., NIST RMF) is sufficient. Support
    your position with references to NIST SP 800-161 and CSF 2.0 GV.SC category, considering resource constraints and prior
    cybersecurity governance knowledge.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
