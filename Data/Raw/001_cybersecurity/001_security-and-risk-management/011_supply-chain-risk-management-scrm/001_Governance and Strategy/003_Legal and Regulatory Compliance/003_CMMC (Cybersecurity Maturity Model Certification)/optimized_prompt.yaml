active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of self-assessment versus third-party C3PAO or DIBCAC assessments
    for CMMC Level 2 compliance in a mid-sized DIB supplier. Consider costs, reliability, supply chain impacts, and regulatory
    risks. Support arguments with references to NIST SP 800-171 and Federal Register guidance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM ABOVE, INCLUDING PRIOR KNOWLEDGE]

  - Research Context: CMMC 2.0 (DoD standard for DIB contractors protecting FCI/CUI). Levels: 1 (self-assess 17 FAR basics),
  2 (self/C3PAO assess 110 NIST 800-171), 3 (DIBCAC assess Level 2 + 24 NIST 800-172). Assessments: Self (annual), C3PAO (3-yr
  cert Level 2), DIBCAC (govt Level 3). Key diffs from 800-171: Adds maturity processes, verification. SSP/POA&M required.
  Federal Register codifies rules. SCRM integration: Contract flow-down.
