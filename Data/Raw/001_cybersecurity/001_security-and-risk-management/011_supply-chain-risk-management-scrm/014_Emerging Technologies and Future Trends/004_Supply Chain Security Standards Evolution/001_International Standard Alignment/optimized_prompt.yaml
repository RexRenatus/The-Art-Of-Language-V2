  Generate 75 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet using university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives [INSERT
  LEARNING OBJECTIVES HERE], active learning activities [INSERT ACTIVE LEARNING COMPONENTS HERE], and 4 scaffolding layers
  [INSERT SCAFFOLDING LAYERS HERE].


  Key content: HITRUST CSF (aligns with ISO 27001/27002), ISO/IEC 27001 (ISMS), ISO/IEC 27002 (controls, e.g., A.15 suppliers),
  NIST SP 800-161r1 (SCRM practices), ISO 28000 (supply chain security), ISO/IEC 27036 (supplier relationships), CMMC, NIST
  CSF 2.0 (GV.OC), CISA/ENISA guidelines, SBOM, tiered suppliers, SolarWinds case.


  Use [FLASHCARD GENERATION SCHEMA HERE] exactly. Balance types: 30% Basic Q&A, 50% MCQ (with distractor protocol), 20% Cloze.
  Ensure cards scaffold from foundation to integration, promote active recall, and tie to real-world SCRM evolution.
