active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the strengths and limitations of industry consortium initiatives (e.g.,
    OpenSSF vs. government-led efforts like CISA SCRM) in evolving supply chain security standards. Use specific examples
    like SLSA or SBOM to support arguments, and vote on the most promising initiative for future adoption.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    CSF with CIS Controls scope); (2) common misconceptions (e.g., SBOM only for open-source); (3) partially correct but incomplete
    (e.g., SLSA Level 1 as ''fully secure''). Ensure plausible for experts, derived from related concepts like ISO 27036 or
    CISA SCRM.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Supply Chain Risk Management
  (SCRM) and Supply Chain Security Standards Evolution. Topic Hierarchy: Level 1: Cybersecurity > Level 2: Security And Risk
  Management > Level 3: Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) > Level 4: Emerging Technologies and Future Trends > Level 5:
  Supply Chain Security Standards Evolution > Level 6: Industry Consortium Initiatives.


  Incorporate this research context: Industry consortiums (e.g., OpenSSF, SCORE, FS-ISAC, SSWG, CISA SCRM) drive standards
  like NIST CSF 2.0 (Govern function for supply chain), CIS Critical Security Controls (inventory, secure config), ISO/IEC
  27036 (supplier relationships), NTIA SBOM (SPDX/CycloneDX), SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts), SSDF. Key
  roles: collaboration on best practices, threat sharing, standards evolution post-SolarWinds/Log4j.
