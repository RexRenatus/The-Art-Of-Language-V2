  discussion_prompt: 'In small groups, debate the following: ''How does a failure in media accountability (e.g., poor chain-of-custody
    tracking) amplify supply chain risks compared to internal operational risks? Use NIST MP-6 (Media Sanitization) as a reference
    and cite potential impacts on PII/PHI confidentiality.'' Encourage critical thinking by requiring groups to propose one
    mitigation strategy per risk identified.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    with journalistic ethics); (2) Related but incorrect control (e.g., mix MP-6 with AU logging); (3) Supply chain red herring
    (e.g., vendor vetting without media-specific accountability). Ensure distractors are realistic errors from NIST contexts,
    avoiding randomness.'

  Protection (MP) family. Topic: ''Media Accountability'' under hierarchy Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Supply
  Chain Risk Management (SCRM) > Operational Security Controls > Media Protection (MP) > Media Accountability. Note: Focus
  strictly on physical/digital media protection (e.g., USBs, tapes: access, storage, sanitization, chain-of-custody tracking)—ignore
  journalistic ethics.
