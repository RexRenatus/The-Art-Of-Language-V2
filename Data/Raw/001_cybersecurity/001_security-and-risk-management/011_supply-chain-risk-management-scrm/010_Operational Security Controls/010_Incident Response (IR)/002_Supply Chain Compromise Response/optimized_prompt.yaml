  discussion_prompt: In the SolarWinds supply chain attack, the attackers compromised the build process. Debate whether organizations
    should prioritize vetting third-party code over monitoring their own networks, or vice versa. What trade-offs exist in
    terms of cost, effectiveness, and scalability? This sparks debate on prevention vs. detection.
  peer_teaching: Pair students; one explains NIST SP 800-161r1 C-SCRM lifecycle phases (e.g., risk assessment, monitoring),
    the other teaches back incident response steps from NIST SP 800-61r2 (preparation, detection, analysis, containment, eradication,
    recovery, lessons learned), then switch roles and quiz each other on prior knowledge connections like basic incident response.
  problem_solving: 'Present a scenario like the Log4Shell vulnerability in a vendor library. Students, in small groups, develop
    a step-by-step incident response plan: detect, contain, eradicate, recover, lessons learned. Include real-world elements
    like notifying affected customers, regulatory reporting, and integration with enterprise risk management.'

    Distractors must be plausible based on common misconceptions: e.g., mix up NIST publication numbers/phases (800-61 vs
    800-161), confuse prevention with response steps, swap SolarWinds/Log4j details, or use similar terms (SCRM vs SCRI).
    Ensure distractors test subtle understanding (e.g., wrong SDLC stage).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Supply Chain Compromise
  Response (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) > Operational
  Security Controls > Incident Response (IR) > Supply Chain Compromise Response). Use university-style pedagogy: Bloom''s
  Taxonomy, active learning, 4-layer scaffolding.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the full learning_objectives array here].


  **Active Learning Components:** Incorporate elements from discussion_prompt, peer_teaching, and problem_solving into flashcards
  (e.g., scenario-based cards referencing SolarWinds/Log4j, group exercise prompts).


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full scaffolding object here]. Ensure flashcards progress from Layer 1 foundations to Layer
  4 integration, with prior knowledge links to basic IR (NIST SP 800-61r2) and risk management.


  **Research Context:** Supply chain compromise exploits vulnerabilities in supply chain/SDLC. Key frameworks: NIST SP 800-161r1
  (C-SCRM lifecycle: risk assessment, monitoring), NIST SP 800-61r2 (IR phases: preparation, detection/analysis, containment/eradication/recovery,
  lessons learned), NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), ISO/IEC 27036 (supplier relationships). Examples: SolarWinds (build
  process compromise), Log4j/Log4Shell (vendor library). Sources: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-161r1.pdf,
  https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf.


  **Flashcard Generation:** Create 75 high-quality flashcards covering all objectives and layers. Follow exact flashcard_schema:
  JSON array of objects. 40% multiple_choice with distractor_protocol. Vary formats for active recall (cloze deletions, scenarios).
  Make explanations educational, tying to big picture (enterprise resilience) and measurable outcomes. Output ONLY a JSON
  array of flashcards, no additional text.'
