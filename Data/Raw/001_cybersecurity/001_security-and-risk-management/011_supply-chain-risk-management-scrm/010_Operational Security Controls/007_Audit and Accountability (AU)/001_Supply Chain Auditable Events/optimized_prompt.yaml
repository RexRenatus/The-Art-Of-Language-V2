  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Auditing supplier onboarding events is more critical
    than component delivery verification in software supply chains.'' Use examples from NIST SP 800-161r1 and real-world incidents
    (e.g., SolarWinds) to support your position and critically evaluate counterarguments.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - SCRM: Managing cybersecurity risks in supply chains (NIST SP 800-161r1: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/161/r1/upd1/final).

  - Auditable Events: Recorded actions like supplier onboarding, component verification, code integration, shipment anomalies
  (extend NIST 800-53 AU-2 to SCRM).
