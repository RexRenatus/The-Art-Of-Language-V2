  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the lessons from real-world incidents like the CrowdStrike outage: How
    did failures in ESP coordination contribute to widespread disruptions? What changes to SCRM practices would prevent similar
    issues in hybrid/cloud environments? Support arguments with NIST SP 800-161 and SP 800-53 references.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM JSON]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM JSON]

  - Scaffolding Layers: Use 4 layers progressively [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM JSON]. Ensure flashcards span layers.

  - Research Context: ESP (no direct control over controls); C-SCRM (NIST SP 800-161); NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 controls: SA-4,
  SA-9, SR-3/4/5/etc.; SLA, SDLC, Criticality Analysis. Sources: NIST SP 800-161r1 (Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management
  Practices), SP 800-53 Rev5, SP 800-30; complete lists as per voter consensus.

  - Voter Priorities: Completeness (full NIST controls, sources); Pedagogy (Bloom''s progression, exercises); Big Picture
  (enterprise SCRM, CrowdStrike-like scenarios).


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards following this exact schema for each:
