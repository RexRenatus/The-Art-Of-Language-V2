active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Technical controls alone are sufficient for SCRM; human
    training for logistics personnel is secondary.'' Use examples from SolarWinds or other supply chain breaches to support
    your position and connect to NIST SP 800-161 guidelines.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs: 1 common misconception (e.g., confuse SCRM with general RM), 1 overgeneralization
      (e.g., apply IT-only training to logistics), 1 partial truth (e.g., NIST framework but wrong version/edition).'
    - 'Base on real errors: e.g., SolarWinds distractor ignores human factors.'
    - Ensure distractors teach via negation (explanation why wrong).

  Incorporate this research context: [Insert full Research Context from provided summary, completed with NIST SP 800-161r1
  (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-161r1.pdf), NICE Framework (https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/nice-framework-resource-center),
  SolarWinds case, definitions of Logistics Personnel/SCRM/C-SCRM]. Emphasize voter consensus: pedagogy via Bloom''s, active
  learning (role-play/cases), 4-layer scaffolding, prerequisites from AT.


  Use these exact learning objectives: [paste learning_objectives array].

  Active learning integration: Ensure flashcards prompt recall for discussions/activities (e.g., SolarWinds analysis).

  Scaffolding: Distribute cards across layers (Layer 1: 20%, Layer 2: 25%, Layer 3: 30%, Layer 4: 25%).


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards per this schema: [paste flashcard_schema].

  Output ONLY in JSON array: [{''type'': ''MCQ/Cloze/etc.'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''references'': [...], ''layer'': ''1-4'', ''bloom_level'': ''REMEMBER'', ''related_objective'': ''#1''}}, ...].
  Ensure distractors follow protocol. Make educational, engaging, and precise for university-level learners.'
