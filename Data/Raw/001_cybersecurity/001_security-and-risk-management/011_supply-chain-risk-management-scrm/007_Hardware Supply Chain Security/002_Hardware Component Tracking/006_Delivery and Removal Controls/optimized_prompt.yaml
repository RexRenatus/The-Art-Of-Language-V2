active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a hardware supply chain breach similar to SolarWinds, debate whether physical destruction or cryptographic
    erasure is more effective for sanitizing compromised components (e.g., infected firmware on chips). Consider factors like
    cost, time, environmental impact, recoverability risks, and regulatory compliance with NIST SP 800-171.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''formatting sanitizes data''
    – no, only clears); 2) Partial truth/extreme (e.g., ''always destroy'' – ignores reuse/cost); 3) Unrelated/confused concept
    (e.g., mix with access control). Base on voter-noted errors like ''physical destruction always best'' or research gaps.'

  - **Learning Objectives** (span Bloom''s): [insert full learning_objectives array here]. Cover all levels.

  - **Scaffolding Layers**: Distribute flashcards: 6 Layer 1, 6 Layer 2, 7 Layer 3, 6 Layer 4. [insert full scaffolding array
  here].

  - **Active Learning Integration**: Include 3-5 cards tying to discussion (SolarWinds debate), peer teaching (NIST explanations),
  problem-solving (USB tracking process).

  - **Context**: Focus on hardware (USBs, chips, drives) in supply chains. Key standards: NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 3 (3.8.1-3.8.9
  media protection/sanitization/transport; 3.10.7 crypto for components), SP 800-88 (sanitization methods). Big picture: Prevents
  supply chain attacks via secure media handling. Prior knowledge: Physical security/access controls.


  **Output Format**: JSON array of flashcards. Each: {"type": "basic|cloze|mcq", "front": "...", "back": "Answer. Explanation:
  ... NIST ref: ... Bloom''s: ... Layer: ...", "objective_tied": "#1-6"}. Balance types: 8 basic, 8 cloze, 9 MCQ.
