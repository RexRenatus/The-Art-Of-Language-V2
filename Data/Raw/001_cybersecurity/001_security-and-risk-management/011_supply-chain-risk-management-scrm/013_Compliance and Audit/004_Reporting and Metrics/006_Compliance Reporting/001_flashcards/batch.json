      "question_text": "When assessing a supplier's cybersecurity risk for reporting purposes, what does NIST SP 800-161 Rev. 1 suggest organizations should consider regarding the supplier's own supply chain?",
      "correct_answer": "The supplier's practices for managing risks within their own supply chain (i.e., their sub-tier suppliers).",
      "distractors": [
        {
          "text": "Only the direct contractual relationship with the supplier.",
          "misconception": "Targets [limited view]: Ignores the extended risk introduced by the supplier's own dependencies."

        {
          "text": "The supplier's geographical location and political stability.",
          "misconception": "Targets [external factors over internal practices]: While relevant for some risks, it's not the primary C-SCRM focus on supplier's own risk management."

          "misconception": "Targets [insufficient depth]: General awareness is less critical than specific supply chain risk management practices."
        }
      ],
      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Assessing sub-tier supplier risks is crucial because risks can cascade through multiple layers of the supply chain, impacting the primary supplier and ultimately the organization. This functions by extending the risk assessment beyond the immediate vendor to understand the full chain of dependencies, connecting to the concept of 'third-party risk management'.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The correct answer correctly identifies the need to assess the supplier's own supply chain risks, reflecting the cascading nature of SCRM. Distractors focus only on the direct relationship, external factors, or superficial training, missing the deeper C-SCRM requirement.",
        "analogy": "It's like checking not just if your main contractor is reliable, but also if their subcontractors are reliable, to ensure the whole project is sound."

        "core_logic": "Clear metrics are beneficial because they offer quantifiable proof of security effectiveness, which is essential for demonstrating compliance and justifying security investments. They function by translating security activities into measurable outcomes, connecting operational security efforts to strategic business objectives and regulatory requirements.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The correct answer highlights the objective and measurable nature of metrics for demonstrating security posture. Distractors propose negative outcomes like increased audit complexity, subjective interpretation, or replacing controls, which are all incorrect.",
        "analogy": "Clear metrics are like using a thermometer to check a fever; they provide an objective measurement rather than just saying someone 'feels warm'."
