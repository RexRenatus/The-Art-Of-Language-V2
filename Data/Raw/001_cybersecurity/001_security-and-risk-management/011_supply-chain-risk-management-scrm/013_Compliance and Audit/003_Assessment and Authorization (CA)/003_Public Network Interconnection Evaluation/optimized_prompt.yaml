active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In small groups, debate whether standard ISAs and MOUs are sufficient for high-risk supply chain interconnections
    (e.g., connecting to a cloud provider with public networks) or if custom controls are always needed. Cite specific phases
    from NIST SP 800-47 Rev. 1 and real-world examples from SCRM breaches to support your position.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST frameworks. Generate
  25 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Public Network Interconnection Evaluation'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security
  And Risk Management > Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) > Compliance and Audit > Assessment and Authorization (CA) > Public
  Network Interconnection Evaluation). Focus on NIST SP 800-47 Rev. 1: Full lifecycle (Planning/Authorization: risk assess/ISA
  dev; Implementation: controls; Ops/Maint: monitor; Termination: decommission). Include system interconnection, info exchange,
  ISA/MOU, SCRM links, RMF CA integration.


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the 6 objectives above].

  - Scaffolding: Balance across 4 layers [paste scaffolding summaries].

  - Active Learning: Draw from discussion/peer teaching/problems for scenario cards.

  - Prior Knowledge: Assume basics (networking: firewalls/VPNs/OSI; risk mgmt; RMF).

  - Concept Map: Central ''Public Network Interconnection'' → NIST phases, risks, SCRM/compliance.


  Use exact Flashcard Schema: [paste schema details]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcards, each with ''front'' and ''back''
  object. Ensure measurable, active recall; distractors plausible. Sources: NIST SP 800-47 Rev. 1 (full: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-47r1.pdf),
