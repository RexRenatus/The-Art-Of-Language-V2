active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of supply chain risk management (SCRM), debate whether SOC 2 Type II reports provide sufficient
    assurance for third-party vendors or if additional frameworks like ISO 27001 are needed. Support arguments with pros/cons,
    real-world breach examples (e.g., SolarWinds supply chain attack), and implications for compliance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Type II is point-in-time''
    vs. correct period-based), 2) Similar term mix-up (e.g., confuse TSC with NIST controls), 3) Partial truth (e.g., list
    4/5 TSC). Ensure distractors test nuance without misleading; explain why incorrect in flashcard explanation.'

  **Research Context (Complete Summary):** SOC 2 Type II reports, from AICPA, assess service organization controls over 6-12
  months for design and operating effectiveness across five Trust Services Criteria (TSC): Security (mandatory: protect against
  unauthorized access), Availability (operational uptime), Processing Integrity (accurate/timely processing), Confidentiality
  (protect designated info), Privacy (per privacy notices/GAPP). Type I: point-in-time design only. Type II: includes effectiveness
  testing. Report sections: system description, management''s assertion, auditor''s opinion, detailed tests/exceptions. Best
  Practices: 1) Scope Definition (select TSCs); 2) Readiness Assessment (gap analysis); 3) Auditor Selection (experienced
  CPA); 4) Implement Controls/Evidence; 5) Audit/Testing; 6) Remediate Deficiencies; 7) Ongoing Monitoring. Pitfalls: Broad
  scope, weak evidence. Real-world: Essential for SaaS/cloud (e.g., AWS SOC 2); SolarWinds breach underscored SCRM gaps.
