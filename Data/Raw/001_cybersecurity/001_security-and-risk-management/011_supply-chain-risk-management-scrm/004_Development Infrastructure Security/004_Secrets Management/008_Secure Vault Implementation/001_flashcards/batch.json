        "core_logic": "Separation of Duties (SoD) is critical for secure vault implementation because it prevents a single point of failure or malicious action by ensuring that no single individual has complete control over sensitive operations (like approving secret access or changes), functioning by dividing critical tasks among multiple roles or individuals.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors confuse SoD with automated rotation, encryption, or network-based access controls, missing its core principle of dividing critical responsibilities to prevent abuse or error.",
        "analogy": "Separation of Duties is like requiring both a manager's signature and a finance department's approval for a large expense, ensuring no single person can authorize a significant financial transaction alone."
