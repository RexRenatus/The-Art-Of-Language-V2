  Incorporate this research context:

  - MFA requires 2+ factors: something you know (password/PIN), have (OTP token/hardware key/SMS), are (biometrics).

  - Key terms: Multi-Factor Authenticator (provides >1 factor), CSP (identity proofing), Verifier (verifies claimant using
  authenticators), RP (relying party).

  - NIST SP 800-63B-4: Digital Identity Guidelines; AAL1-3 levels; AAL3 requires phishing-resistant MFA (e.g., hardware crypto
  keys, no SMS); Verifier confirms identity without shared secrets.

  - SCM best practices: GitHub (org settings > Require 2FA), GitLab (admin > sign-in restrictions); enforce in SCRM to prevent
  supply chain attacks.

  - Sources: NIST SP 800-63B (https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html), GitHub Docs (https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/requiring-two-factor-authentication),
