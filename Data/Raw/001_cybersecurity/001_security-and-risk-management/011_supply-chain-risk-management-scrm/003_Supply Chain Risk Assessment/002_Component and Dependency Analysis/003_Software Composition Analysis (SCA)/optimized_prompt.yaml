active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, use a sample package.json to explain direct vs. transitive dependencies, then peer-teach the concept
    to another pair with a diagram.
  problem_solving: Analyze a provided codebase snapshot (e.g., dependency list with known vulns/licenses), identify risks,
    generate a mock SBOM, and propose remediation steps.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ (single best answer): 1 correct option, 3 distractors. Distractors must be plausible: e.g.,
    swap direct/transitive deps, confuse tools (Snyk scans runtime vs. build-time), common myths (SCA catches 0-days), or
    partial truths (SBOM only for OSS). Base on research context/misconceptions. Randomize option order.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Software Composition Analysis
  (SCA) within Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM). Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > SCRM >
  Supply Chain Risk Assessment > Component and Dependency Analysis > SCA.


  Research Context: SCA automates identification/management of OSS/third-party components for vulnerabilities (NVD), licenses,
  quality. Key: OSS, direct/transitive deps, SBOM. Tools: Snyk, Sonatype Nexus, Black Duck, WhiteSource. Cases: Log4Shell,
  SolarWinds. Standards: NIST SP 800-161r1, OWASP, NTIA SBOM. Sources: OWASP Dependency-Check (owasp.org), NIST EO 14028 (nist.gov),
  Snyk Docs (snyk.io), Sonatype (sonatype.com), NTIA SBOM (ntia.gov).
