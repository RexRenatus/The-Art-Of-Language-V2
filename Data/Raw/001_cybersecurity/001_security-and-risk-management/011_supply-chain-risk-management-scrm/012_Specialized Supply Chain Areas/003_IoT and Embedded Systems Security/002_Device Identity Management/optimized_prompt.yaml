learning_objectives:
  analyze:
  - objective: Compare NIST SP 800-63 standards (e.g., Rev 4 guidelines on identity proofing and authenticator management)
      for device vs. human identity, identifying IoT-specific adaptations.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  remember:
  - objective: 'Define key terms: device identity, device lifecycle management, authentication, authorization, and trust in
      the context of IoT devices.'
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  create:
  - objective: Design a device identity management plan for an IoT supply chain, integrating NIST SP 800-63B-4 authenticator
      lifecycle management with SCRM controls.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  understand:
  - objective: Explain the device lifecycle management process and its role in maintaining identity trust throughout procurement,
      operation, maintenance, and decommissioning.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Demonstrate authentication methods for IoT devices, such as using X.509 certificates or TPM-based keys, in
      a provisioning scenario.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  evaluate:
  - objective: Critique a given device's identity management strategy in a supply chain scenario, assessing risks like fake
      identities from compromises.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
active_learning:
