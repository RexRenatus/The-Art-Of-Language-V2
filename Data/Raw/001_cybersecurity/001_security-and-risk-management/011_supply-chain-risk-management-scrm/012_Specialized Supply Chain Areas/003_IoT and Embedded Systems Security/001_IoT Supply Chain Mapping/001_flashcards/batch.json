        "core_logic": "IoT devices often rely on complex, multi-tiered supply chains with international suppliers, making it difficult to gain visibility into all entities and processes. This opacity increases cybersecurity risks because potential vulnerabilities or malicious insertions can go undetected, therefore, managing these risks is challenging.",
