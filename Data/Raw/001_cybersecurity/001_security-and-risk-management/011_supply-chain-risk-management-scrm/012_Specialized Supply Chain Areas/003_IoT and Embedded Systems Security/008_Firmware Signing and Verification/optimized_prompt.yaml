active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the role of firmware signing in mitigating supply chain attacks (e.g.,
    SolarWinds firmware tampering or IoT botnets like Mirai). How does it contribute to overall SCRM, and what are potential
    limitations? Support with NIST/OCP references.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the full learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: Embed prompts/scenarios into flashcards (e.g., discussion-style Qs).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute across 4 layers + prior knowledge/sources [paste full scaffolding].

  - Prioritize: Misconceptions (no confidentiality), key mgmt risks, big picture (SolarWinds/IoT botnets), tools (OpenSSL).


  Generate exactly 25 flashcards in JSON array format: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''type'': ''...''}, ''metadata'': {''blooms_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''prerequisite'':
  ''...''}}, ...]. Follow flashcard_schema precisely: Varied types (MCQs w/ distractors, cloze, scenarios), balanced coverage,
  explanations tie to objectives/layers/sources. Ensure measurable action verbs, no criminal content, educational focus.'
