        "core_logic": "NIST SP 800-161 Rev. 1 defines information asymmetry in C-SCRM as the acquirer's lack of visibility into a supplier's internal processes for developing, integrating, and deploying technology. This imbalance hinders effective risk assessment because the acquirer cannot fully evaluate potential risks, since critical information about the supplier's operations is not transparent, because suppliers may not disclose all relevant details.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly suggest that information asymmetry relates to market trends, reverses the roles of information holder, or implies equal access, all of which misrepresent the core challenge of limited visibility into supplier processes.",
        "analogy": "It's like trying to buy a complex piece of software without seeing the source code or understanding the development process – the seller knows more about potential flaws than the buyer."
