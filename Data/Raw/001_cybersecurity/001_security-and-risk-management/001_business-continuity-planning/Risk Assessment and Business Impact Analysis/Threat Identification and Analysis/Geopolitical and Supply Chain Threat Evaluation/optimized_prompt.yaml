active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of recent events like the Russia-Ukraine war or US-China tech restrictions, debate how
    geopolitical risks to supply chains compare to traditional cyber risks in terms of likelihood, impact, and mitigation
    challenges. Provide evidence from NIST SP 800-161 or DNI guidelines to support your arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Voter Consensus: 84.3% approval (7 voters) on pedagogical enhancements.


  Incorporate these exactly:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the ''learning_objectives'' array here]

  - Active Learning: Weave in concepts from discussion (Russia-Ukraine/US-China), peer teaching (analogies, teach-back), problem-solving
  (Taiwan chips scenario, NIST SP 800-161).

  - Scaffolding: [paste the full ''scaffolding'' object here, including prior_knowledge and big_picture_context]. Use research
  context: SCRM (NIST), C-SCRM, ecosystem (NIST SP 1305), geopolitical risks (DNI); complete with criticality assessment (supplier
  impact eval), risk categories (cyber/enterprise/acquisition), sources (NIST SP 800-161).


  Follow this exact Flashcard Schema: [paste the full ''flashcard_schema'' object here].


  Best Practices: Use active recall (questions requiring reproduction); spaced repetition friendly (concise fronts); explanations
  promote deep understanding (link to Bloom''s, layers, standards, examples like SolarWinds). Ensure measurable, university-level
  pedagogy. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, no extra text.'
