        "core_logic": "NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2 defines risk tolerance as the degree of risk acceptable to an organization. In audit planning, understanding this tolerance is crucial because it helps set the benchmark for evaluating BCP effectiveness, guiding the audit to focus on areas where risks exceed acceptable levels.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly link risk tolerance to technology mandates, audit automation, or complete risk elimination, misrepresenting its purpose as defining acceptable risk levels that guide audit focus.",
        "analogy": "Risk tolerance in audit planning is like setting the acceptable blood pressure range for a patient; the doctor (auditor) knows what levels are concerning and needs further investigation based on this established range."
