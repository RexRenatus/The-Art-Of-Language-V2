learning_objectives:
  analyze:
  - objective: Compare the strengths and weaknesses of different evidence sources (e.g., original SIEM logs vs. management
      assertions) in assessing BCP control effectiveness.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  remember:
  - objective: 'Define key terms: audit evidence, sufficiency, appropriateness, relevance, and reliability in the context
      of cybersecurity audits (e.g., NIST SP 800-53A).'
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  create:
  - objective: Design an audit documentation template for cybersecurity controls, incorporating evidence collection procedures
      aligned with ISO 22301 or COBIT 2019.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  understand:
  - objective: Explain the relationship between relevance, reliability, sufficiency, and appropriateness of audit evidence,
      and their impact on evidence quality in business continuity planning (BCP) audits.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Demonstrate collecting and classifying audit evidence for a specific cybersecurity control, such as BCP test
      logs or incident response records.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  evaluate:
  - objective: Assess the sufficiency and appropriateness of provided evidence in a BCP audit scenario post-ransomware attack.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of a cybersecurity audit for business continuity planning, debate the trade-offs between
    sufficiency and appropriateness of audit evidence. Using a case study where only management assertions are provided for
    BCP effectiveness, argue what additional evidence (e.g., DR test logs, RTO/RPO metrics) is needed and why. This sparks
    critical thinking on misconceptions like equating quantity with quality.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Core content draws from NIST SP 800-53A (control assessments), ISO 22301 (BCP audits), COBIT 2019 (governance), with examples
  like BCP test logs, incident reports, SIEM data. Avoid PCAOB financial focus.


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning objectives (Bloom''s): [insert learning_objectives JSON here]

  - Active learning: Use discussion/peer-teaching/problem-solving to inspire card variety (e.g., scenario-based Qs for evaluation).

  - Scaffolding: Generate 5-7 cards per layer: [insert scaffolding_layers JSON here]

  - Concept map: Ensure cards cover central ''Audit Evidence'' → Sufficiency/Appropriateness → Documentation/Standards/Processes.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards progressing from remember (defs) to create (design tasks). Cover practical cyber examples
  (e.g., ransomware BCP audit evidence: logs for RTO).


  Output ONLY a valid JSON array of flashcards in exact schema: [{''question'': ''...'', ''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''... (cite NIST/ISO; include example)'', ''distractors'': [{''text'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''... (why wrong; cyber
  context)''} x3 ]}, ...]. Use snake_case keys. Ensure MCQ-style questions with 1 correct answer + 3 distractors. Explanations
  Bloom''s-aligned, active (e.g., ''Apply by...''). No intro/outro text.'
