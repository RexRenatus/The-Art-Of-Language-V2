  distractor_protocol: 'Distractors must be: 1) Semantically similar (e.g., swap NIST ''Detect'' with ''Protect''), 2) From
    real frameworks/sources (e.g., HITRUST vs. PCI DSS), 3) Reflect voter pitfalls (e.g., ''checkbox compliance'' vs. true
    readiness), 4) Progressive difficulty matching Bloom''s level.'

  **Research Context (Complete and Authoritative):** Regulatory examination readiness ensures organizations in regulated industries
  (e.g., healthcare, finance) demonstrate compliant, effective security/risk practices via documentation and controls. Core
  concepts: Regulatory Examination (formal agency review), Compliance (adherence to laws/standards), Readiness (prepared policies/evidence).
  Frameworks: HITRUST CSF (certifiable, harmonizes 60+ sources like ISO 27001, NIST, PCI DSS, GDPR; uses MyCSF for assessments).
  NIST CSF (functions: Identify risks, Protect assets, Detect anomalies, Respond to incidents, Recover operations; per https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework).
  NIST SP 800-53 (security controls; https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final). Others: COBIT (governance),
  CIS Controls (implementation groups), HIPAA (healthcare), SOX/FDIC (finance), ISO 27001 (certification). Cross-links: Applies
  to healthcare audits, financial exams, engineering certs. Sources: HITRUST (https://hitrustalliance.net/), NIST CSF (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework),
  NIST 800-53 (above), ISO 27001 (https://www.iso.org/standard/82875.html), PCI DSS (https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/),
  GDPR (https://gdpr.eu/).


  **Pedagogical Integration:** Use these Learning Objectives (Bloom''s progression): [insert full list from JSON]. Active
  Learning: Tie flashcards to discussion (''compliance checkbox?''), peer-teaching (framework quizzes), case study (Equifax
  breach improvements). Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers [insert full scaffolding descriptions].


  **Generation Instructions:** Create 40-50 high-quality flashcards following the exact Flashcard Schema [insert full schema].
  Ensure university-level rigor: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, distractors from real misconceptions. Balance
  Bloom''s levels. Output ONLY valid JSON array as specified in schema. No additional text.'
