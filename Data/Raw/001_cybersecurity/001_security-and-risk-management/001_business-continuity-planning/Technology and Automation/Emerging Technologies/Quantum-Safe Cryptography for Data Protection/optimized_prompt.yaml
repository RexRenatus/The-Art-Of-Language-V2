  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the urgency of transitioning to PQC today given the ''Harvest Now, Decrypt
    Later'' threat. Consider: How does this impact business continuity for data with 20+ year protection needs? Use real-world
    examples like healthcare records or financial archives.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

    - 'Base on voter-noted misconceptions (e.g., ''Symmetric crypto immune'' → distractor: ''AES-128 fully quantum-safe'').'
    - 'Partial truths (e.g., correct family but wrong standard: ''FIPS 204 is Kyber'').'
    - Common errors (e.g., 'Shor's breaks symmetric'; outdated standards).
    - Plausible alternatives (e.g., other PQC candidates like Falcon).
    - '3 distractors per MCQ: 1 misconception, 1 partial, 1 unrelated.'

  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [INSERT ARRAY ABOVE]

  - Active learning: [INSERT DETAILS ABOVE] (link cards to these).

  - Scaffolding: [INSERT LAYERS ABOVE] (tag cards by layer; progress from Layer 1 foundations to Layer 4 integration).

  - Prior knowledge: Assumes RSA/ECC/AES basics, Shor''s algorithm.

  - Completeness: NIST standards - FIPS 203 (ML-KEM/Kyber: KEM), FIPS 204 (ML-DSA/Dilithium: signatures), FIPS 205 (SLH-DSA/Sphincs+:
  signatures). Families: lattice, hash, code-based. Tools: liboqs, OpenQuantumSafe. Threats: Shor (asymmetric), Grover (symmetric-double
  keys). BCP ties: long-term data, hybrid schemes.

  - Misconceptions for distractors: Symmetric fully safe, PQC unnecessary now.
