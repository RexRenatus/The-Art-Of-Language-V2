  Incorporate this research context: Serverless computing abstracts infrastructure (cloudsecurityalliance.org); scalability
  auto-scales on demand; shared responsibility model (AWS docs); best practices from AWS Well-Architected Serverless Lens/Security
  Pillar, CSA 12 Critical Risks (e.g., IAM least privilege, event validation, monitoring, secure coding). Sources: cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/topics/serverless,
  aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar.


  Use these learning objectives [insert learning_objectives array]. Structure content in scaffolding layers [insert scaffolding_layers
  array].


  Generate flashcards using this schema [insert flashcard_generation_schema]. Ensure active learning ties: reference discussion/peer
  teaching/problem-solving in higher-level cards.


  Output ONLY a numbered list of flashcards in the exact formats specified. No introductions. Make content complete, accurate,
  and optimized for spaced repetition (concise fronts, detailed backs).'
