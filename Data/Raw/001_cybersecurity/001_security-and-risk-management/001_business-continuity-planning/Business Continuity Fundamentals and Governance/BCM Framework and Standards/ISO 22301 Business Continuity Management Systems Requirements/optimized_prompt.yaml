active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the role of ISO 22301 in mitigating cyber-attack disruptions versus natural
    disasters. Use real-world examples (e.g., ransomware attacks) to argue which disruptive incidents pose the greatest challenge
    to organizational resilience and why BCMS is essential.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
