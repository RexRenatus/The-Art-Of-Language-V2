active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the most common psychological impacts on cybersecurity incident response
    teams during a major ransomware attack (e.g., stress, burnout, PTSD). Propose how post-incident support services could
    mitigate these, referencing NIST SP 800-61's Post-Incident Activity phase, and evaluate potential barriers to implementation
    in a real organization.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Completed Research Context (Voter-Approved Expansion):** Core Concepts: Cybersecurity Incident (threat to CIA; NIST);
  Incident Response (mitigation; NIST SP 800-61r2/3); Post-Incident Analysis (lessons learned, root cause; Sygnia); Psych
  Impacts (stress, burnout, PTSD; emerging research); Support Services (counseling, PFA, EAP for responders). Standards: NIST
  SP 800-61 Rev. 2/3 (full: Post-Incident Activity includes lessons learned meetings to review processes, now expanded in
  Rev. 3 draft to address human factors like fatigue/psych support); NIST CSF (Respond/Recover); ISO 22301 (BCP resilience).
  Best Practices: Integrate in Recovery phase. Sources: NIST SP 800-61r2 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf);
  NIST CSF (nist.gov/cyberframework); CISA Incident Response (cisa.gov); SANS Responder Mental Health (sans.org).
