active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of implementing immutable backups (e.g., cost, accessibility,
    compliance) versus relying on traditional backups in a high-ransomware-threat environment. Use real-world examples like
    the Colonial Pipeline attack to support arguments and propose hybrid solutions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ flashcards (50% of total): Generate 3 distractors based on:

    - Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Immutability means data is encrypted'' vs. unchangeable).

    - Partial truths (e.g., ''Allows deletion after 24 hours'' for retention policies).

    - Opposites/plausible errors (e.g., ''Write Many Read Once'' vs. WORM).

    - Research-grounded pitfalls (e.g., confusing air gap with network segmentation).

    Ensure one correct answer, randomized position. Distractors promote active error correction.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, following university-level
  pedagogy (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Immutable Backup
  Storage for Ransomware Protection'' in the hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Business Continuity
  Planning > Continuity and Recovery Strategies > Backup Technologies and Media > Immutable Backup Storage for Ransomware
  Protection.


  Incorporate research context: Immutable backups protect against ransomware by making data unchangeable (immutability) via
  WORM storage, object locking (e.g., AWS S3), air-gapping, and chain-free independent snapshots. Key terms: immutability
  (unchangeable data), ransomware (encrypts/locks for ransom), WORM (write once, read many), air gap (isolated backups), object
  locking (retention policies).


  Use these EXACT learning objectives: [insert array from learning_objectives].

  Align to scaffolding layers: [insert array from scaffolding].

  Include active learning ties in explanations (e.g., ''Discuss in peer teaching: ...'').


  Follow this EXACT flashcard schema: [insert full flashcard_schema details].


  Output ONLY a valid JSON array of flashcards, no additional text. Ensure 40-60 cards, balanced across layers/Bloom''s, optimized
  for spaced repetition (concise fronts, rich backs/explanations). Voter suggestions: Emphasize error-prone concepts like
  retention compliance.'
