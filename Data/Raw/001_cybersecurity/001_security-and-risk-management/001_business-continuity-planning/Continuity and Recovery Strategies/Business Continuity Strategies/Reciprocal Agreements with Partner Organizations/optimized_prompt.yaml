active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the following: ''Are reciprocal agreements more beneficial than independent
    BCP solutions in a highly interconnected cybersecurity ecosystem? Support your position with examples from real-world
    incidents (e.g., ransomware attacks disrupting multiple organizations) and consider factors like trust, data sharing risks,
    and regulatory compliance.'' Encourage participants to reference NIST guidelines and challenge peers'' assumptions.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, aligned with university pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for the topic: ''Reciprocal
  Agreements with Partner Organizations'' (Topic Hierarchy: Level 1: Cybersecurity > Level 2: Security And Risk Management
  > Level 3: Business Continuity Planning > Level 4: Continuity and Recovery Strategies > Level 5: Business Continuity Strategies
  > Level 6: Reciprocal Agreements with Partner Organizations). Base content on provided research: reciprocal agreements as
  formal/informal pacts for mutual security recognition, resource sharing (threat intel, incident response), info sharing,
  mutual recognition; key in cybersecurity ecosystem; standards like NIST SP 800-34.


  Incorporate these LEARNING OBJECTIVES: [insert full array from JSON]. Ensure coverage across Bloom''s levels.


  Integrate SCAFFOLDING LAYERS: Generate ~10 cards per layer, progressing from foundation to integration as defined. [insert
  full scaffolding from JSON].


  Include ACTIVE LEARNING TIES: Weave in elements for discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving (e.g., scenario cards prompting
  debate or analysis).


  Follow FLASHCARD SCHEMA exactly: [insert full schema from JSON]. Output in JSON array: [{''front'': ''question'', ''back'':
  ''answer|explanation|Blooms|layer|source'', ''type'': ''mcq/cloze/etc.''}]. Ensure web-grounded accuracy, no fabrication,
