  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of enforcing strict BCM contractual requirements (e.g.,
    mandatory annual audits and sub-4-hour RTO) on vendors: How do they enhance supply chain resilience versus potential cost
    increases and vendor reluctance? Use NIST SP 800-161 examples to support arguments.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    SP 800-161 (C-SCRM) with unrelated standards like ISO 27001; Use similar but incorrect clauses (e.g., ''right-to-inform''
    vs. ''right-to-audit''); Draw from real-world errors (e.g., inadequate reporting timelines like ''annual'' instead of
    ''24 hours''). Ensure distractors teach by reinforcing why they''re wrong.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in CISSP-aligned topics. Generate
  high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized flashcards for the topic ''Contractual Requirements for Vendor BCM'' (Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Business Continuity Planning > Supply Chain and Third-Party Risk Management
  > Supply Chain Resilience Strategies > Contractual Requirements for Vendor BCM). Use the provided COMPLETE content below,
  integrating voter consensus (completeness on best practices, pedagogy via Bloom''s/scaffolding), research context, and prior
  knowledge links.


  **COMPLETE CONTENT SYNTHESIS:**

  - Definitions: BCM (continuity post-disruption), C-SCRM (NIST SP 800-161 supply chain risks), TPRM, Vendor Contracts.

  - Standards: NIST SP 800-161 r1 (C-SCRM strategies), NIST SP 800-53 (controls), ISO 22301 (BCM).

  - Best Practices: 1) Due diligence (security audits, BCM assessments); 2) SLAs with RTO (<4hrs critical), RPO (<1hr data
  loss); 3) Right-to-audit clauses (annual access); 4) BCM plan submission/review; 5) Incident reporting (24hrs notification);
  6) Testing requirements (quarterly drills); 7) Non-compliance penalties/exit clauses.

  - Sources: NIST SP 800-161 r1 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/161/r1/upd1/final), NIST SP 800-53 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final),
  ISO 22301.

  Generate flashcards progressively: 10-15 per Bloom''s level, balanced across layers. Ensure university pedagogy: active
  recall, interleaving, metacognition via explanations. Output STRICTLY in the specified JSON schema format only—no extra
