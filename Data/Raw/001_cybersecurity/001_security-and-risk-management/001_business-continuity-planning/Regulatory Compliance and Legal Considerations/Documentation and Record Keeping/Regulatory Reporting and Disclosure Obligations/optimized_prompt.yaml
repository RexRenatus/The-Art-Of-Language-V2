active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Using the SEC's materiality standard, debate whether a phishing attack that compromises employee credentials
    but does not lead to data exfiltration should be disclosed in an 8-K filing. Consider quantitative (e.g., cost) and qualitative
    (e.g., reputational risk) factors, and reference real cases like the 2023 MOVEit breach. Address common misconceptions
    that only data breaches are material or that threats alone trigger disclosure.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol:
    rules: Generate 3 distractors per MCQ based on voter-noted misconceptions (e.g., 'All incidents require 8-K' instead of
      materiality-based; 'Threats alone trigger disclosure'; 'No timeline limit'; 'Only data breaches material'). Use plausible
      errors from real cases (e.g., MOVEit). Ensure 1-2 distractors are common pitfalls.
    balance: Distractors promote analysis (e.g., confuse SEC with NIST or 8-K with 10-K).
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Regulatory Reporting and
  Disclosure Obligations (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Business Continuity Planning [related]
  > Regulatory Compliance and Legal Considerations > Documentation and Record Keeping > Regulatory Reporting and Disclosure
  Obligations).


  Generate 60 high-quality flashcards (10-15 per scaffolding layer) optimized for Anki/spaced repetition: active recall, Bloom''s
  progression, misconception correction. Incorporate research: SEC 2023 rules (sec.gov/files/rules/final/2023/33-11216.pdf)
  - cybersecurity incident (broad, incl. accidental), materiality (quant/qual), 8-K (4 biz days for material), 10-K annual;
  NIST CSF alignment; cases like MOVEit.


  Use exact learning objectives, active learning elements (e.g., discussion scenarios for cards), 4 scaffolding layers, and
  flashcard schema. Hierarchy under Regulatory Compliance; BCP integrated.


  Output JSON array of flashcards: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''hints'':
  [...], ''related_objective'': ''...'', ''layer'': 1-4, ''blooms_level'': ''REMEMBER''}}, ...]. Ensure distractors per protocol
  for MCQs. Balance: 20% remember/understand, 30% apply/analyze, 30% evaluate, 20% create. Promote university pedagogy.'
