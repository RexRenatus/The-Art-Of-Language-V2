active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the tension between GDPR Article 32 resilience requirements and cost constraints in business continuity
    planning. Use case studies like the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack—would stricter adherence to GDPR standards
    (e.g., resilience testing and 72-hour breach notifications) have mitigated the impact? Consider risk vs. practicality
    and share real-world examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For Multiple Choice: Always 4 options (1 correct). Distractors are plausible based on common misconceptions:

    - Semantic (similar terms, e.g., ''integrity'' vs. ''availability'').

    - Regulatory (wrong article, e.g., Art 25 vs. Art 32).

    - Practical (real but incomplete measures, e.g., ''backups only'' ignoring testing).

    - Extreme (overly simplistic or exaggerated, e.g., ''0-hour notification''). Ensure 70% pass rate for experts.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in GDPR continuity provisions.
  Use the provided topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Business Continuity Planning > Regulatory
  Compliance and Legal Considerations > Regulatory Frameworks and Standards > GDPR General Data Protection Regulation Continuity
  Provisions.


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert full scaffolding details above, including content].

  - Active Learning: Ensure flashcards support discussions/activities (e.g., scenario-based Qs).

  - Research Context: Security of Processing (Art 32: CIA+Resilience), Personal Data Breach (Art 4(12)), Data Protection by
  Design (Art 25), 72h notification (Art 33), DPIAs, ISO 27001, ICO/NCSC guidance.


  Generate flashcards per the exact Flashcard Schema above. Ensure progressive coverage: Layer 1 (foundational recall), building
  to Layer 4 (integrative creation). Make content complete, accurate, and exam-ready (e.g., CISSP-aligned). Vary difficulty
  per Bloom''s. Output ONLY the JSON array of flashcards.'
