active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a small group, debate the effectiveness of OMB Circular A-130's continuous monitoring requirements
    in addressing modern cyber threats like ransomware attacks on federal agencies (e.g., reference the 2021 Colonial Pipeline
    incident or recent OMB audits). Support your position with specific policy areas from A-130 and propose one improvement.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Related but wrong term (e.g., PII vs. sensitive data), (3) Outdated/exaggerated policy (e.g., periodic vs. continuous
    monitoring). Ensure distractors test nuance (e.g., from other regs like FISMA).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in regulatory frameworks like
  OMB Circular A-130. Use the provided scaffolding layers, learning objectives (spanning Bloom''s: Remember to Create), active
  learning activities, and flashcard schema to generate high-quality, university-level flashcards.


  Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Business Continuity Planning > Regulatory Compliance and
  Legal Considerations > Regulatory Frameworks and Standards > OMB Circular A-130 Federal Information Management.


  Incorporate full content from scaffolding (complete policy areas: Governance/CIO/SAOP, Security/FISMA, Privacy/PII, Acquisition,
  Records, etc.), prior knowledge (FISMA/Clinger-Cohen), case studies (e.g., OPM breach, OMB audits), and sources.


  Generate exactly 48 flashcards: 12 per scaffolding layer, balanced Bloom''s (2 Remember/Understand, 4 Apply/Analyze, 4 Evaluate/Create,
  2 mixed). Use schema format. Ensure active recall: questions scaffolded from simple definitions to scenario critiques/designs.
  Make explanations pedagogical for self-testing.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects. No extra text.'
