  discussion_prompt: In the context of a major cyberattack or natural disaster, debate whether prioritizing digital essential
    records over physical ones could lead to legal vulnerabilities. Use examples from NARA guidelines (e.g., duplication and
    off-site storage requirements) and recent incidents like ransomware attacks on hospitals (e.g., Change Healthcare 2024
    breach). Consider trade-offs in accessibility, format resilience, and compliance.
  peer_teaching: Pair students; one student explains 'emergency operating records' (e.g., operational plans, payroll for continuity)
    vs. 'legal/financial rights records' (e.g., contracts, deeds for post-event rights) using real-world examples, then switch
    roles for a teach-back with a 5-question partner quiz. Addresses common misconception that all records are equally vital
    regardless of emergency phase.
  problem_solving: 'Present a real-world scenario: A government agency faces flood damage from a hurricane. Provide a list
    of 20 sample records (e.g., employee rosters, property deeds, IT backups). In groups, classify as vital/non-vital, design
    a protection plan (duplication methods, off-site storage, recovery priorities), and simulate a 30-minute recovery exercise.
    Debrief on NARA step-by-step implementation.'

    (ignores prioritization), 2) Confusing emergency operating with legal records (mixes operational vs. rights focus), 3)
    Ignoring digital formats in cyber contexts (overemphasizes physical), 4) Omitting testing (focuses only on storage), 5)
    Terminology errors (vital statistics vs. essential records). Ensure 1-2 per MCQ directly test key distinctions.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity training, particularly Vital Records Management
  Training (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Business Continuity Planning > Testing, Training,
  and Exercises > Training Programs > Vital Records Management Training). Generate high-quality, pedagogically optimized flashcards
  using university-style methods: Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, 4-layer scaffolding, and evidence-based distractors.


  Core Content: Vital/essential records are needed for emergency operations (emergency operating records: e.g., plans for
  continuity) or legal/financial rights (e.g., contracts post-event). Key to COOP/BCP. Standards: NARA (planning/inventory/testing),
  FEMA (COOP integration). Prioritize digital/physical protection amid cyber/disasters.
