        "core_logic": "Continuous monitoring is essential because it provides the constant stream of data necessary to detect subtle anomalies or indicators of compromise early on. Because early detection is the prerequisite for timely incident declaration and activation, effective continuous monitoring directly supports an efficient and effective activation decision-making process.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors misrepresent continuous monitoring as a tool for automated resolution, post-incident reporting, or a replacement for human analysis, failing to recognize its fundamental role in providing the ongoing visibility required for early detection, which is the precursor to activating incident response.",
        "analogy": "Continuous monitoring is like having security cameras running 24/7; they don't automatically stop a crime, but they provide the evidence needed to spot suspicious activity early, allowing security personnel to decide when to intervene (activate response)."
