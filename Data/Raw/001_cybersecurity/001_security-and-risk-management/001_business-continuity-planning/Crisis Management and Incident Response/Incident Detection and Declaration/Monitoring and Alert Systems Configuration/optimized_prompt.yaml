active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a small group, debate the trade-offs of deploying IDS versus IPS in a resource-constrained enterprise
    environment focused on business continuity. Consider factors like false positives, response times, and integration with
    SIEM—how might these choices affect incident declaration during a crisis? Synthesize group insights into a shared pros/cons
    matrix.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  flashcards (5 per scaffolding layer) for the topic ''Monitoring and Alert Systems Configuration'' in the hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > Security And Risk Management > Business Continuity Planning > Crisis Management and Incident Response > Incident Detection
  and Declaration > Monitoring and Alert Systems Configuration.


  Incorporate these learning objectives: [insert full list from JSON]. Use research context: Core concepts (System Monitoring,
  Alerting, IDS, IPS, SIEM, IOCs); standards/frameworks for aggregation/analysis.


  Structure generation by scaffolding layers: [insert full layers from JSON]. Align flashcards progressively: Layer 1 basic
  recall, up to Layer 4 synthesis.


  Include active learning hooks in explanations (e.g., reference discussion/peer teaching/problems).


  Strictly follow this flashcard schema: [insert full schema from JSON]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 20 flashcards, e.g.,
  [{''id'':1, ...}, ...]. Ensure variety: 50% QA, 50% MCQ; span all Bloom''s levels; distractors plausible per protocol. Optimize
