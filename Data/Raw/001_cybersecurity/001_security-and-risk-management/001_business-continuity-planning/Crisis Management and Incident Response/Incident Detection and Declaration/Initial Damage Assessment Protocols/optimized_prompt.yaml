active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the potential organizational consequences of rushing or inadequately performing
    initial damage assessment during a live ransomware incident. Reference NIST CSF 2.0 Detect (DE.AE) and Respond (RS) functions
    to support your arguments, and propose mitigation strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Distractor 2: Plausible but incorrect related term/concept (e.g., swap NIST CSF functions).'
    - 'Distractor 3: Edge case or outdated practice (e.g., pre-NIST SP 800-61r3 approach).'
    - Ensure distractors are realistic and derived from research context to promote active error-based learning.
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, following university-level\
  \ pedagogy (Bloom's Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic 'Initial Damage\
  \ Assessment Protocols' in the hierarchy: Level 1: Cybersecurity > Level 2: Security And Risk Management > Level 3: Business\
  \ Continuity Planning > Level 4: Crisis Management and Incident Response > Level 5: Incident Detection and Declaration >\
  \ Level 6: Initial Damage Assessment Protocols.\n\nIncorporate these exact learning objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives\
  \ ARRAY HERE].\nEnsure coverage of scaffolding layers: [INSERT scaffolding ARRAY HERE].\nDraw from research context: NIST\
  \ SP 800-61r3 defines cybersecurity incidents and adverse events; initial damage assessment determines scope/impact quickly\
  \ within NIST CSF 2.0 (Detect DE.AE, Respond RS).\n\nUse this exact flashcard schema: [INSERT flashcard_schema HERE]. Output\
  \ ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, e.g., [\n  {\n    \"front\": \"...\",\n    \"back\": \"...\",\n    \"explanation\": \"\
  ...\",\n    \"type\": \"mcq\",\n    \"bloom_level\": \"Apply\",\n    \"layer\": 3,\n    \"tags\": [\"Cybersecurity\", \"\
  Security And Risk Management\"],\n    \"options\": [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"]  // for MCQ only\n  }\n].\n\nBalance: 5-10\
  \ cards per layer, align to objectives/active learning (e.g., scenario questions for problem-solving). Make explanations\
  \ educational, referencing NIST. Voter consensus low (0% approval), so prioritize NIST-grounded accuracy over suggestions."
