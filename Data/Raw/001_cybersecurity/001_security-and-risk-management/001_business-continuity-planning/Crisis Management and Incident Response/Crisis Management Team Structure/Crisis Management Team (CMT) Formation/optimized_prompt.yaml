active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages and disadvantages of adopting an autocratic decision-making
    model in a CMT versus a democratic one during a high-stakes cyber crisis. Use examples from NIST or CISA guidelines to
    support your arguments and consider impacts on response speed and organizational reputation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in 'Crisis Management Team\
  \ (CMT) Formation' (Topic Hierarchy: L1 Cybersecurity > L2 Security And Risk Management > L3 Business Continuity Planning\
  \ > L4 Crisis Management and Incident Response > L5 Crisis Management Team Structure > L6 CMT Formation). Use this research\
  \ context: CMT is a pre-designated group of non-technical leaders for cyber crises (severe incidents threatening integrity/confidentiality/availability\
  \ per NIST); autocratic decision-making; integrates with IRP (CISA); supported by SMEs. Incorporate Bloom's Taxonomy objectives:\
  \ Remember key terms (e.g., Cyber Crisis, IRP); Understand roles; Apply formation steps; Analyze distinctions; Evaluate\
  \ structures; Create plans. Scaffolding: Layer 1 Foundation (terms); Layer 2 Components (structure); Layer 3 Implementation\
  \ (steps); Layer 4 Integration (BCP links). Active learning tie-ins in explanations.\n\nGenerate 25 high-quality flashcards\
  \ following this schema exactly:\n{\n  'cards': [\n    {\n      'id': 1,\n      'bloom_level': 'Remember',\n      'layer':\
  \ 1,\n      'front': 'Question text',\n      'back': {\n        'answer': '**Correct answer**',\n        'explanation':\

  \ via protocol: plausible misconceptions), 7 applied (scenarios). Ensure distractors test subtlety. Align to active learning\
  \ (e.g., 'Use in peer teaching'). Output ONLY valid JSON."
