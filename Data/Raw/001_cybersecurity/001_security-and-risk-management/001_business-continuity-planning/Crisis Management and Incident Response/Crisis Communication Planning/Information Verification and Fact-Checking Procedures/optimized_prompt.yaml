active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In small groups, debate the potential impacts of unverified misinformation during a cybersecurity crisis
    (e.g., a ransomware attack with false attribution claims). Propose and critique verification strategies, referencing NIST
    CSF principles, and reach a consensus on best practices for crisis communication.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 25 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Information Verification
  and Fact-Checking Procedures'' (Category: Cybersecurity; Domain: Security And Risk Management; Subdomain: Business Continuity
  Planning; Entry Domain: Crisis Management and Incident Response; Entry Subdomain: Crisis Communication Planning; Full Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Business Continuity Planning > Crisis Management and Incident Response >
  Crisis Communication Planning > Information Verification and Fact-Checking Procedures).


  Incorporate these learning objectives (span Bloom''s: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create):

  {learning_objectives array from above}


  Cover scaffolding layers progressively (5-7 cards per layer):

  {layer1}, {layer2}, {layer3}, {layer4 from above}


  Align to research context: Core concepts (information verification, fact-checking, trustworthiness, threat intelligence,
  cybersecurity risk management); NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) for verification in risk management/incident response.


  Support active learning: Include cards prompting discussion (e.g., scenario debates), peer-teaching summaries, problem-solving
  steps.


  Follow exact flashcard schema:

  {flashcard_schema from above}


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcards, each as: {"front": "Question stem with A/B/C/D options", "correct_answer": "A.
  [full answer text]", "explanation": "[detailed explanation]", "distractors": [{"option": "B. [text]", "why_wrong": "[brief
  reason]"}, ... ] }. Ensure variety (MCQ recall/application/analysis), no duplicates, web-grounded accuracy.'
