active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical implications of 'Risk Acceptance' when balancing cybersecurity
    costs against potential facility damage from hybrid cyber-physical attacks (e.g., ransomware causing physical access failures).
    Use examples from real-world incidents like the Colonial Pipeline hack to support arguments on whether full mitigation
    is always feasible.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
