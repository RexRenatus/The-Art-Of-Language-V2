  Content Sources (complete): NIST CSF/SP 800-61 (IR comms), FEMA PIO Training (IS-29.a Awareness, G-289 Basic, G-290 JIC),
  CISA Cyber Essentials, real examples (SolarWinds, Equifax breaches).


  Best Practices: Active recall (questions prompt retrieval), spaced repetition friendly (concise), university pedagogy (Bloom''s
  progression), distractors realistic. Ensure completeness, prior knowledge links, big picture (reputational resilience).
