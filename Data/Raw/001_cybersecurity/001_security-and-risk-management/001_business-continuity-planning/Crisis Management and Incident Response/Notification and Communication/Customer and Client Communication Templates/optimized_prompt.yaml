active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical and legal implications of delaying customer notifications during
    a cybersecurity incident. How do frameworks like NIST CSF 2.0 balance transparency with operational security? Support
    your arguments with real-world examples from recent breaches.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (2) Plausible but incomplete (e.g., missing legal disclaimer), (3) Extreme/opposite error (e.g., ''Over-share all technical
    details''). Ensure distractors are realistic, derived from research context or typical pitfalls in incident communication.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, following university pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Topic: Customer and Client Communication Templates (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > Security And Risk Management > Business Continuity Planning > Crisis Management and Incident Response > Notification and
  Communication > Customer and Client Communication Templates). Use research context: NIST CSF 2.0 for risk management/incident
  response, emphasis on transparency, trust, timely notifications.
