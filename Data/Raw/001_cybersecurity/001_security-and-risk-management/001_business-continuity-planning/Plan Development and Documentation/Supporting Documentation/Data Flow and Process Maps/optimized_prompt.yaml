active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how DFDs and Process Maps could have prevented a real-world breach (e.g.,
    SolarWinds supply chain attack) by mapping vendor data flows. What NIST ID.AM gaps were exposed, and how would BCP integration
    improve resilience?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Common error (e.g., ignore external entities in BCP), 3) Partial truth (e.g., valid in non-cyber context). Ensure distractors
    teach by correction in explanation. Balance card types: 30% remember/understand, 30% apply/analyze, 40% evaluate/create.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in CISSP-aligned content.
  Generate 75 high-quality flashcards on ''Data Flow and Process Maps'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Active Learning: Inspire critical thinking (e.g., reference discussion on breaches).

  - Scaffolding: 4 layers [insert full descriptions above]; tag each card with layer.

  - Big Picture: Mastery enables disruption simulation for BCP resilience; links SOX/GDPR/vendor risks.

  - Prior Knowledge: Builds on asset inventories (NIST ID.AM), basic diagrams.

  - Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (ID.AM, GV.OC), CISSP Domain 1 (full: Security/Risk Mgmt incl. risk assessment 1.2, controls 1.5,
  BCP 1.8), ISO 22301.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly [insert full schema above]. Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'':
