active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a scenario where a company faces a ransomware attack, debate the trade-offs between minimizing RTO
    (downtime) and RPO (data loss). How do NIST SP 800-34 and SP 800-184 guidelines influence your recovery strategy? Consider
    real-world examples like the 2021 Colonial Pipeline incident.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

  Recovery Plan (DRP) for IT Systems.


  Use the following to generate 50 high-quality flashcards:


  **Topic Hierarchy:** Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Business Continuity Planning > Plan Development and
  Documentation > Plan Types and Hierarchy > DRP for IT Systems.


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s Taxonomy):** [Insert full list from ''learning_objectives'' above].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full list from ''scaffolding_layers'' above]. Distribute flashcards: 15 Layer 1, 15 Layer
  2, 10 Layer 3, 10 Layer 4.


  **Active Learning Integration:** Tie flashcards to activities where possible (e.g., ''Use in ransomware debate'').


  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly follow [insert full ''flashcard_schema'' above]. Balance: 20 Basic Q/A, 20 MCQ (with distractor
  protocol), 10 Scenario-Based. Ensure 20% coverage per Bloom''s level.


  **Content Sources (Complete Research Context):**

  - DRP: Structured plan to restore IT after disruptions (cyberattacks, disasters).

  - Key Terms: DR (restore IT), DRP (IT-focused plan), BCP (holistic continuity), RTO (max downtime), RPO (max data loss).

  - NIST SP 800-34 Rev. 1: 7 Steps - 1. Policy, 2. BIA, 3. Controls, 4. Strategies, 5. Plan, 6. Test/Train, 7. Maintain.

  - NIST SP 800-184: Cybersecurity Event Recovery - Preparation, Identification, Containment/Eradication, Recovery, Lessons
  Learned.

  - Prior Knowledge: BIA, risk mgmt.

  - Big Picture: CISSP Domain 1; e.g., 2023 ransomware costs $4.88M avg. (IBM).

  - Sources: NIST SP 800-34 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-34.pdf), NIST SP 800-184
