active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how the OE Plan serves as the tactical immediate-response layer in the
    BCP hierarchy within Security and Risk Management. How does it connect to cybersecurity risks, such as communication failures
    during a cyber-physical emergency? Reference CISA guidelines and prior knowledge of OSHA EAPs to support your arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: (1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse DO with OEC), (2) Related
    but incorrect term (e.g., EAP instead of OE Plan), (3) Partial truth (e.g., role from wrong context). Ensure plausibility
    based on research context; explain why each is incorrect.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality flashcards for ''Occupant Emergency Plan (OEP)''
  in the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Business Continuity Planning > Plan Development and
  Documentation > Plan Types and Hierarchy > Occupant Emergency Plan (OEP).


  Incorporate:

  - Research: CISA.gov OEPs (Program: short-term response with OEO + OE Plan; Plan: procedures for federal spaces; DO: highest
  official; OEC: coordinator). ISC Guide standards. Distinguish OEP (Program) vs. OE Plan.

  - Voter consensus (82.9%): Explicit Bloom''s progression, 4-layer scaffolding, EAP connections, complete standards/sources.


  Use this EXACT schema for 20-30 flashcards:

  Cover ALL learning_objectives (1 per 4-5 cards), scaffold layers evenly, integrate active learning (e.g., scenario Qs for
  problem-solving). Ensure measurable, precise verbs. Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'',
