  discussion_prompt: 'In a small group, debate the statement: ''Personnel succession planning is more critical in cybersecurity
    than in other IT domains due to the high-stakes nature of threats.'' Support your position with references to NIST frameworks
    and real-world breach examples (e.g., knowledge loss in incidents like SolarWinds). Identify two pros and two cons, then
    propose optimizations.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

  **Completed Research Context:** Succession planning identifies/develops successors for critical cybersecurity roles to mitigate
  risks like knowledge loss. Objectives: mitigate risk, ensure continuity, develop talent, enhance resilience, retention.
  Frameworks: NIST NICE (TKS → Competencies → 33 Work Roles in 7 Categories/52 Areas, e.g., Protect and Defend); NIST RMF
  (SP 800-37: integrates in Prepare/Categorize/Monitor to manage personnel risks as single points of failure); NIST SP 800-53
  (PS controls); SP 800-34 (BCP). Best Practices (Layer 3): 1) ID roles w/NICE. 2) Assess gaps. 3) IDPs/training. 4) Timelines.
  5) Monitor. Sources: NIST NICE (nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice); SP 800-37 (doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-37r2);
  SP 800-53 (nist.gov/800-53); SP 800-34 (csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/34/r1/final).


  **Pedagogy:** Align to these objectives [insert learning_objectives array]. Use 4 scaffolding layers [insert scaffolding_layers
  object]. Incorporate active learning hooks [insert active_learning object].


  **Generate Flashcards:** Output 75 flashcards in JSON array: [{''front'': ''... (Bloom: LEVEL, Layer: #)'', ''back'': {''answer'':
  ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'', ''opt3''], ''hook'': ''...'', ''source'': ''...''
  }}]. Follow schema [insert flashcard_schema object exactly]. Ensure measurable, active, progressive learning. Vary difficulty
  per Bloom''s.'
