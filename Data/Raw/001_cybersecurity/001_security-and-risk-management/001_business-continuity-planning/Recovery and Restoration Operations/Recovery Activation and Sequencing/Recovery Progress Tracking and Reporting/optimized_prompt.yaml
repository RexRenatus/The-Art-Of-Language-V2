active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a ransomware attack recovery scenario, what key metrics should be tracked for progress (e.g., percentage
    of systems restored, data integrity verified, RTO/RPO achievement)? Debate the trade-offs between detailed technical reporting
    versus concise executive summaries for stakeholders, considering factors like decision-making speed and compliance needs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Source-grounded: Draw from NIST misinterpretations or real-world pitfalls (e.g., overemphasize speed over verification).'

  25-30 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Recovery Progress Tracking and Reporting'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security
  & Risk Management > Business Continuity Planning > Recovery and Restoration Operations > Recovery Activation and Sequencing
  > Recovery Progress Tracking and Reporting).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding layers: [PASTE FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM ABOVE]

  - Active learning ties: Reference discussions/problems where relevant.

  - Research context: NIST CSF 2.0 Recover (RC), SP 800-61 Rev. 3, definitions (cybersecurity incident, recovery tracking/reporting),
  metrics (RTO/RPO, systems restored, data integrity).

  - Voter priorities: Completeness (full NIST details), metrics examples, prior knowledge links, concept map/big picture.
