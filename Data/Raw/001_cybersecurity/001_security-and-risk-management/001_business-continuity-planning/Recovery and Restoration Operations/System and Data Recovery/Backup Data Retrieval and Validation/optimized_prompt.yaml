  discussion_prompt: Given limited resources during a ransomware attack like the Colonial Pipeline incident, should an organization
    prioritize minimizing RTO (Recovery Time Objective) or RPO (Recovery Point Objective) in their backup strategy? Debate
    the trade-offs in cost, security, business impact, and recovery reliability, using real-world examples and referencing
    NIST CSF Recover function.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains core concepts (e.g., immutable backups as a 'locked safe that can't be opened
    or altered until a set time', soft delete as 'trash bin with a recovery window', purge protection as 'final delete lock')
    to their partner using simple analogies. Switch roles, then quiz each other on applications in ransomware recovery. Debrief
    as a group on misconceptions.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A mid-sized company suffers a ransomware attack; backups may be corrupted. Outline step-by-step
    data retrieval and validation (1. Verify integrity with checksums; 2. Mount backup; 3. Restore selectively; 4. Validate
    post-restore against RTO/RPO). Recommend tools/standards (e.g., NIST SP 800-53 CP-9, immutable storage). Simulate with
    mock backup files (provide sample checksums/hashes) and assess alignment with business continuity goals.'

    Partial truth (e.g., valid for different context), 3) Extreme/opposite (e.g., ignore immutability). Ensure distractors
    test subtle understanding.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate high-quality Anki-style flashcards
  for the topic ''Backup Data Retrieval and Validation'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Business
  Continuity Planning > Recovery and Restoration Operations > System and Data Recovery > Backup Data Retrieval and Validation).


  Incorporate:

  - Prior knowledge: Basic backups, NIST CP-2, BCP fundamentals.

  - Learning objectives: [Insert learning_objectives array here].

  - Scaffolding: Use 4 layers exactly as defined [Insert scaffolding_layers here].

  - Active learning for context: [Insert active_learning here].

  - Sources: Cite where relevant [Insert sources here].


  Output 25 flashcards in the exact schema:

  {flashcard_schema.structure}. Follow distractor protocol strictly. Ensure university-level pedagogy: active recall, spaced
  repetition, Bloom''s progression. Each flashcard must reference scaffolding layer and Bloom''s level in tags (e.g., Tags:
  L1 Remember). Make questions concise, answers precise, explanations 2-4 sentences linking to standards/real-world (e.g.,
  ransomware). Vary formats evenly.'
