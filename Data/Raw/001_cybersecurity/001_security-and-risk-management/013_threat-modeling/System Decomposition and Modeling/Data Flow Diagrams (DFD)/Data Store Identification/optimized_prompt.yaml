active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In threat modeling with DFDs, should transient data in browser caches or mobile app local storage be
    classified as data stores? Debate using real-world breach examples like Equifax, considering NIST CSF ID.AM-2, and address
    misconceptions that data stores are only databases.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs based on common misconceptions: 1. Confuse with data flows/transient
    data (e.g., browser cache), 2. Over-generalize to non-persistent elements (e.g., network packets), 3. Mix with external
    entities or processes. Ensure distractors are realistic from research context (e.g., Equifax-style breaches) and explain
    why incorrect on back.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in threat modeling. Topic:
  Data Store Identification (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Threat Modeling > System Decomposition
  and Modeling > Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) > Data Store Identification). Focus: Identifying persistent data repositories (e.g.,
  databases, files, AWS S3) in DFDs for threat modeling, distinguishing from general inventories or transient data.
