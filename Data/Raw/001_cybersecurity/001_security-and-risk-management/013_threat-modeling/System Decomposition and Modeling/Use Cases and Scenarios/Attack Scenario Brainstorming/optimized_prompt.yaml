  discussion_prompt: In groups of 4, debate the most critical threat actors (e.g., nation-state vs. insider) for a cloud-based
    e-commerce platform. Use real-world examples (e.g., SolarWinds breach) to justify how they influence attack scenario prioritization,
    and link to prior knowledge from system decomposition (DFDs) and use cases.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., confuse TTPs with vulnerabilities), (2) Similar terms (e.g., threat event vs. vulnerability event), (3) Outdated/incomplete
    info (e.g., old ATT&CK tactic names), (4) Framework mix-ups (e.g., STRIDE category as ATT&CK). Ensure distractors teach
    via elimination.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Threat Modeling under Security
  and Risk Management. Topic: Attack Scenario Brainstorming (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Threat
  Modeling > System Decomposition and Modeling > Use Cases and Scenarios > Attack Scenario Brainstorming). Voter consensus
  (100% approval): Emphasize completeness (full NIST SP 800-30: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-30r1 - steps: Prepare

  Incorporate pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives [insert learning_objectives array here verbatim]. Active learning for
  context [insert active_learning object here verbatim]. Scaffolding 4 layers [insert scaffolding array here verbatim]. Ensure
  progressive complexity, prior links (DFDs/use cases), examples (e.g., Phishing->Execution->Exfiltration).


  Generate flashcards per exact schema [insert flashcard_schema here verbatim]. Cover all layers/objectives evenly (Layer1:20%,
  L2:25%, L3:30%, L4:25%). Variety: Include NIST process steps, ATT&CK tactics (e.g., TA0001 Initial Access), full scenario
  examples. Output ONLY as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''tags'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...''},
  ...]. Ensure high-quality, measurable, educational value. No extra text.'
