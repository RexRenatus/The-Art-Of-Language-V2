  peer_teaching: 'In pairs, one student explains the differences between authentication (e.g., OIDC for identity verification)
    and authorization (e.g., OAuth 2.0 scopes for access control) using a hand-drawn diagram of an API request flow. Then
    switch roles: the partner teaches back with a real-world example from API gateways (e.g., Kong or AWS API Gateway), addressing
    the misconception that API keys suffice for both.'
  problem_solving: 'Given a real-world scenario: A company''s API integrates with a third-party logistics provider vulnerable
    to Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) and injection attacks. In small groups, model threats using STRIDE, propose
    layered controls (e.g., rate limiting, input schema validation, mTLS), and conduct a mock code review on sample pseudocode.
    Present findings and iterate based on peer feedback.'

    based on voter-noted misconceptions and research (e.g., confusing authN/authZ).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 30 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''API and Integration
  Point Security'' in the hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Threat Modeling > Advanced and Emerging
  Topics > Supply Chain and Third-Party Risk > API and Integration Point Security.


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full array from ''learning_objectives'']

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert full scaffolding object]. Generate cards progressively: cite layer in hints.

  - Active Learning: Draw examples from [insert active_learning prompts] for scenario-based cards.

  - Research Context: Use OWASP API Top 10, NIST SP 800-228, OAuth 2.0/OIDC, STRIDE/DREAD, zero-trust, supply chain (e.g.,
  Log4Shell). Big picture: Critical for 80% API-involved breaches; CISSP Domain 1.


  Follow this exact schema for each flashcard:
