  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the statement: ''Federated Learning provides sufficient privacy protection against all inference
    attacks.'' Divide into groups to prepare arguments for and against, citing specific attack vectors like model inversion,
    membership inference, or property inference from the topic. Discuss as a class, referencing real-world examples like cross-device
    FL on smartphones.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: (1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse poisoning with evasion), (2) Partial truth
      (e.g., correct for different FL type), (3) Plausible unrelated/alternative (e.g., non-FL threat like SQL injection).'
    - Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter-noted truncations (e.g., incomplete poisoning details) and standard
      FL pitfalls.
    - 'Balance difficulty: 1 easy (obvious wrong), 1 medium (requires analysis), 1 hard (close to correct).'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in 'Federated Learning Threats'\
  \ (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Threat Modeling > Advanced and Emerging Topics > Threat\
  \ Modeling for AI/ML Systems > Federated Learning Threats). Use the provided research context (complete truncations: poisoning\
  \ attacks are stealthy, especially backdoors with subtle triggers; by timing: training-time (poisoning/Byzantine), inference-time\
  \ (evasion/inference); server-side: model replacement, free-riding; defenses: DP, secure MPC, robust aggregation (Krum,\
  \ etc.); standards: NIST AI RMF, OWASP Top 10 for ML; best practices: client selection, norm clipping), supplemented by\
  \ standard knowledge.\n\nIncorporate:\n- Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]\n- Active Learning: Tie 20% cards\
  \ to activities (e.g., debate inference attacks, hospital VFL scenario).\n- Scaffolding Layers: [insert full list above]\
  \ – Distribute cards evenly.\n- Bloom's Coverage: Balanced across levels.\n\nGenerate 75 high-quality flashcards following\
  \ the exact Flashcard Schema [insert schema above]. Output ONLY a JSON array of objects, e.g., [\n  {\n    \"question\"\
