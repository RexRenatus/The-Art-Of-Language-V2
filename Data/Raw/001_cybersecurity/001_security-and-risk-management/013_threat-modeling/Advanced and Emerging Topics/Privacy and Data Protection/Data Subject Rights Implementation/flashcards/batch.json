        "core_logic": "The right to object (GDPR Article 21) provides individuals with control over certain types of data processing, because individuals should have agency over how their data is used, especially for marketing. This functions by allowing objections based on legitimate interests or direct marketing, distinct from the right of access (Article 15), which focuses on transparency and verification of existing processing.",
