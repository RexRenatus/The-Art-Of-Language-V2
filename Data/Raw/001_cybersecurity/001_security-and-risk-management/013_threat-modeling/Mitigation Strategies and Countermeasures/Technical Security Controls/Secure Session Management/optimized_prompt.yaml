active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast session management in stateless (JWT) vs stateful (server-side sessions) architectures.
    What are the threat models and mitigations for each? Debate real-world trade-offs for a high-traffic e-commerce site,
    considering scalability, security, and compliance with NIST SP 800-63B.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains NIST SP 800-63B session binding requirements (e.g., binding to IP address
    and user agent) to their partner, who then teaches back with an example of improper cookie configuration leading to hijacking.
    Switch roles and discuss common misconceptions like 'Tokens = active session'.
  problem_solving: Given a vulnerable web app scenario (e.g., session ID exposed in URL queries), teams identify threats using
    the STRIDE model, propose countermeasures like HttpOnly/Secure flags, session regeneration, and timeouts, then prototype
    a fix in pseudocode or diagram form.

  **Research Context (Complete Summary):** Secure Session Management maintains authenticated user state securely. Core concepts:
  Session (authenticated period); Session Secret (unique server-generated value); Session Binding (ties secret to client IP/user-agent
  per NIST SP 800-63B §5.2.2); Session Termination (logout, inactivity timeout e.g., 8-15 hours max per NIST, or shorter idle);
  Reauthentication (for high-risk actions like transfers, per NIST §5.2.3). Best practices (OWASP Session Management Cheat
  Sheet): Regenerate ID on login/priv change; HttpOnly/Secure/SameSite=Strict/Lax cookies; limit concurrent sessions; mitigate
  fixation (regenerate pre-auth), hijacking (binding/TLS), CSRF (tokens/SameSite). Vulnerabilities: OWASP Top 10 A05:2021
  (Misconfig), session fixation/hijacking. NIST SP 800-63B: Bind to mutable (user-agent) and non-mutable (IP) attributes;
  terminate on explicit logout or max lifetime. Sources: NIST SP 800-63B/63-4, OWASP Cheat Sheet, OWASP Top 10.

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the scaffolding array here]. Strictly organize flashcards by these layers for progressive
  learning.


  **Active Learning Integration:** Draw from [insert active_learning object here] for scenario-based cards (e.g., debate trade-offs
  in questions).


  **Big Picture:** Essential for threat modeling (STRIDE: Spoofing via fixation, Tampering via CSRF); voter consensus 82.9%
  on pedagogy/completeness.


  **Task:** Generate 45 flashcards in JSON array format, following flashcard_schema exactly. Ensure coverage: 8-10 per Bloom
  level, balanced layers/types. Questions grounded in research; explanations tie to objectives/standards. Output ONLY the
  JSON array of flashcards, no extra text.'
