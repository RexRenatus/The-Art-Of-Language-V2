  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''TaaC fully replaces manual threat modeling in large-scale
    DevSecOps environments.'' Support your position with principles, benefits, tools (e.g., ThreatSpec, pytm), and potential
    limitations, drawing on STRIDE/DREAD frameworks and real-world examples.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Threat Modeling as Code
  (TaaC) under the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Threat Modeling > Threat Modeling Tools
  and Automation > Threat Modeling as Code (TaaC) > TaaC Principles and Benefits.


  CRITICAL: TaaC means Threat Modeling as Code (codifying threat models in YAML/JSON for STRIDE threats, data flows; tools:
  ThreatSpec, pytm, OWASP Threat Dragon; principles: declarative, version control, automation, reproducibility; benefits:
  CI/CD, collaboration, scalability). IGNORE any Zero Trust or ''Trust as a Service'' content.

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving (e.g., hints referencing activities).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM ABOVE].


  Use this exact Flashcard Schema [INSERT FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Output ONLY in JSON array format: [{''front'': ''...'',
  ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'', ''opt3'']}, ''metadata'':
  {...}}, ...]. Generate 75 high-quality, accurate flashcards covering principles (declarative modeling, etc.), benefits,
  tools, examples, comparisons. Ensure active recall, spaced repetition suitability, and progression from foundation to integration.'
