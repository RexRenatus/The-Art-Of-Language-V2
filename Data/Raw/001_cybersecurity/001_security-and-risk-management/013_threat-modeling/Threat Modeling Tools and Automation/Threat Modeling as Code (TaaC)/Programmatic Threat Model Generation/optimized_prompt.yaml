active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of programmatic vs. manual threat modeling in a DevSecOps
    context. How does automation enable 'shift-left' security while potentially missing nuanced human insights? Provide examples
    from microservices or cloud environments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 1. Partial truths (e.g., 'Manual only' when automation is key). 2. Common misconceptions (e.g., 'Ignores
    human input entirely'). 3. Superficially similar (e.g., 'Code scanning' vs. architecture analysis). Ensure plausible for
    mid-level learners; avoid obvious errors.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Topic: Programmatic Threat Model Generation
  (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Threat Modeling > Threat Modeling Tools and Automation > Threat
  Modeling as Code (TaaC) > Programmatic Threat Model Generation). Use the provided Learning Objectives, Active Learning components,
  4-Layer Scaffolding (with Prior Knowledge, Big Picture, completed ISO/IEC 27001, full Sources), and Flashcard Schema EXACTLY.


  Research Context: Programmatic threat model generation automates threat models via software/scripts analyzing architecture/code/config
  for SDLC integration. Differs from manual by speed/consistency/scalability. Standards: MITRE ATT&CK (adversary tactics),
  NIST SP 800-53/800-154 (threat intel/controls), ISO/IEC 27001 (Annex A.12.6.1 for automated risk treatment in ISMS). Tools:
  pytm, Threat Dragon automation, custom scripts. Benefits: Shift-left, microservices scale.
