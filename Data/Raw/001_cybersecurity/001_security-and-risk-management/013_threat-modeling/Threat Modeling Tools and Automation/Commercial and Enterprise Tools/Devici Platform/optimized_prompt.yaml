active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages and disadvantages of adopting commercial enterprise threat
    modeling tools (e.g., IriusRisk or ThreatModeler) over free alternatives like OWASP Threat Dragon. Consider factors such
    as cost, support, customization, and automation depth. Provide evidence from real-world case studies or tool documentation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - Active Learning: Use to inspire scenario-based cards (e.g., MCQs from discussion debates).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4.


  Generate flashcards following this exact schema: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD_SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Output ONLY a JSON array of
  flashcards, each as an object: {"type": "MCQ|Basic|Cloze", "front": "...", "back": "...", "explanation": "...", "bloom_level":
