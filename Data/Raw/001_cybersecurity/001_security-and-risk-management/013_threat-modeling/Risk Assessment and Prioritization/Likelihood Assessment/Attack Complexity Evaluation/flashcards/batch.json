This functions by providing a crucial input into the risk assessment process that feeds into ERM, connecting to the NIST IR 8286 series' goal of integrating cybersecurity and ERM.",

Attack complexity is like understanding the difficulty of a specific investment opportunity; a very complex, risky investment might be avoided or require more capital (risk response), influencing the overall financial strategy."
