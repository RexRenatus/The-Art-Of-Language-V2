  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the real-world implications of the CVSS UI metric: Should vulnerabilities
    requiring Active user interaction (e.g., phishing clicks) be deprioritized compared to those with None? Use examples from
    recent CVEs like Log4Shell or WannaCry to support your arguments, considering exploitability and threat modeling.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Generate 3 distractors for MCQ cards: D1 (common error, e.g., confuse UI with AC), D2 (value reversal, e.g., swap Passive/Active
      multipliers), D3 (off-topic, e.g., mix with Scope metric).'
    - Ensure distractors are plausible based on CVSS docs.
    - 'Short answer/cloze: No distractors, but suggest 2-3 in explanation.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert CVSS flashcard generator focused on ''User Interaction Requirement'' in Cybersecurity (Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Threat Modeling > Risk Assessment and Prioritization > CVSS Scoring System
  > User Interaction Requirement). Use FIRST.org CVSS v3.1/v4.0 specification: UI metric values (None=0.85, Passive=0.62,
  Active=0.55) in Exploitability Score.


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding Layers: Distribute cards across 4 layers (5-8 cards/layer). Layer 1: Definitions; Layer 2: Formulas/Relations;
  Layer 3: Calculations; Layer 4: Threat Integration.

  - Active Learning Tie-ins: Include 2-3 cards referencing discussion/peer/problem-solving (e.g., ''In a peer teach, explain
  why UI:Active lowers score'').


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards in JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''distractors'': [''D1'',''D2'',''D3''], ''source'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': 1}}, ...]. Follow
  exact schema. Ensure accuracy: Focus ONLY on CVSS UI, not general human-centric security. Use real CVEs (e.g., Log4Shell
  UI:Passive). Distractors per protocol. Vary formats: 12 MCQ, 8 Cloze, 5 Short Answer.'
