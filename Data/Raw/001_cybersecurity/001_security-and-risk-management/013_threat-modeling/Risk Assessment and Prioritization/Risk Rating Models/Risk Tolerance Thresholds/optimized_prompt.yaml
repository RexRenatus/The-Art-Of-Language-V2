active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how risk tolerance thresholds should vary across industries (e.g., finance
    vs. healthcare). Provide examples of why a bank's cyber downtime threshold might be stricter than a retailer's, and justify
    using NISTIR 8286 guidance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors from: (1) Semantic shifts (e.g., ''risk appetite'' instead of ''thresholds''),
    (2) Partial truths (e.g., correct framework but wrong rev), (3) Common errors (e.g., qualitative only vs. measurable),
    (4) Industry misapplications. Ensure 70% plausibility to challenge learners.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Risk Tolerance Thresholds
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Threat Modeling > Risk Assessment and Prioritization >
  Risk Rating Models > Risk Tolerance Thresholds). Synthesize high-quality Anki-style flashcards using university pedagogy:
  Bloom''s Taxonomy progression, active learning, 4-layer scaffolding, and web-grounded research.


  **Core Content (from NIST/research):** Risk appetite: high-level risk philosophy. Risk tolerance: acceptable variation.
  Thresholds: measurable limits (e.g., prob/loss) triggering action. NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2: RMF integrates thresholds in risk
  prioritization (full desc: Prepare, Categorize, Select, Implement, Assess, Authorize, Monitor). NISTIR 8286/B: CSRM-ERM
  integration, thresholds for CSRR finalization. Sources: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/37/r2/final, https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/ir/8286/final,
