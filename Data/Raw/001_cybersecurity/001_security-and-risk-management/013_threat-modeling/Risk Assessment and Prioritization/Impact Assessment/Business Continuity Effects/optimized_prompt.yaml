active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between prioritizing short-term recovery (low RTO) versus long-term resilience
    in a cyber incident like ransomware. Use real-world examples such as the Colonial Pipeline attack to support your arguments,
    considering impacts on critical business functions and compliance with NIST CSF.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    from research (e.g., mix RTO/RPO), (3) Voter priorities (e.g., incomplete standards like ''ISO 27001'' instead of 22301),
    (4) Topic hierarchy (e.g., confuse with threat modeling basics). Ensure 1 high-plausibility, 1 low, 1 off-topic.'
