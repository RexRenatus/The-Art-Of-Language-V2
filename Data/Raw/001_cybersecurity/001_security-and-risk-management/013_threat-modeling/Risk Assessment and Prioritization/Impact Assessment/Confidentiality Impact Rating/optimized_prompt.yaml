active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how a High Confidentiality Impact Rating for Personally Identifiable Information
    (PII) influences resource prioritization in a resource-limited organization compared to a Moderate rating for internal
    operational data. Reference NIST SP 800-30 criteria and provide real-world examples like the Equifax breach.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (30% of cards): Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse
    with Integrity impact; mix Low/Mod/High criteria; use real but incorrect standards like ''ISO 27001 Low = no harm'').
    Ensure one is a near-miss (e.g., correct level but wrong criteria), one overly extreme, one too vague. Label correct answer
    clearly.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  using Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, and scaffolding. Generate 40 high-quality flashcards on ''Confidentiality Impact
  Rating'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Threat Modeling > Risk Assessment and Prioritization
  > Impact Assessment > Confidentiality Impact Rating).


  **Research Context (Complete):** Confidentiality Impact Rating assesses harm from unauthorized disclosure (CIA triad pillar).
  NIST FIPS 199/SP 800-30 scales: LOW (limited adverse effect on ops/assets/individuals, e.g., public data leak); MODERATE
  (serious adverse, e.g., financial/reputational damage from internal docs); HIGH (severe/catastrophic, e.g., PII/health data
  breach causing identity theft or national security harm). Methodology: 1) Classify data (SP 800-60), 2) Evaluate disclosure
  harm, 3) Rate and document. Big Picture: Prioritizes risks in NIST RMF (Risk = Threat x Vuln x Impact). Examples: High -
  Equifax PII breach; Moderate - leaked memos. Sources: FIPS 199 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/199/final), SP 800-30 Rev1
  (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/30/r1/final), SP 800-60 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/60/v1/r1/final), SP 1800-28
  (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1800-28.pdf), ISO 27005 (https://www.iso.org/standard/75281.html).
