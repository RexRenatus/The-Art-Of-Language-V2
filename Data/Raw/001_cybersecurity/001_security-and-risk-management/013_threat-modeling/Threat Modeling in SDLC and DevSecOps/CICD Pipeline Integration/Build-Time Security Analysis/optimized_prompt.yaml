learning_objectives:
  analyze:
  - objective: Compare build-time security analysis versus runtime analysis, identifying trade-offs in detection timing, false
      positives, and supply chain risk mitigation.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  remember:
  - objective: 'Define key terms: build-time security analysis, attestation, provenance, software supply chain, vulnerability,
      and risk.'
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  create:
  - objective: Design a build-time security analysis workflow for a sample project, incorporating SBOM generation, SLSA levels,
      and security gates in a CI/CD pipeline.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  understand:
  - objective: Explain the role of build-time security analysis in the SDLC, DevSecOps, and supply chain security, including
      its alignment with shift-left principles and prior knowledge of threat modeling (e.g., STRIDE or DREAD).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Demonstrate how to integrate security checks (e.g., SAST, SCA using tools like Snyk or GitHub Dependabot) into
      a CI/CD pipeline.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  evaluate:
  - objective: Critique the effectiveness of NIST SSDF (SP 800-218) and NIST SP 800-161 Rev. 1 practices in mitigating real-world
      supply chain attacks like SolarWinds or Log4j.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Topic: ''Build-Time Security Analysis''
  (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Threat Modeling > Threat Modeling in SDLC and DevSecOps > CI/CD
  Pipeline Integration > Build-Time Security Analysis). Use provided research summary: Build-time security analysis integrates
  checks into SDLC build process for early vuln/risk detection in supply chains. Key concepts: build process, supply chain,
  vuln, risk, attestation, provenance. Standards: NIST SP 800-218 SSDF (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-218.pdf),
  NIST SP 800-161r1 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-161r1). Tools: Snyk, Dependabot, OWASP Dependency-Check. Advanced:
  SLSA (https://slsa.dev/), SBOM. Context: Shift-left in DevSecOps, prevents SolarWinds/Log4j attacks.
