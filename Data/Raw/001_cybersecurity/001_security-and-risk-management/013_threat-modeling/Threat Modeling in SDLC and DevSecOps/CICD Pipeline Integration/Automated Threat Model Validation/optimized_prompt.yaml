active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a DevSecOps pipeline, debate the risks of over-relying on automated threat model validation versus
    manual reviews, using real-world examples like the Log4j vulnerability. Consider trade-offs in speed, accuracy, and human
    oversight.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one partner explains a threat modeling methodology (e.g., STRIDE) including its categories and
    automation potential; the partner then teaches it back with a CI/CD pipeline integration example.
  problem_solving: In groups, design a simple automated validation script using Python and OWASP ZAP to validate a threat
    model for a sample microservice, incorporating rule-based checks and test case generation.

  distractor_protocol: Generate exactly 3 distractors that are plausible (common misconceptions, partial truths, or related
    but incorrect concepts from frameworks like STRIDE/PASTA/ATT&CK/NIST CSF). Ensure they test nuance (e.g., confuse STRIDE
    categories, misalign ATT&CK tactics). Each distractor includes a brief 'why wrong' note on back.

  **Big Picture:** Enables scalable, continuous threat validation in SDLC for proactive security in DevSecOps.


  **Key Content:** Integrate definitions (threat model, modeling, validation, automation), frameworks (STRIDE, PASTA, MITRE
  ATT&CK, NIST CSF with Profiles: Current/Target/Gaps), tools (Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool, OWASP Threat Dragon, ThreatSpec,
  PyTM, IriusRisk, OWASP ZAP), techniques (static analysis, rule-based checks, test generation), CI/CD examples (GitHub Actions,
  Jenkins). Real-world: Log4j risks.


  **Sources:** OWASP Threat Modeling (owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling), MITRE ATT&CK (attack.mitre.org), NIST CSF
  (nist.gov/cyberframework), Microsoft TMT (docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/develop/threat-modeling-tool), Threat
  Dragon (github.com/OWASP/Threat-Dragon).


  **Output Exactly 50 Flashcards as JSON Array:** Follow flashcard_schema precisely: Multiple-choice (1 correct + exactly
  3 distractors), match hierarchy levels exactly, cover objectives/layers evenly. Vary question types (definition, comparison,
  scenario, tool selection). Ensure distractors are pedagogy-tested (plausible errors). No extra text.'
