        "core_logic": "Reviewing design documentation is essential because it provides the blueprint for understanding how controls are implemented and how changes might affect them, since changes interact with the existing architecture. This works by examining the system's structure and intended behavior, connecting to the principle of understanding the system before modifying it.",
