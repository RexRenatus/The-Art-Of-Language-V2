active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Should organizations prioritize reducing Time-to-Model Measurement over threat model comprehensiveness?
    Debate using real-world examples like the Equifax breach (2017), where delayed threat modeling contributed to vulnerabilities,
    and discuss trade-offs between speed and security quality.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., confuses Time-to-Model with Time-to-Remediate).'
    - 'Distractor 2: Similar but incorrect metric (e.g., model completeness % instead of time).'
    - 'Distractor 3: Extreme value or inverse (e.g., prioritizes comprehensiveness over efficiency).'
    - Ensure distractors are plausible, based on voter-noted confusions (e.g., speed vs. quality trade-offs), and grounded
      in research (NIST metrics).
    quantity: Always 3 distractors for MCQs; balance difficulty across Bloom's levels.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in threat modeling metrics.
  Topic: Time-to-Model Measurement (KPI measuring elapsed time from project initiation/threat ID to validated threat model
  completion, inferred from NIST SP 800-55 process efficiency metrics; not a standard term but analogous to security measurement
  programs).
