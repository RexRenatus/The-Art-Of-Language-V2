active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a scenario where multiple log sources show anomalous traffic from an internal IP, repeated failed
    logins to admin accounts, and unusual file access patterns on endpoints, debate the correlation rules that would link
    these events to a spear-phishing attack (leveraging TTPs like credential dumping from MITRE ATT&CK) versus a brute-force
    attempt. Consider the role of CTI in distinguishing these and potential KPIs like mean time to detect (MTTD).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Partial truth (e.g., benign event as incident); 3) Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., all events need CTI). Base on real-world
    errors from NIST docs or MITRE ATT&CK. Ensure 70% difficulty balanced across Bloom''s levels.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security Incident Correlation
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Threat Modeling > Organizational Implementation > Metrics
  and KPIs > Security Incident Correlation). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities, 4-layer scaffolding,
  research context (definitions: Event, Incident per FISMA/NIST SP 800-61r3 full: Preparation-Detection-Containment-Recovery-Post;
  CTI/IoCs/TTPs per NIST SP 800-150; NIST CSF DE.AE-03), and flashcard schema to generate 50 high-quality flashcards.


  Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom''s progression, active recall, spaced repetition. Tie cards to scaffolding layers,
  objectives, and activities (e.g., reference discussion scenarios in explanations). Ensure completeness with sources: NIST
  SP 800-61r3 (incident correlation in Detection/Analysis), 800-150, MITRE ATT&CK, CSF.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"front": "question", "back": {"correct_answer": "...", "explanation":
  "...", "options": ["A.", "B.", "C.", "D."], "bloom_level": "...", "layer": "1-4", "related_objective": 1-6}}. Balance: 10
  cards/layer, distractors per protocol. Prioritize voter consensus: pedagogy, completeness, scaffolding.'
