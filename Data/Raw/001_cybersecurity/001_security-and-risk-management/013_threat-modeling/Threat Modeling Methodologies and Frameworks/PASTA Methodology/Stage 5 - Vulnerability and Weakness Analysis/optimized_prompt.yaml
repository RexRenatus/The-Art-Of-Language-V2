  discussion_prompt: 'In the context of PASTA Stage 5, analyze the SolarWinds supply chain attack: Identify key vulnerabilities
    and predisposing conditions (e.g., process weaknesses in third-party software validation), score their exploitability
    using CVSS v4.0 metrics, and debate whether organizational predisposing conditions were more critical than technical vulnerabilities.
    Support your arguments with NIST SP 800-30r1 guidelines and prior PASTA stages.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
