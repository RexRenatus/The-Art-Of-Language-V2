        "core_logic": "DREAD, originating from Microsoft, was primarily for software vulnerability assessment, whereas NIST SP 800-30 provides a broader, more adaptable framework for organizational and information system risk management. This difference is crucial because NIST's approach supports a holistic risk management process, as outlined in its publications.",
