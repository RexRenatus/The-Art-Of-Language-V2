active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the effectiveness of FISMA's Risk Management Framework (RMF) in addressing emerging threats like
    AI-driven attacks compared to private sector frameworks like NIST CSF. Provide evidence from real-world incidents (e.g.,
    SolarWinds breach) and propose hybrid adaptations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    misconception (e.g., ATO as ''permanent'' vs. time-bound), 3) Related but incorrect framework (e.g., NIST CSF step instead
    of RMF). Ensure distractors are realistic from research context/common errors.'

  Incorporate this research context: FISMA (2002/2014 U.S. law) mandates info sec programs for federal agencies/contractors
  protecting CIA triad. Key: RMF (NIST SP 800-37: 7 steps - Categorize, Select, Implement, Assess, Authorize, Monitor, Dispose),
  SSP (security controls doc), ATO (formal approval by Authorizing Official), NIST SP 800-53 (controls), SP 800-39 (risk mgmt),
  SP 800-60 (info typing). Connect to threat modeling (e.g., RMF Categorize uses threats). Sources: NIST.gov publications,
  FISMA 2014 updates.


  Use these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list from JSON above]

  - Active Learning: Embed concepts from discussion/activities into higher-order cards (e.g., scenarios).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards: 30% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 20% Layer 4.

  - Prior knowledge: Link CIA triad/threat modeling basics.


  Generate 40 flashcards following this exact schema: [Insert full flashcard_schema.structure from JSON above]. Balance: 10
  Basic, 15 MCQ, 10 Application, 5 Cloze. Strictly follow distractor protocol.


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"type": "...", "front": "...", "back": "...", "explanation": "...",
  "bloom_level": "remember/understand/etc.", "layer": 1-4, "tags": ["array"], "source": "NIST SP 800-XX"}.

  Ensure active recall, no hints on front, university-level accuracy, spaced repetition optimization (concise, precise).'
