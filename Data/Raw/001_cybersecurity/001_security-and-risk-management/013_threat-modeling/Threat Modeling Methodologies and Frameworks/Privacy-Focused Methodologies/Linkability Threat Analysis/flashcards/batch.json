      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "k-anonymity is a privacy principle that directly combats linkability because by ensuring that any individual's data cannot be distinguished from at least k-1 other individuals based on quasi-identifiers, it prevents attackers from uniquely identifying and linking data points to specific persons.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors misinterpret k-anonymity by confusing it with encryption parameters, access control, or data retention periods, failing to grasp its core concept of ensuring a minimum number of records share the same quasi-identifiers.",
        "analogy": "k-anonymity is like ensuring that in a group of k people, you can't tell who is who based on a few common characteristics (like wearing the same hat and coat), because there are too many people with those same characteristics."
