active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a privacy-focused organization handling EU citizen data, debate whether NIST CSF 2.0's Govern function
    adequately addresses GDPR non-compliance risks compared to ISO 27001 Annex A controls. Use real-world examples like the
    Meta GDPR fine to support your position.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
