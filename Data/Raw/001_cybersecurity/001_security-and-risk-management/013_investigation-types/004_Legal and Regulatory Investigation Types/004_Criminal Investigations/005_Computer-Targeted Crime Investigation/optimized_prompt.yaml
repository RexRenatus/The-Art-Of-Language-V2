active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the ethical implications of using controversial digital forensics tools like keyloggers in computer-targeted
    crime investigations, balancing privacy rights with public safety. Consider real-world tensions from cases like the FBI's
    use of tools in high-profile hacks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Core Content Summary (complete and web-grounded): Computer-targeted crime investigation (digital forensics/cybercrime investigation)
  systematically identifies, preserves, analyzes, and presents digital evidence for prosecution. Key concepts: Cybersecurity
  incident (jeopardizes CIA triad, NIST); Digital forensics (gather/preserve evidence); Computer-targeted crime (hacking,
  malware, phishing, ransomware); Evidence preservation (chain-of-custody). Standards: NIST SP 800-61r3 (''Incident Response
  Recommendations... CSF 2.0 Community Profile'') integrates IR into CSF 2.0 functions (Govern: oversight; Identify: risks;
  Protect: safeguards; Detect: anomalies; Respond: containment; Recover: restoration), mapping forensics to Respond/Recover.
  Digital forensics phases: 1. Identification (detect incident), 2. Preservation (hashing, write-blockers), 3. Collection
  (imaging), 4. Examination (recover data), 5. Analysis (timeline, IOCs), 6. Presentation (court-ready report). Real-world:
  WannaCry (EternalBlue analysis), Sony hack. Ethics: Keyloggers balance privacy/safety. Sources: NIST SP 800-61r3 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r3.pdf);
  NIST CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework); ISO 27037 (forensics guidelines).


  Prior Knowledge: Basic cybersecurity incidents/threats (NIST), general IR.
