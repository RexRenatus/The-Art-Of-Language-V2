active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how the SolarWinds supply chain attack highlights failures in contractual
    requirements (e.g., SR-3 controls). What preventive measures could NIST SP 800-53 SA-4 have enforced in vendor contracts?
    Support with evidence from NIST sources.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    ''CSF only'' ignoring SP 800-53); 3) Real-world misapplications (e.g., SolarWinds as ''insider threat'' not supply chain);
    4) Partial truths (e.g., correct family but wrong control). Ensure 70% plausibility to challenge learners.'
