active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group, debate whether verbal jokes constitute harassment or require contextual analysis, using EEOC
    standards on severe/pervasive conduct. Consider cybersecurity angles like chat logs as evidence.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: Generate 2-3 distractors that are plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse subjective/objective
    standards; overlook digital chain of custody; mix quid pro quo with hostile environment). Ensure they test nuance without
    being obvious. Base on research context (EEOC errors, category mismatches).

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards covering the full topic, optimized for spaced repetition (Anki-style). Ensure even distribution:
  20% Layer 1 (Foundation), 25% Layer 2 (Components), 30% Layer 3 (Implementation), 25% Layer 4 (Integration). Align 1/3 to
  each Bloom''s cluster: Remember/Understand (basic recall/definition), Apply/Analyze (processes/comparisons with digital
  evidence), Evaluate/Create (scenarios/plans with cyber ties).


  Incorporate research: EEOC definitions (harassment on protected characteristics: race/color/religion/sex/national origin/age/disability/genetic;
  hostile environment severe/pervasive subjective/objective; quid pro quo employment decisions); SHRM steps; digital evidence
  (emails/logs, chain of custody, cyber-harassment); employer liability; retaliation risks. Sources: eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-harassment-workplace,
  SHRM.org.


  Use exact schema:

  [JSON array of flashcards, each with ''front'', ''back'' {answer, explanation, distractors[array], references[string]},
  ''metadata'' {bloom_level, layer, type}]


  Enhance pedagogy: Front prompts active recall (e.g., ''Define...'', ''Steps to...'', ''Compare...'', ''Evaluate this plan...'').
  Backs scaffold from simple to complex. Distractors per protocol. Tie to cybersecurity (digital forensics, secure handling).
  Vary types: 40% cloze deletions, 30% MCQ (4 options), 20% short answer, 10% scenario.


  Output ONLY valid JSON array, no extra text.'
