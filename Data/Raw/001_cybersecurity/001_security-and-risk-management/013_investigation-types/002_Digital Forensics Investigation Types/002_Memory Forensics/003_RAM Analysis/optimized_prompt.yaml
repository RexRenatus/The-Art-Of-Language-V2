  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the following: ''In what real-world incident response scenarios (e.g.,
    ransomware attack with wiped disks) is RAM analysis indispensable, and what risks arise if it is overlooked? Support with
    examples from NIST SP 800-86 or known cases like the SolarWinds breach.'' Encourage critical thinking by requiring participants
    to cite pros/cons and propose alternatives.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Digital Forensics > Memory
  Forensics > RAM Analysis (hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Investigation Types > Digital Forensics
  Investigation Types > Memory Forensics > RAM Analysis). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet using
  university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (mix levels), active learning (prompt recall/application), scaffolding (tag by layer),
  and spaced repetition best practices.


  CRITICAL CONTEXT (voter-corrected accuracy): RAM Analysis = forensic analysis of volatile RAM dumps for artifacts like running
  processes, network connections, malware, encryption keys (NOT RAMS from systems engineering). Key tools: Volatility (plugins:
  pslist, netscan, malfind), acquisition (DumpIt, FTK Imager). Standards: NIST SP 800-86, ACPO. Artifacts: processes/modules/kernel
  objects/keys. Importance: Captures ephemeral evidence in incident response.
