  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the proposition: ''Embedded system forensics requires fundamentally different skills and tools
    than traditional digital forensics.'' Use examples from IoT devices (e.g., routers) and ICS (e.g., automotive ECUs) to
    support your arguments, addressing challenges like RTOS analysis and firmware extraction.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

  **Comprehensive Topic Content** (Web-grounded, completed per voter requests):

  Embedded system forensics acquires, preserves, and analyzes evidence from resource-constrained devices (IoT, OT/ICS, automotive
  ECUs). Challenges: No UI, proprietary firmware/RTOS (VxWorks/QNX), real-time constraints.

  - **Sources** (full list): SWGDE ''Best Practices for Forensic Examination of Embedded Devices'' (swgde.org/documents);
  Mandiant ''OT Incident Response Framework'' (mandiant.com/resources); NIST SP 800-86/800-82; Tools: Binwalk, Ghidra.


  **Learning Objectives** (Bloom''s Taxonomy):

  1. REMEMBER: Define key terms...

  **Concept Map**: Central ''Embedded System Forensics'' → Firmware Analysis (Binwalk), RTOS (VxWorks), OT/ICS → SWGDE Competencies
  → Mandiant DFIR (OEM collaboration).


  **Flashcard Generation Instructions**:

  - Generate exactly 50 flashcards covering all objectives, layers, and active learning themes.

  - Use schema: [full flashcard_schema from above].

  - Ensure variety: 20 Q&A, 20 MCQ, 10 T/F.

  - High pedagogy: Active recall, spaced repetition-friendly, misconception-busting.

  - Output ONLY a JSON array of objects: [{''id'':1, ''type'':''Q&A|MCQ|T/F'', ''front'':''...'', ''back'':{''answer'':''...'',
  ''explanation'':''...'', ''bloom_level'':''...'', ''layer'':1-4, ''tags'':[''...'']}, ... }]
