active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: Students pair up; one uses Wireshark to demonstrate capturing and filtering a PCAP for suspicious traffic
    (e.g., C2 communication in malware), explaining steps aloud. The partner teaches back by diagramming protocol headers
    (IP/TCP) and anomalies observed. Switch roles and provide peer feedback on clarity.
  problem_solving: Provide a sample PCAP file with simulated malware data exfiltration (e.g., via DNS tunneling). In small
    teams, analyze it to identify source/destination IPs, protocols (e.g., unusual UDP), payload anomalies, and recommend
    forensic reporting steps, including timeline reconstruction and evidence chain-of-custody.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Packet Capture (PCAP) Analysis
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Investigation Types > Digital Forensics > Network Forensics
  > PCAP Analysis).


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards (5 per Bloom''s level: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create) optimized
  for Anki/spaced repetition. Cover all scaffolding layers progressively, integrate prior knowledge (OSI/TCP/IP), complete
  sections (performance monitoring: anomalous flows; components: headers/protocols; implementation: Wireshark steps; integration:
  IDS/IPS).


  Incorporate research context: PCAP captures packets (headers + payload) for incident analysis (malware, DoS/DDoS, unauthorized
  access); tools like Wireshark in promiscuous mode; files .pcap/.pcapng.
