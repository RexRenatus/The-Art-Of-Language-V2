active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical and legal implications of recovering deleted social media posts
    without a warrant. Use real-world examples (e.g., criminal investigations vs. civil disputes) to argue for or against
    proactive OSINT techniques like Wayback Machine checks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the full list from ''learning_objectives'' above].

  - Active Learning: Tie cards to discussion (ethical debates), peer teaching (method explanations), problem-solving (scenarios).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers: [Insert full scaffolding descriptions above].


  Generate accurate content based on social media forensics best practices (ignore unrelated NIST sanitization; focus on recovery
  techniques): browser cache analysis, SQLite DB extraction from apps (Twitter/Instagram), server-side logs/backups (via warrants),
  API scraping, external archives (Wayback Machine, Google Cache), tools (Autopsy for carving, Magnet AXIOM for artifacts),
  challenges (encryption, policies), legal (chain of custody), platforms (Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram), case studies.


  Use Flashcard Schema: [Insert full schema above]. Output a JSON array of 50 flashcards, each as specified. Ensure high pedagogical
  value: progressive difficulty per Bloom''s, realistic distractors, web-grounded (e.g., ''Autopsy recovers SQLite artifacts
  per SANS forensics guidelines''). Group by Bloom''s level and scaffolding layer in metadata.'
