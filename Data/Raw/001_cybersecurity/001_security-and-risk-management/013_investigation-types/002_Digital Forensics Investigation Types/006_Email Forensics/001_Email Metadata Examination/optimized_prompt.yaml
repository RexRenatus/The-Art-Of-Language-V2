active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent can email metadata be trusted in a forensic investigation? Debate using examples of spoofing
    techniques versus authentication protocols like SPF/DKIM/DMARC, considering real-world limitations such as MTA modifications
    and incomplete implementations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Received headers are in
    chronological order'' instead of reverse), 2) Partial truth (e.g., lists some but not all header types), 3) Opposite or
    unrelated (e.g., confuses envelope with body content). Ensure distractors test subtle distinctions from research context.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Email Metadata Examination
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Investigation Types > Digital Forensics Investigation Types
  > Email Forensics > Email Metadata Examination).


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards (15 basic Q&A, 15 MCQs) covering all Bloom''s levels and scaffolding layers. Ensure
  even distribution: 25% Layer 1 (Foundation: definitions, SMTP/MIME prereqs, purpose like spoofing detection), 25% Layer
  2 (Components: headers categories per RFC 9787, envelope vs. headers, Received paths), 25% Layer 3 (Implementation: extraction/parsing/validation
  steps, tools like Wireshark/MX Toolbox), 25% Layer 4 (Integration: correlation with logs, incident response).


  Incorporate research: Email metadata = headers (structural: MIME-Version/Content-Type; user-facing: From/To/Subject; non-structural:
  List-*/Resent-*) + envelope (SMTP MAIL FROM/RCPT TO). Purpose: spoofing detection, path tracing, SPF/DKIM/DMARC verification,
  chain of custody.


  Learning Objectives: [Insert full list from JSON]. Active Learning: Use concepts from discussion (trust/spoofing), peer
  teaching (header diffs), problem-solving (phishing analysis).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"type": "basic"|"multiple_choice", "bloom_level": "REMEMBER"|etc., "scaffolding_layer":
  1|2|3|4, "front": "...", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "links": ["Objective index", "Hierarchy path"]}}.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: Basic = Q/A+exp; MCQ = Q w/ A/B/C/D + correct+exp w/ distractor rationale. Distractors:
  misconceptions/partial/opposites. Explanations: <100 words, cite RFC 9787/SMTP.'
