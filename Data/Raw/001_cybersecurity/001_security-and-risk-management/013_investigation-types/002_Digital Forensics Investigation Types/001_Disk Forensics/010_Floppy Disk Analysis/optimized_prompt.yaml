    still support floppy disk analysis in 2024? Consider costs, obsolescence risks, real-world incidents (e.g., legacy nuclear
    systems), and cybersecurity implications. Provide evidence-based arguments for both sides.'

    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse bit rot with physical damage), 2)
      Partial truth (e.g., correct tool but wrong step), 3) Extreme/unrealistic (e.g., outdated tool like ancient software).'
    - Base on real errors from forensics (e.g., writing to original disk), voter priorities, or research context.
    - Ensure distractors test deeper understanding (e.g., mix up FAT12 with NTFS for floppies).

  **Completed Research Context:** [Insert full context here]

  Floppy Disk: Thin flexible magnetic medium in plastic enclosure (3.5" standard: 1.44MB). Components: Housing, iron oxide-coated
  disk, hub, shutter, spring, write-protect tab, read/write heads, stepper motor. Functionality: Magnetize tracks/sectors
  for direct access.

  Digital Preservation: Transfer to modern formats. Disk Imaging: Bit-for-bit copy (e.g., dd, KryoFlux). Bit Rot: Magnetic
  decay. Obsolescence: Rare FDDs/software.

  NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 2 (Guidelines for Media Sanitization, 2020): Clear (overwrite), Purge (degauss/destruct), Destroy; adapt
  for forensics preservation via imaging before sanitization. https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-88r2.

  Big Picture: Critical for legacy risk mgmt (e.g., US military nuclear systems using floppies until 2019+). Sources: NIST
