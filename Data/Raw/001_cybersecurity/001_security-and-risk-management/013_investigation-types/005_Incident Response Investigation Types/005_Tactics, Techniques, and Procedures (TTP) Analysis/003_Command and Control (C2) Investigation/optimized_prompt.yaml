active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the effectiveness of detecting LOTL-based C2 versus traditional malware C2 channels in an APT
    scenario, using real-world examples like SolarWinds (LOTL supply chain) or NotPetya (botnet C2). What trade-offs exist
    in terms of stealth vs. control, and how do frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK address these?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Related but incorrect terms (e.g., ''botnet'' vs. ''honeypot''), 3) Partial truths (e.g., LOTL as ''only for execution,
    not C2''), 4) Real-world distractors (e.g., benign traffic mimicking beacons). Ensure 1-2 distractors per card are ''near
    misses'' from research context.'

  Use this exact content structure:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the 6 objectives above]

  - Active Learning: Incorporate elements (e.g., reference discussion debates, peer quizzes, log analysis) into explanations.

  - Scaffolding: Generate flashcards proportionally across 4 layers: 25% Layer 1 (Foundation: basic terms), 25% Layer 2 (Components:
  flows/frameworks), 25% Layer 3 (Implementation: procedures/NIST), 25% Layer 4 (Integration: MITRE/CTI/evasion). Ensure progression.

  - Research Context: Core defs (C2, server/client/agent/botnet/LOTL/Cyber Kill Chain/APT), NIST SP 800-61r3 (incident handling),
  SP 800-37r2 (risk mgmt), MITRE TA0011, examples (SolarWinds/NotPetya).


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (40 basic Q/A/cloze, 10 MCQs) covering all objectives/Bloom''s levels (at least 8 per
  level), layers, and active elements. Align to pedagogy: lower Bloom''s for Layer 1-2, higher for 3-4.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of objects: [{''id'':1, ''type'':''basic|mcq'', ''bloom_level'':''Remember|Understand|Apply|Analyze|Evaluate|Create'',
  ''scaffolding_layer'':1-4, ''front'':''Question text'', ''back'':''Answer + Explanation (1-2 sentences, ref objective/layer/active
  tie-in, e.g., "Links to problem-solving: Analyze PCAPs per NIST." + Reference (MITRE/NIST))'', ''distractors'':[''A'',''B'',''C'']
  for MCQs}]. No extra text. Ensure distractors follow protocol: plausible, misconceptions, near-misses.'
