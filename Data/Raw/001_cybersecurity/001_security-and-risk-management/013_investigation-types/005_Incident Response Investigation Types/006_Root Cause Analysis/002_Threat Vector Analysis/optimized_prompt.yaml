active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a corporate environment, debate which threat vector (e.g., phishing vs. supply chain attacks like
    SolarWinds) poses the greatest risk and why, considering the NIST CSF Identify function and real-world impact on incident
    response.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
