  discussion_prompt: 'Analyze the Enron scandal as a real-world eDiscovery case: Was spoliation effectively prevented? Debate
    intentional vs. negligent spoliation, misconceptions (e.g., assuming it''s always deliberate), and propose alternatives
    using chain of custody principles from NIST SP 800-86. Reference Legal Hold Investigation as a prerequisite.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Related but incorrect term (e.g., ''Preservation'' vs. ''Chain of Custody''); 3) Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g.,
    ''Use antivirus'' instead of ''write-blockers''). Ensure distractors test Bloom''s level and layer-specific knowledge.'

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Active Learning: [insert summaries of discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving].

  - Scaffolding: Generate 20-30 flashcards distributed across 4 layers: Layer 1 (5 cards, foundation), Layer 2 (5, components),
  Layer 3 (10, implementation), Layer 4 (5-10, integration). Tag each with layer/Bloom level.

  - Ensure coverage: 30% Remember/Understand, 40% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate/Create.

  - Best Practices: Legal holds, write-blockers, chain of custody checklists.


  Use exact Flashcard Schema:

  [insert full schema above]. Vary types: 40% MCQ, 20% Basic, 20% Cloze, 20% Application.


  Output ONLY as JSON array of flashcards: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''1'', ''bloom'':
  ''Remember'', ''reference'': ''...''}]. No extra text. Make educational, precise, and engaging.'
