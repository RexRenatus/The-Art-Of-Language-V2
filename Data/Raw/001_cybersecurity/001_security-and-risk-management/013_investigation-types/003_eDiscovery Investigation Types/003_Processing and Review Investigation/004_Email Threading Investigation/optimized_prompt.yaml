active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the role of email threading in uncovering hidden communications during a phishing investigation—how
    might missing threads alter investigative conclusions? Debate the effectiveness of TLS versus end-to-end encryption (E2E)
    in preserving thread integrity.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    truth (e.g., ''SPF verifies content integrity'' – actually sender domain), 3) Unrelated/plausible alternative (e.g., ''Uses
    Subject line for threading'' instead of References). Ensure distractors are realistic based on research context and voter-noted
    pitfalls like confusing TLS/E2E.'

  Incorporate this optimized content:

  - **Research Context**: Email Threading (organizing via In-Reply-To/References); E2E Encryption (S/MIME/PGP, RFC 9787);
  TLS (server transit, NIST SP 800-45); Authentication (SPF: authorized servers; DKIM: signatures; DMARC: policies; M3AAWG
  Best Practices); Cryptographic Envelope (E2E encrypted container for content/attachments/headers).

  - **Learning Objectives**: [insert full array from above].

  - **Scaffolding**: [insert full 4 layers from above].

  - **Active Learning**: [insert full activities from above] – reference in explanations.


  **Generation Rules**:

  - Cover all Bloom''s levels proportionally (40% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate/Create).

  - 60% multiple-choice (4 options), 20% cloze deletion (headers/processes), 10% short answer, 10% diagram-based (describe
  visuals).

  - Span all 4 scaffolding layers.

  - Use Flashcard Schema: [insert full schema from above].

  - Ensure completeness: Include tools (Relativity, Nuix), risks (broken threads, spoofing), prior links (email structure,
  forensics).

  - Output as JSON array: [{''id'':1, ''bloom_level'':''Remember'', ''scaffolding_layer'':1, ''front'':''...'', ''back'':{...}},
  ...].

  - Make engaging, precise, measurable; no fluff.'
