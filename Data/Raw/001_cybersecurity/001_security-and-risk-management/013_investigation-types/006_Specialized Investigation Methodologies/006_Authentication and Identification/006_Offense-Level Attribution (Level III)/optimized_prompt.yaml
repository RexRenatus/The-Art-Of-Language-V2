active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the challenges in achieving Level III attribution in a real-world breach like SolarWinds (attributed
    to APT29). Debate whether high-confidence attribution is worth the intelligence effort, referencing the Unit 42 framework's
    minimum standards, Admiralty scoring, and integration with the Diamond Model.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Topic Hierarchy:** Level 1: Cybersecurity | Level 2: Security And Risk Management | Level 3: Investigation Types | Level
  4: Specialized Investigation Methodologies | Level 5: Authentication and Identification | Level 6: Offense-Level Attribution
  (Level III).


  **Research Context (Completed):** Offense-level attribution (Level III) identifies specific threat actors/groups (e.g.,
  APT29). Levels: I (Activity Clusters: IoCs/TTPs grouping), II (Temporary Threat Groups: single actor tracking), III (Named
  Actors/Countries: high-confidence). Unit 42 Framework (Palo Alto): Minimum standards via multi-pivot evidence (IoCs, TTPs,
  victimology, timing). Diamond Model: Intrusion analysis via adversary-infrastructure-capability-victim relationships/pivots
  for attribution. Admiralty Scoring: A1 (near certain) to F3 (very speculative). Motivations: CRI (Cybercrime/Ransomware),
  STA (State-sponsored), MIX (Mixed). Examples: SolarWinds (APT29 via TTPs/IoCs). Sources: Unit 42 Reports (Palo Alto), Diamond
  Model paper (Caltagirone et al.), MITRE ATT&CK, FireEye/Mandiant attribution reports.


  **Prior Knowledge:** Builds on Level I (IoC/TTP clustering) and Level II (operation tracking).

  ''#1-6''}. Ensure variety, measurability, and no policy violations. Prioritize active recall, plausible distractors, and
  pedagogical depth.'
