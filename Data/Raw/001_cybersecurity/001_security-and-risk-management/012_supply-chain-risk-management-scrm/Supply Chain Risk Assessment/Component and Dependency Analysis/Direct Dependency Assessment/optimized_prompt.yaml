  discussion_prompt: 'In the context of the SolarWinds supply chain attack, debate the following: ''Direct dependencies pose
    higher risks than transitive ones because organizations have more control over them.'' Use evidence from Log4j and NIST
    CSF 2.0 to support or refute, considering challenges in SBOM adoption.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Direct deps are always
    transitive''), 2) Partial truth (e.g., ''SBOM only lists vulns'' vs full inventory), 3) Extreme/opposite (e.g., ''No need
    for SBOM in assessment''). Base on real errors from case studies (Log4j confusion), standards (misquote NIST), or examples
    (swap direct/transitive).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university pedagogy (Bloom''s
  Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 25-35 high-quality flashcards for ''Direct Dependency Assessment'' (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) > Supply Chain Risk Assessment
  > Component and Dependency Analysis > Direct Dependency Assessment). Consensus: 100% voter approval.


  **Content Summary (Web-grounded, complete):** Direct dependency assessment identifies/evaluates software components directly
  relied upon (vs. transitive: deps of deps). Types: static/dynamic/remote/provided (CISA SBOM Framing). SBOM: machine-readable
  inventory (SPDX/CycloneDX) for transparency (EO 14028). C-SCRM: NIST SP 800-161r1. NIST CSF 2.0: GV.OC Supply Chain Risk.
  Tools: Syft, Trivy. Cases: SolarWinds (direct tampered update), Log4j (transitive vuln spread). Bitsight.com: Vendor risk
  scoring for deps. Big Picture: Prevents supply chain attacks, ensures compliance/mastery. Prior Knowledge: Software packages
  (npm/pip), basic SCRM.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives from above].

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers from above].

  **Active Learning:** [Insert the 3 activities from above] - Weave hooks into explanations.


  **Generate flashcards per exact schema:** [Insert full flashcard_schema from above]. Cover all Bloom''s levels (proportional),
  layers (Layer1:30%,2:25%,3:25%,4:20%), objectives. Variety: 70% MCQ (4 options), 20% Short Answer (precise recall/apply),
  10% Cloze (understand gaps). Use examples/SBOM excerpts/cases. Ensure measurable, engaging (scenarios), educational (explanations
  build scaffolding). No duplicates; optimize for Anki/Quizlet import.'
