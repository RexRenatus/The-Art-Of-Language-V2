active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the differences between harmful functional duplication (e.g., tool sprawl
    post-merger) and beneficial intentional redundancy (e.g., failover systems). Use real-world examples from supply chain
    ecosystems and reference NIST SP 800-53 controls like SA-4 to evaluate when duplication becomes a risk—aim for consensus
    on assessment thresholds.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: '3 distractors per MCQ, plausible via: 1. Common misconception (e.g., ''Functional duplication is always
    beneficial redundancy''), 2. Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Only applies to hardware''), 3. Related but incorrect
    term/context (e.g., confuse with ''vulnerability duplication''). Ensure one distractor is a ''trap'' from research/voter
    notes (e.g., NIST control misattribution).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Supply Chain Risk Management
  (SCRM). Topic: Functional Duplication Assessment (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > SCRM > Supply
  Chain Risk Assessment > Component and Dependency Analysis > Functional Duplication Assessment). Voter Consensus: 68.6% approval
  (7 voters) on pedagogy/completeness.


  Incorporate this optimized structure:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Active Learning: Use for inspiration (e.g., scenario-based Qs from problem-solving).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers [insert full details above]; tag each.

  - Research Context: Definitions (Functional Duplication: overlapping entities; etc.), NIST CSF 2.0 GOVERN, SP 800-53 Rev5
  (SA-4 Acquisition, SA-8 Engineering Principles, SA-10 Config Mgmt), big picture (reduce attack surface/costs).

  - Misconceptions: Duplication ≠ intentional redundancy.


  Generate flashcards per schema [insert full schema above]. Ensure university pedagogy: Bloom''s progression, active recall,
  spaced repetition-friendly. 60% higher-order (Apply+), web-grounded (cite NIST), distractors from voters/research. Output
  ONLY the JSON array of flashcards, no extra text.'
