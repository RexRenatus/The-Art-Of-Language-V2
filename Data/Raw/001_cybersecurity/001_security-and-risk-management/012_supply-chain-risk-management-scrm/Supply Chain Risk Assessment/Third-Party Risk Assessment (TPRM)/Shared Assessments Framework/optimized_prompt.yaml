active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs of using the Shared Assessments Framework versus custom TPRM assessments in resource-constrained
    organizations. Cite recent supply chain breaches like SolarWinds and discuss how the framework's SIG Questionnaire and
    CAP could mitigate similar risks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Supply Chain Risk Management

  Incorporate this research context: Shared Assessments is an industry-led program for standardizing TPRM via SIG Questionnaires
  (Core/Light/Vertical for info gathering), CAP (platform for assessments/sharing), and Maturity Model. Aligns with ISO 27001/27002
  (ISMS), NIST CSF 2.0 (risk management), NIST SP 800-53 (controls), 800-171 (CUI), 800-161r1 (SCRM), Privacy Framework, CMMC
  (DoD maturity levels 1-5). Sources: https://sharedassessments.org/ (SIG/CAP), https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework (CSF),
