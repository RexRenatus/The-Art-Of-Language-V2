active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the most critical attack vector for supply chain risks (e.g., software
    updates vs. hardware tampering) using real-world examples like SolarWinds or Log4j. Evaluate how these vectors impact
    the CIA triad and propose mitigations, citing MITRE ATT&CK TTPs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Related but incorrect term (e.g., ''vulnerability'' vs. ''attack vector''), 3) Supply chain distractor (e.g., mix traditional
    vs. SCRM-specific TTP). Ensure distractors are realistic from research context.'

  Use this comprehensive content:

  [Insert full Research Context: Complete MITRE ATT&CK details - TTPs: Tactics (high-level adversary goals, e.g., Initial
  Access), Techniques (specific methods, e.g., Supply Chain Compromise), Procedures (implementations). Sources: MITRE.org/attack.
  Supply chain examples: SolarWinds (T1195), Log4j, NotPetya. Integrate SCRM: SBOM, vendor risks.]


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste all 6 objectives].

  - Scaffolding Layers: Generate 12-25 flashcards per layer (Layer 1 Foundation, Layer 2 Components, Layer 3 Implementation,
  Layer 4 Integration). Tag each with layer and Bloom''s level.

  - Active Learning: Infuse real-world scenarios from activities into scenario-based cards.

  - Concept Map: Reference in explanations.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: Q&A, MC (with distractor protocol), Fill-in-Blank. Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''mc|qa|fib'',
  ''layer'': 1-4, ''blooms_level'': ''Remember'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...''}]. Ensure progressive complexity,
  voter priorities (completeness, supply chain examples), and pedagogy (measurable, active). No duplicates; high-quality,
  exam-ready.'
