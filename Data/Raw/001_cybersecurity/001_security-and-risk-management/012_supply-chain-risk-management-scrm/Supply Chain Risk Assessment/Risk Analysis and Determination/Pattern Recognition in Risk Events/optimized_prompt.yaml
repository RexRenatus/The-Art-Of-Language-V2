active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Analyze the SolarWinds supply chain attack as a case study. What patterns in TTPs and IoCs were present
    (e.g., tampered vendor updates), and how could early recognition have altered outcomes? Debate the balance between pattern
    detection automation and human analysis in SCRM.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
