  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste the full learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: Use discussion on Log4Shell, peer teaching on formats, problem-solving with tools like Syft.

  - Scaffolding: Layer 1 Foundation (definitions, prior knowledge from package managers), Layer 2 Components (NTIA elements,
  SPDX/CycloneDX), Layer 3 Implementation (tools: Syft, SPDX generators), Layer 4 Integration (vuln scanning, compliance).

  - Key Facts: Component Name: Supplier namespace e.g., ''Acme:SecurityModule'' (CISA). Version: Semantic e.g., 1.2.3. SBOM:
  Machine-readable inventory (NTIA).
