  Chain Security > Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF).


  **Topic Context & Content (Web-Grounded Research & Voter Consensus):**

  - Core Concepts: Executable code testing verifies compiled/running software for vulnerabilities/malicious code; key terms:
  vulnerability (weakness exploitable for CIA compromise), software assurance (confidence in secure function), SDLC (full
  lifecycle).

  - Standards: NIST SP 800-218 (SSDF v1.1, PW.8: Perform testing incl. dynamic/automated scanning, fuzzing, IAST; https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-218);
  NISTIR 8397 (vuln. mgmt.; https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8397); OWASP WSTG (testing guide; https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/).

  - Best Practices (NIST PW.8): Automated vuln scanning of executables; dynamic testing (DAST); interactive (IAST); fuzzing;
  SBOM validation; CI/CD integration; measure coverage/reduce false positives.


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s):** [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE] - Ensure even coverage.

  **Active Learning:** [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE] - Link cards where relevant.


  **Output Schema:** Strictly JSON array of 60 flashcards following [FLASHCARD_GENERATION_SCHEMA]. Front = question/options;
  Back = answer + explanation + links. Ensure completeness (all best practices/sources), engagement (distractors spark debate),
  no repetition. Prioritize voter suggestions: explicit Bloom''s, 4-layer scaffold, discussions/problems.'
