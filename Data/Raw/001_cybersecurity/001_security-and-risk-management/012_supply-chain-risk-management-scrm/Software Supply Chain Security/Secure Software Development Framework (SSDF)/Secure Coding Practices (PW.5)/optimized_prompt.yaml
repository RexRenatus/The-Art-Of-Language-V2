active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between implementing comprehensive secure coding practices (e.g., full OWASP checklist)
    and development speed in agile environments. Use real-world examples like the Log4Shell vulnerability to challenge the
    misconception that 'security slows down development'. What strategies can mitigate these trade-offs while managing supply
    chain risks?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student teaches a partner an OWASP secure coding practice (e.g., input validation or output
    encoding), including common pitfalls. Switch roles and use a teach-back quiz where the learner explains the practice back
    and identifies errors in a flawed example.
  problem_solving: 'Provide a real-world code snippet with a SQL injection vulnerability (e.g., unsanitized user input in
    a web app query). Students must: 1) Identify the vulnerability, 2) Fix it using prepared statements/parameterized queries,
    3) Test the fix, and 4) Discuss how this applies to supply chain risks like tainted third-party dependencies.'
