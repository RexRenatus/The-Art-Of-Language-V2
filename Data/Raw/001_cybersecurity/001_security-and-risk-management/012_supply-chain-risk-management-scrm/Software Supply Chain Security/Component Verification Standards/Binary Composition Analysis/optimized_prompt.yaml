active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given recent supply chain attacks like SolarWinds or Log4j, debate the effectiveness of binary composition
    analysis using static vs. dynamic methods. What are the trade-offs in accuracy, speed, and resource use? Support your
    arguments with examples from industry standards (e.g., NIST SP 800-218) and real-world cases, addressing common misconceptions
    about analysis limitations.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains static binary analysis (e.g., patterns, signatures, tools like IDA Pro) while
    the partner takes notes and asks clarifying questions; then switch roles for dynamic analysis and reverse engineering.
    Conclude with a teach-back where each summarizes the partner's topic and connects it to SBOM generation.
  problem_solving: Using a safe sample binary from open datasets (e.g., via VirusTotal or FLARE datasets), apply tools like
    'strings', Binwalk, or Ghidra to perform composition analysis. Identify embedded libraries, potential vulnerabilities,
    and generate a basic SBOM. Discuss findings in the context of verifying third-party components for SCRM risks, simulating
    a real-world supply chain verification scenario.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom''s Taxonomy, active
  learning, and scaffolding. Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on ''Binary Composition Analysis'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > Security And Risk Management > Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) > Software Supply Chain Security > Component Verification
  Standards > Binary Composition Analysis).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: [reference discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving for context in explanations]

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers – ~12 per layer: Layer 1 Foundation (basic terms: binary code, SSCS,
  SBOM), Layer 2 Components (static/dynamic/reverse methods, standards like NIST SP 800-218/800-161, OWASP SCA, SLSA), Layer
  3 Implementation (tools: Ghidra, IDA Pro, Binwalk, strings; procedures), Layer 4 Integration (SCRM workflows, SBOM gen,
  SolarWinds/Log4j examples).

  - Research Context: Binary analysis examines executables for components/risks without source code; key for SSCS; methods
  include static/dynamic/complex analysis.

  - Prior Knowledge: Builds on SCRM basics/SBOM/malware analysis.

  - Big Picture: Critical for supply chain attacks detection.


  Use the exact Flashcard Schema: Output a JSON array of objects, each {''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''correct_answer'':
  ''...'', ''distractors'': [...], ''explanation'': ''...''}}. Ensure coverage: 40% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 30% APPLY/ANALYZE,
  30% EVALUATE/CREATE. Vary question types (definitional, comparative, applicative, evaluative). Distractors per protocol.
  Explanations detailed and pedagogical.'
