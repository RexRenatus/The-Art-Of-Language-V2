active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, analyze how a golden repository could have prevented or mitigated the SolarWinds
    supply chain attack. Prioritize 3-5 controls (e.g., artifact signing, SCA integration) and debate their feasibility in
    an OSS context, linking to CIA triad principles and NIST SP 800-161r1.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university pedagogy (Bloom''s
  Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on ''Golden Repository Management'' (Topic

  **Full Topic Context (Synthesized from NIST SP 800-161r1, CSF 2.0, voter consensus, web research):** Golden Repository Management:
  Secure central repo as ''single source of truth'' for approved OSS artifacts (code/binaries/images/configs). Mitigates supply
  chain attacks (SolarWinds: tampered Orion; Log4j: OSS vuln). NIST SP 800-161r1 CM-8: ''Maintaining accurate inventory facilitated
  by golden repository.'' Prior: Git/VCS, SDLC, CIA (integrity). Tools: Git, JFrog Artifactory, SCA (Snyk), SBOM (Syft), signing
  (GPG). Best practices: RBAC, versioning, CI/CD gates.

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste the scaffolding object above]

  - Active Learning: [reference activities in explanations]


  **Output Schema:** Strictly JSON array of 50 flashcards matching ''flashcard_schema'' above. Ensure coverage: even Bloom''s/layer
  distribution, voter priorities (completeness: NIST/cases; pedagogy: objectives/scaffolding; tools/examples). Varied types,
  engaging, error-proof distractors. Sources: NIST SP 800-161r1 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/161/r1/final), CSF 2.0
