active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a supply chain context, debate whether access revocation should be immediate for terminated third-party
    vendors or delayed to allow knowledge transfer, considering SCRM risks and compliance with NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 AC-3(8).
    What are the trade-offs between security, audit preservation, automation vs. manual processes, and real-world compliance?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ flashcard based on common misconceptions: 1) Overly simplistic (e.g.,
    ''Always delete accounts immediately''), 2) Inverse/extreme (e.g., ''Delay revocation indefinitely''), 3) Confusable standard
    (e.g., mix CIS with unrelated NIST control). Ensure distractors are plausible from research context or voter-noted pitfalls
    like ignoring audit preservation.'

  **Content Knowledge (Complete Research Context):**

  - **Core Concepts:** Access revocation: withdrawing/disabling access rights triggered by termination, role change, incidents.
  Key: Disable (not delete) to preserve audits. Protects CIA triad.

  - **Standards:** CIS CSC v8.1 6.2: Automated process to revoke access immediately upon termination/role change; disable
  accounts for audit trails. Aligns with NIST CSF v2.0.

  - **NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (Completed):** AC-2 Account Management: Requires revocation processes for terminated/changed users;
  enhancements include AC-2(2) automated management, AC-3(8) fine-grained revocation with supplemental guidance: ''Organizations
  define revocation timelines (e.g., within 24 hours), automate where feasible, monitor for compliance, and integrate with
  incident response to prevent unauthorized access post-termination.''

  - **SCRM Context:** Critical for third-party vendors; balances immediate security vs. knowledge transfer.


  **Pedagogical Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the 6 objectives from above].

  - Scaffolding: Generate flashcards across 4 layers [Insert scaffolding descriptions].

  - Active Learning Tie-Ins: Reference discussion (timing trade-offs), peer teaching (disable vs. delete), problem-solving
  (vendor breach case).

  - Prerequisites: Builds on basic access control/provisioning.


  **Output Format:** JSON array of flashcards. Each: {"id":1, "layer":"1", "blooms_level":"Remember", "front":"Question text",
  "back":{"answer":"...","explanation":"...","references":["CIS CSC 6.2"],"related_activity":"Peer teaching","distractors":["D1","D2","D3"]}}
  (omit distractors if not MCQ).


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following the schema: Varied types, distractors per protocol, comprehensive coverage.
  Ensure university-level rigor with active recall.'
