        "core_logic": "Linear filter pipelines (AC-4(28)) work by processing data sequentially through a series of filters, ensuring each filter is invoked and cannot be bypassed. This structured approach guarantees consistent policy enforcement, which is essential for reliable information flow control and risk management.",
