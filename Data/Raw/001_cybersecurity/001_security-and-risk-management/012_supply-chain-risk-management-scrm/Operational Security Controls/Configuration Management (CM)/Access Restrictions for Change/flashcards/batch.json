        "core_logic": "The Configuration Management (CM) family, particularly controls like CM-3 (Configuration Change Control) and CM-4 (Impact Analyses), is designed to manage changes systematically because uncontrolled modifications can lead to security vulnerabilities and operational disruptions. This family works by establishing policies and procedures for proposing, approving, implementing, and documenting all changes to system configurations.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors represent related but distinct control families: AC focuses on authorization, SI on maintaining system integrity, and IR on responding to incidents. CM is the family specifically dedicated to the management of system configurations and changes.",
        "analogy": "Think of the Configuration Management family as the 'building code' and 'construction management' for your IT systems; it ensures that any modifications or upgrades are done according to established procedures and safety standards, preventing structural issues or security breaches."
