  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether logical or physical access restrictions are more critical for preventing
    tampering in supply chain changes, using NIST CM-5 examples. Consider trade-offs in agile DevOps environments and real-world
    cases like SolarWinds.
  peer_teaching: 'Pair up: Student A explains CM-5(1)-(3) [CM-5(1): Define/document restrictions; CM-5(2): Implement automated
    enforcement; CM-5(3): Review/approve changes] to Student B using a diagram, then B teaches back with a real-world example
    like SolarWinds supply chain compromise.'
  problem_solving: Design a workflow for approving a software update in a simulated enterprise environment, enforcing least
    privilege (AC-6), auditing changes, and CM-5 restrictions. Test for vulnerabilities such as unauthorized firmware modifications.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST-aligned content. Generate
  a deck of 50 high-quality flashcards on ''Access Restrictions for Change'' (Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management
  > Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) > Operational Security Controls > Configuration Management (CM) > Access Restrictions
  for Change).


  **Context and Pedagogy:**

  - Use provided learning objectives, active learning activities, 4-layer scaffolding (including prior knowledge, big picture,
  misconceptions), and topic hierarchy.

  - Align cards to Bloom''s Taxonomy: 20% Remember/Understand (Layer 1-2), 30% Apply/Analyze (Layer 2-3), 30% Evaluate (Layer
  3), 20% Create (Layer 4).

  - Incorporate NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 CM-5 details: Define/document (CM-5(1)), automate (CM-5(2)), authorize/review (CM-5(3));
  links to AC-3, PE-3, AC-6.

  - Big picture: Prevents SolarWinds-like attacks, supports CIA integrity, zero-trust.

  - Distractors from listed misconceptions.
