active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Analyze the SolarWinds supply chain incident. In groups, debate what lessons learned should be documented
    for SCRM and IR, focusing on root causes (e.g., vendor vetting failures) and preventive measures (e.g., continuous monitoring).
    Address common misconceptions, such as 'lessons learned only apply to major incidents' or 'RCA is unnecessary for third-party
    risks.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    only for major incidents''); 2) Partial truths (e.g., confuses RCA with symptom fixing); 3) Framework mix-ups (e.g., NIST
    SP 800-30 as only preparation, not maintenance); 4) SCRM blind spots (e.g., ignores third-party risks). Ensure distractors
    are realistic for cybersecurity learners.'
