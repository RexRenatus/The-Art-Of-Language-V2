active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM), debate the trade-offs between detailed compliance
    reporting requirements (e.g., NIST CSF Govern function and metrics) and organizational agility. Use real-world examples
    like the SolarWinds supply chain breach or MOVEit vulnerability to argue whether over-reporting creates more risk than
    it mitigates, and propose balanced strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse CSF Tiers with functions; overstate
      compliance as security guarantee; mix ISO 27001 clauses with NIST).
    - Use partial truths (e.g., correct framework but wrong tier), real-world example twists (e.g., SolarWinds as 'internal'
      risk), or edge cases (e.g., ignore Govern in CSF 2.0).
    - Ensure 1-2 high-plausibility distractors to promote active recall/discrimination.
