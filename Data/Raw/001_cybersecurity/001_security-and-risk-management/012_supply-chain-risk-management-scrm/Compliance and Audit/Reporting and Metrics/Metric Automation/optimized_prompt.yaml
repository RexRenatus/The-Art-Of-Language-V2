active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM), debate the pros and cons of automating key security
    metrics (e.g., vendor compliance rates, third-party risk scores) versus manual collection. Reference NIST SP 800-55 guidelines
    and discuss potential impacts on decision-making, data accuracy, and resource allocation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use discussion/peer/problem-solving to inspire scenario-based cards.

  - Scaffolding: Build cards progressively (Layer 1 foundation to Layer 4 integration).

  - Research: Base on NIST SP 800-55 Rev. 1 (2008), Vol. 1 & 2: Guidance for security performance measurement (define objectives,
  select measures, automate collection/analysis/reporting). Tools: Splunk, ELK Stack, GRC, Tableau. Focus: Automating SCRM
  metrics (vendor compliance, risk scores) for accuracy/timeliness.

  - Prerequisites: Link to basic SCRM/security metrics.

  - Concept Map: Central ''Metric Automation'' → ''SCRM Metrics'', ''NIST SP 800-55'', ''Automation Tools'', ''Security Controls'',
  ''Reporting Dashboards''.


  Generate flashcards following EXACT schema: Output as JSON array of objects with fields: id, type (basic_qa/cloze_deletion/mcq_single/mcq_multiple),
  question, answer, bloom_level, scaffolding_layer, explanation, references, distractors (array or null).


  Distractor Protocol: [PASTE FULL FROM ABOVE]. Ensure 80-100 cards, balanced (20% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 40% APPLY/ANALYZE,
  40% EVALUATE/CREATE; 25% per layer). Questions use precise action verbs. Promote active learning: 30% scenario-based. High
  accuracy; cite sources. Avoid criminal/offensive content.'
