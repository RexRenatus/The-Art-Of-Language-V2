active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group, debate the materiality of a hypothetical supply chain cyber incident (e.g., compromised vendor
    software like SolarWinds). Use SEC guidelines on quantitative and qualitative factors to argue for or against immediate
    reporting under the 4-day disclosure rule. Consider impacts on shareholders and tie to SCRM risks.
  peer_teaching: Pair up; one student explains the role of NIST CSF 2.0 (e.g., Respond and Recover functions) in regulatory
    reporting, while the partner teaches it back using an SCRM example like a third-party vendor breach. Switch roles and
    discuss misconceptions.
  problem_solving: 'Analyze the real-world MOVEit breach case: Determine reporting obligations under SEC rules, assess materiality,
    and draft a sample outline for an SEC Form 8-K filing. Use think-pair-share to address misconceptions, such as confusing
    all incidents as reportable versus only material ones.'

    reportable'' vs. ''Only material''; confuse Threat vs. Incident; ignore qualitative factors; outdated timelines pre-2023).
    Ensure distractors are 70% semantically similar but factually wrong, drawing from research context and voter-noted misconceptions.'

  Use this exact content for generation:

  [Insert full scaffolding layers here, including definitions, frameworks, steps, integrations, concept map, and completed
  research/sources].


  Incorporate pedagogy: Align flashcards to 6 learning objectives [list them]. Embed active learning hooks (e.g., reference
  discussion on SolarWinds materiality in explanations).


  Generate flashcards following this schema exactly [insert full flashcard_schema above]. Ensure progressive complexity: Layer
  1 (Remember/Understand heavy), Layer 2 (Understand/Analyze), Layer 3 (Apply/Analyze), Layer 4 (Evaluate/Create).


  Voter priorities: Bloom''s progression, active elements, scaffolding logic, prior knowledge links, completeness (NIST SP
  800-61 Rev. 3: full incident handling guide).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''front'':..., ''back'':{''answer'':..., ''explanation'':..., ''references'':...},
  ''type'':..., ''layer'':..., ''bloom_level'':...}, ...]. No extra text. Ensure high-quality: Active recall, plausible distractors,
  university-level rigor.'
