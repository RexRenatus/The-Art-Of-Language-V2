active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between independent external audits and internal audits in supply chain risk management.
    Using the SolarWinds breach as a case study (where supply chain compromise evaded initial controls), argue whether full
    independence is always necessary or if cost savings from alternatives like continuous monitoring justify reduced external
    verification.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Full Research Context:**

  Independent audit verification: Objective examination of IS controls by external/independent party to assess design, implementation,
  operating effectiveness against criteria (e.g., FISCAM). IS Controls: IT-reliant (access, app, general). Deficiencies: Failures
  in preventing/detecting errors. Frameworks: FISCAM (GAO, aligns with Green Book 5 components + IT categories: Security Mgmt
  (SO), Access (AC), App Software (AS), Sys Software (SS), Operations (OP), Segregation (SD)). Phases: Planning (risk scope),
  Testing (walkthroughs, substantive tests), Reporting (opinions). SCRM Links: NIST 800-161, ISO 27001. Case: SolarWinds (2020
  supply chain attack via tampered updates, highlighting audit gaps).

  **Sources:** GAO FISCAM (2022 ed., gao.gov/assets/gao-22-105312.pdf); GAO Green Book (gao.gov/assets/gao-14-704g.pdf); NIST
  SP 800-53 Rev5 (nist.gov); NIST SP 800-161r1 (nist.gov); CISA SolarWinds Alert (cisa.gov); AICPA SOC 2 (aicpa.org).


  **Prior Knowledge:** Risk assessment, internal controls (COSO), compliance basics.

  **Big Picture:** Mitigates SCRM third-party risks for cybersecurity resilience.
