        {

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Understanding supply chain tiers is crucial because risks can propagate from sub-tier suppliers, and self-attestation can be extended to gather information about these deeper levels, because it helps map the extended supply chain. This provides a more comprehensive view of potential vulnerabilities beyond the immediate supplier relationship.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly define tiers by geography or criticality, and limit the application of self-attestation to only Tier 1 suppliers, failing to recognize its potential for mapping deeper supply chain risks.",

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The fundamental difference lies in the source of assurance: self-attestation is a supplier's internal claim, whereas certification involves an independent third-party audit, because this external validation provides a higher level of confidence. Therefore, certifications generally offer stronger assurance than self-attestations alone.",
