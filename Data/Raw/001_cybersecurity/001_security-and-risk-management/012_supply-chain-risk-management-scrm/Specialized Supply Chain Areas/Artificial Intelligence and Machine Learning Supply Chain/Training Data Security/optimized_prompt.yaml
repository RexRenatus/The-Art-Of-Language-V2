active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical and operational implications of undetected data poisoning in
    high-stakes AI applications (e.g., healthcare diagnostics). How does it link to CIA triad violations and broader SCRM?
    Support arguments with NIST AI RMF references.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    but incorrect concepts (e.g., availability for integrity threat); 3. Opposites/extremes (e.g., ''no validation needed'');
    4. Partial truths (e.g., NIST framework name wrong). Ensure no hints in distractors.'

  Incorporate these elements:

  - LEARNING OBJECTIVES: [paste the 6 objectives above].

  - SCAFFOLDING: [paste the 4 layers above].

  - ACTIVE LEARNING: Use concepts from activities to inspire scenario-based cards.

  - RESEARCH CONTEXT: Training data is foundational for AI; secure via CIA triad (Confidentiality: NIST SP 1800-28; Integrity:
  prevent poisoning/tampering; Availability: ensure access). Threats: Data poisoning (malicious corruption, e.g., Schmidt
  Sciences refs); Bias (unfair outcomes, NIST AI.100-1). NIST AI RMF (full: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.100-1.pdf):
  Govern (policies), Map (risks), Measure (bias/metrics), Manage (responses/mitigations). Best practices: Data sanitization,
  provenance tracking, secure sourcing, validation pipelines. Sources: NIST SP 1800-28 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1800-28.pdf),
  NIST AI RMF.

  - Prerequisites: CIA triad, SCRM basics.


  Generate flashcards using the exact FLASHCARD SCHEMA above. Ensure coverage: 6-8 cards per Bloom''s level, 6-9 per scaffolding
  layer, integrate voter priorities (e.g., measurable verbs, simulations in scenarios). Vary difficulty; align to pedagogy
  (active recall, spaced repetition). Output ONLY the JSON array of flashcards, no additional text.'
