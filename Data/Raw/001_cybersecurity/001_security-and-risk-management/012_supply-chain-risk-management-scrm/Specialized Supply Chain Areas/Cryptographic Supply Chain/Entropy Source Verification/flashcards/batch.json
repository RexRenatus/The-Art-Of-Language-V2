        "core_logic": "NIST SP 800-90B distinguishes between vetted and non-vetted conditioning components. Vetted components (like HMAC, CMAC) are pre-approved and simplify entropy assessment. Non-vetted components, however, demand significant effort from the submitter to provide mathematical proof of their effectiveness and minimal impact on entropy, making their validation process more complex.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The correct answer accurately highlights the key difference: the burden of proof for non-vetted components versus the pre-approval of vetted ones. Distractors incorrectly suggest non-vetted components are always insecure, have specific limitations, or are faster to validate, which misrepresents their role and validation requirements.",
        "analogy": "Using a vetted conditioning component is like using a certified, off-the-shelf part for a car; it's known to work and meets standards. Using a non-vetted component is like designing and building a custom part yourself – you need to provide detailed blueprints and test results to prove it's safe and effective."
