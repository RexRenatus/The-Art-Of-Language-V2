active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of supply chain risk management (SCRM), debate the trade-offs between using hardware-based
    RBGs (e.g., thermal noise sources) versus software-based ones for key generation. Consider factors like cost, security
    strength, entropy quality, and real-world examples of failures (e.g., Debian OpenSSL predictability bug or hardware backdoors).
    What recommendations would you make for vendor selection?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions: 1) Plausible but incorrect standard
    (e.g., ''SP 800-53'' instead of 800-133), 2) Under/overestimation (e.g., ''Software RNG always provides high entropy''),
    3) Confused concepts (e.g., ''Entropy is optional for DRBGs''). Ensure distractors promote analysis (e.g., symmetric/asymmetric
    mix-ups) and are derived from voter-noted pitfalls like weak entropy assumptions.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Key Generation Security''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) > Specialized Supply
  Chain Areas > Cryptographic Supply Chain > Key Generation Security). Generate 40 high-quality flashcards using the exact
  schema: Front (question), Back (answer + explanation + references + active_learning_link if applicable).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM JSON]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM JSON] – Distribute flashcards evenly (10 per layer).

  - Active Learning: Tie 20% of cards to discussion/peer/problem-solving prompts [INSERT FULL ACTIVE LEARNING FROM JSON].

  - Prioritize NIST standards: SP 800-133 (key gen), SP 800-57 (lifecycle), SP 800-90A/B/C (RBGs), FIPS 140 (modules).

  - Address misconceptions: Weak entropy, hardware vs software RBGs, direct vs derivation.

  - Bloom''s coverage: Balanced across levels.


  Flashcard Schema: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD_SCHEMA FROM JSON]. Use distractor protocol strictly for MCQs. Ensure university-level
  rigor: precise, actionable, with security strength calcs (e.g., 2^128 effort).


  Output ONLY a numbered list of flashcards in JSON array format: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
