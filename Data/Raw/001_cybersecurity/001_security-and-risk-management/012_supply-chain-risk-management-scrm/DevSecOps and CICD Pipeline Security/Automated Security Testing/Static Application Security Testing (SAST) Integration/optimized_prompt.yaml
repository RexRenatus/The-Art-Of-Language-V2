active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of early SAST integration in CI/CD pipelines versus developer
    productivity. Consider false positives, supply chain risks, and real-world examples from OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
    What metrics would you use to measure success?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    mcq_options: '4 options always. Distractors: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''SAST is black-box'' vs white-box), 2) Related
      but wrong term (e.g., DAST instead of SAST), 3) Extreme/overstated (e.g., ''SAST finds 100% vulns''), 1 correct. Ensure
      plausible based on research (e.g., false positives as distractor).'
    quality_check: Distractors must be verifiable from context; avoid 'all/none' traps.
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy\
  \ using Bloom's Taxonomy, active learning, and scaffolding. Topic: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Integration\
  \ (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) > DevSecOps and CI/CD Pipeline\
  \ Security > Automated Security Testing > SAST Integration).\n\nIncorporate this content:\n- Research: SAST is white-box\
  \ code analysis for vulns (e.g., injections, crypto flaws) without execution. Key in SSDLC/DevSecOps/SCRM. Tools: SonarQube,\
  \ Semgrep. Issues: False pos/neg. Standards: NIST 800-218, OWASP ASVS/Top 10.\n- Prior knowledge: SDLC, DevOps, OWASP Top\
  \ 10.\n- Scaffolding: Layer 1 Foundation (terms), Layer 2 Components (tools/phases), Layer 3 Implementation (CI/CD steps/code),\
  \ Layer 4 Integration (DAST, SCRM links).\n- Objectives: [Insert the 6 learning_objectives array here].\n- Active learning\
