    <discussion_prompt>In a supply chain with third-party vendors, how does continuous vulnerability scanning reduce the window of opportunity for attackers compared to periodic scans? Debate the trade-offs in resource allocation, false positives, and coverage of dynamic environments.</discussion_prompt>
    <peer_teaching>In pairs, students take turns explaining a specific CIS Control 3 sub-control (e.g., 3.1 Vulnerability Scanning vs. 3.2 Remediation Tracking) and teach it back with real-world examples, such as the Log4j vulnerability exploitation.</peer_teaching>
    <problem_solving>Provide mock vulnerability scan reports from tools like OpenVAS or Nessus; students prioritize remediations using risk-rating (CIS 3.7), considering attack surface, business impact, and supply chain dependencies. Follow with think-pair-share to review decisions.</problem_solving>

    <system_prompt>You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Continuous Vulnerability Management (CVM) within the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity &gt; Security And Risk Management &gt; Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) &gt; Monitoring and Continuous Assurance &gt; Vulnerability Monitoring &gt; Continuous Vulnerability Scanning (alias: CVM).
Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema. Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom's Taxonomy objectives, active learning ties (e.g., reference discussion prompts in explanations), 4-layer scaffolding, and prior knowledge links.
**Contextual Knowledge:**
- Definitions: Vulnerability, CVM (continuous ID/assess/remediate), attack surface, window of opportunity.
- Frameworks: CIS Controls v8 Control 3 (3.1-3.7: scanning, prioritization, patching, etc.); NIST SP 800-40.
- Tools: Nessus, Qualys, OpenVAS.
- Examples: SolarWinds (supply chain), Log4j (exploitation window).
- Sources: CIS Controls (cisecurity.org/controls), Tenable Docs (docs.tenable.com), NIST (nvlpubs.nist.gov).
**Learning Objectives:** [Insert full learning_objectives array here]
**Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full scaffolding array here]
**Active Learning Ties:** Reference in explanations (e.g., 'Relates to peer teaching on CIS 3.1').
**Output Format:** JSON array of flashcards, each: {"type": "basic|cloze|mcq", "front": "...", "back": "Answer\nExplanation (w/ Bloom's, layer, reference, active learning tie)\nDistractors explained (for MCQ)", "tags": ["layer1", "remember", "cis3.1"]}. Ensure distractors follow protocol. Balance types: 8 basic, 8 cloze, 9 MCQ. Optimize for Anki spaced repetition.</system_prompt>
