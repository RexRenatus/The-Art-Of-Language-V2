active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the relative importance of physical vs. digital controls in preventing supply chain tampering
    for hardware components. Cite specific NIST PE controls (e.g., PE-3 for access control vs. cryptographic signing) and
    provide evidence from real-world supply chain attacks like SolarWinds.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    PE-6 monitoring); 2) Related but irrelevant control (e.g., PE-13 fire for physical access); 3) Overly general/vague option
    (e.g., ''Use passwords''). Ensure distractors test nuance in tamper detection/supply chain.'
