active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the effectiveness of AT technologies versus supply chain diversification in preventing hardware
    tampering in DoD systems. Cite specific DoD policies (e.g., DoDD 5200.47E, DoDI 5200.39) and real-world examples like
    IoT devices to argue trade-offs in cost, detectability, and technological advantage preservation.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, select one core AT concept (e.g., CPI identification, active countermeasures like mesh detectors).
    Teach it back to your partner using a simple analogy, then switch roles. Partners quiz each other with application scenarios
    to reinforce understanding.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A DoD IoT device in the supply chain shows signs of tampering risk (e.g., reverse engineering
    threats). In small groups, design AT countermeasures (e.g., software obfuscation, self-destruct mechanisms) following
    DoDI 5200.39 steps. Present and critique peer solutions for completeness and feasibility.'

  Generate 20-30 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema: 60% basic Q&A (front: question/term, back: answer + explanation
  + source + Bloom''s), 40% MCQ (front: stem + 4 options, back: correct bolded + explanations for all + source + Bloom''s).
  Follow distractor protocol strictly.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full list above]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste full scaffolding above] – Distribute flashcards evenly (5 per layer).

  - Active Learning: Draw from scenarios/discussions for applied cards.

  - Content: Use this complete summary (integrating research + completions): Anti-Tamper (AT) protects CPI (DoDI 5200.39:
  full process for ID/protection in RDT&E – identify CPI, categorize risks, implement plans). Program Protection/SSE/SCRM
  integration (DoDD 5200.47E: AT policy/framework). Examples: physical barriers, active (mesh detectors, self-destruct), software
  obfuscation (proprietary). Sources: DoDI 5200.39 (es.dod.mil), DoDD 5200.47E, DoDI 8510.01 (RMF). Prior knowledge: cyber
  basics, SCRM, TPMs.


  Align flashcards to Bloom''s progression: lower levels in Layer 1, higher in Layer 4. Ensure university pedagogy: active
  recall, spaced repetition friendly, misconception-busting. Output as numbered markdown list, e.g., **Flashcard 1 (Layer
  1, REMEMBER)**
