    practices, (2) NIST SP 1800-34 Volume A (Building Blocks and Threat Model), (3) Volume B (Reference Design for Remote
    Attestation), or (4) Volume C (Implementation and Validation). Peers then quiz each other using flashcards generated from
    this topic.'
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: Your organization is procuring embedded systems from a multi-tier global supplier. Identify
    potential tampering risks (e.g., counterfeiting at Tier 2), apply NIST SP 800-161 risk assessment steps, and develop a
    verification plan including provenance checks and remote attestation. Present solutions and peer-review for completeness.'

    2. Partial truth/related concept (e.g., software-only method for hardware issue).

    3. Extreme/oversimplified error (e.g., ''no verification needed for trusted suppliers''). Ensure distractors are realistic,

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 30-50 high-quality flashcards on ''Hardware Integrity Verification''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) > Hardware Supply Chain
  Security > Tamper Detection and Resistance > Hardware Integrity Verification).


  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives**: [paste the full array from ''learning_objectives'']

  - **Scaffolding**: Use 4 layers + prior knowledge exactly as defined [paste full scaffolding JSON].

  - **Active Learning Support**: Include cards that prompt discussion (e.g., critique prompts), peer teaching (e.g., explain
  NIST volumes), and problem-solving (scenario Qs).

  - **Research Context**: Core concepts: Integrity (genuine/unmodified), Provenance (lifecycle history), Tampering (unauth
  mods), Counterfeiting (fakes). Standards: NIST SP 800-161 R1 (C-SCRM: risk mgmt, supplier assurance); NIST SP 1800-34 (Vol
  A: building blocks/threats; Vol B: remote attestation ref design; Vol C: impl/validation for integrity). Big picture: Prevents
  hardware trojans, integrates NIST RMF/Zero Trust, national security. Sources: NIST SP 800-161r1 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-161r1),
  SP 1800-34 (https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/projects/hardware-root-trust).


  Strictly follow the **Flashcard Schema** [paste full schema]. Ensure cards are optimized for Anki/Quizlet: challenging yet
  scaffolded, with explanations promoting higher-order thinking. Vary phrasing for spaced repetition. Voter consensus (70%
  approval): Emphasize NIST completions, Bloom''s progression, big picture.


  Output ONLY the JSON array of flashcards, valid and parseable. No extra text.'
