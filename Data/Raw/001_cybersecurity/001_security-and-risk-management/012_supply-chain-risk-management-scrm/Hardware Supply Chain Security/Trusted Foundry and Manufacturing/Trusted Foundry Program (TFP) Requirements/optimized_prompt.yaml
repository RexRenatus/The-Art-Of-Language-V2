active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a world of globalized supply chains, debate whether the Trusted Foundry Program's strict requirements
    are essential for national security or overly restrictive to innovation. Use real-world examples like the SolarWinds hack
    or chip shortages to support your position, and connect to broader SCRM principles such as vendor risk assessment.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    are inherently trusted'' or ''chain of custody only applies to classified ICs''). Base on research context errors, voter
    priorities (e.g., confuse TFP with general SCRM), or real-world pitfalls (e.g., SolarWinds-like untrusted sources). Ensure
    one distractor is a ''too broad'' overgeneralization, one ''too narrow'' underestimation, one ''reverse'' opposite.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Supply Chain Risk Management

  Research Context: TFP is a DoD/DMEA program assuring IC integrity/confidentiality lifecycle. Key: Trusted Source (assesses
  people/processes/tech for microelectronics/ASICs), Chain of Custody (tracks ICs origin-to-use), Assurances. Addresses global
  risks. Full Sources: DMEA TFP Guidebook, DoDI 5000.02, NIST SP 800-161r1 (SCRM), CMMC 2.0, DISA STIGs. Certification: Facility
  audits, tamper protection, ongoing verification.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste array above]. Generate 8-10 cards per objective.

  - Scaffolding: [paste layers above]. Cards must reference layers (e.g., ''Layer 3: Implementation step 2'').

  - Active Learning: [paste activities above]. Include hints tying to discussion/problem-solving.

  - Prior Knowledge: Link to SCRM basics (vendor assessment, vulns).

  - Big Picture: TFP in DoD national security/SCRM.


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards matching schema: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [...]}}]. Ensure completeness, pedagogy progression, web-grounded accuracy.
  Vary difficulty; use diagrams in text for Layer 2.'
