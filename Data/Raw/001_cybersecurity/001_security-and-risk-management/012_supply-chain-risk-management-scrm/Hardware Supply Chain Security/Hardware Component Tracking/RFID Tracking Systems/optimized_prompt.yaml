  Incorporate this comprehensive pedagogical framework:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE]


  Content must be complete: Include RFID definitions, components (RF/Enterprise/Inter-Enterprise subsystems), tag types (passive/active/semi),
  risks (eavesdropping, cloning, DoS), best practices (encryption, access controls from NIST SP 800-98), textual concept map
  elements.


  Generate flashcards following this exact schema: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD_GENERATION_SCHEMA FROM ABOVE].


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"type": "basic|mcq|cloze", "front": "...", "back": "...", "blooms_level":
  "REMEMBER|etc", "scaffolding_layer": 1-4, "explanation": "detailed as per schema"}.

  Ensure 100% coverage of objectives, layers, risks, NIST refs, voter consensus (completeness, pedagogy, engagement, scaffolding).
