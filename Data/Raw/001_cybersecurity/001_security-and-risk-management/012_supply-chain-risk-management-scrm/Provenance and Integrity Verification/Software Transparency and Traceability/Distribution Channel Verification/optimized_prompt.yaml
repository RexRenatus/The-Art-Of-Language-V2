active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of high-profile supply chain attacks like SolarWinds (2020) and XZ Utils (2024), discuss
    how failures in distribution channel verification enabled compromise. What role does provenance tracking play, and how
    can organizations balance cost with security in choosing channels? Debate the trade-offs between authorized distributors
    and gray markets.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Base on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Gray market is authorized if discounted' – wrong, lacks provenance).
    - Partial truths (e.g., 'Tampering only physical' – ignores software).
    - Real-world confusions (e.g., SolarWinds as 'distribution' vs. 'build' compromise).
    - 3-4 options always; 1 correct; plausible but incorrect.
    - 'Ensure coverage: 40% remember/understand, 30% apply/analyze, 30% evaluate/create.'

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full list above].

  - Active Learning: Tie cards to discussion (SolarWinds), peer teaching (NIST App B), problem-solving (scenarios).

  - Scaffolding: [paste full 4 layers, including completed NIST details, sources, examples, concept map].

  - Voter Priorities: Completeness (full NIST SP 800-161r1 App B: supplier practices, distribution controls), pedagogy (Bloom''s
  progression), big picture (SolarWinds/XZ/Supermicro), prior knowledge links.

  - Research Context: [paste core concepts/definitions].


  Generate flashcards per schema: [paste full schema + distractor protocol]. Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''...'', ''question'':
  ''...'', ''options'': [...], ''correct'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''blooms_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''...'',
  ''source_ref'': ''...''}]. Ensure university-level pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition, misconception correction.
  Cover all objectives/layers evenly; use authoritative sources only.'
