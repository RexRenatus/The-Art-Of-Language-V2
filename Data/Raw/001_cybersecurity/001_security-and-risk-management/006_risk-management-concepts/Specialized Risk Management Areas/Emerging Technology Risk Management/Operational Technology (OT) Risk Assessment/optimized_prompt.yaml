active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges of OT-IT convergence in risk assessment (e.g., legacy OT
    systems meeting IT security standards). Propose hybrid solutions drawing from NIST SP 800-82r3 and IEC 62443, and vote
    on the most feasible approach for a water treatment plant scenario.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ types (aim for 25% of cards): Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions
    (e.g., ''IT prioritizes availability over safety'' as distractor for OT priorities; confuse NIST RMF steps with generic
    IT; mix IEC 62443 SL with NIST CSF tiers). Ensure 1 highly plausible (near-miss), 1 obvious wrong, 1 conceptual error.
    Mark correct answer.'

  Incorporate this comprehensive research context: OT = hardware/software for physical process control (ICS/SCADA). Risks
  emphasize safety/reliability. NIST SP 800-82r3: Full guide on OT security, adapts NIST RMF (7 steps: Prepare, Categorize,
  Select, Implement, Assess, Authorize, Monitor) with OT specifics (zones/conduits segmentation, non-disruptive testing, ICS
  threats like DoS on PLCs). IEC 62443: IACS security standards (SL 1-4 for capability/target, foundational requirements,
  system segregation). ISA-99: Basis for IEC 62443. NIST CSF: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover - OT mappings. Sources:
  NIST SP 800-82r3 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-82r3); IEC 62443 (https://www.iec.ch/tc65); ISA-99 (https://www.isa.org/standards/iec-62443);
  CISA ICS advisories (https://www.cisa.gov/ics).
