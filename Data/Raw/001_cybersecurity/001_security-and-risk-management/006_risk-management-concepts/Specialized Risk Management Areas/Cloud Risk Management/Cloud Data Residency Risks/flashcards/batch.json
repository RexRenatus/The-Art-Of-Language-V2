        "core_logic": "Cross-border data transfers are heavily regulated by laws like GDPR, requiring specific legal bases and mechanisms; therefore, organizations must ensure their cloud provider uses these approved methods (like SCCs or BCRs) because simply encrypting data is insufficient for legal compliance.",
