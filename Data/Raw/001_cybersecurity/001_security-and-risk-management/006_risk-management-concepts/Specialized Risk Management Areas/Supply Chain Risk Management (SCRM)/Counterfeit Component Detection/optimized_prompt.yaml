active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether visual inspection or digital provenance tracking is more effective for
    counterfeit detection in high-stakes supply chains like defense systems, citing NIST SP 800-161r1 controls (e.g., SR-10,
    SR-11) and trade-offs such as cost, scalability, and false positives. Support with evidence from real-world cases.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    ''tampered'' vs ''counterfeit''); 2) Partial truth (e.g., ''low price indicator only''); 3) Unrelated NIST control (e.g.,
    CM-6 vs CM-14). Ensure plausible to educated guessers but incorrect per NIST SP 800-161r1/SP 800-53r5.'

  Core Content: Counterfeit components (misrepresented products); Provenance (lifecycle history); C-SCRM (cyber SCRM); NIST
  SP 800-161r1 (C-SCRM practices); SP 800-53r5 controls (SR-10: inspection, SR-11: authenticity, CM-14: counterfeit prevention
  via trusted certificates/sources). Sources: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-161r1.pdf,

  Learning Objectives: [Insert the 6 objectives above]. Ensure flashcards target these.


  Scaffolding: [Insert the 4 layers above]. Distribute flashcards across layers.


  Active Learning Integration: Draw from discussion (visual vs digital), peer teaching (SR-11/CM-14), problem-solving (avionics
  scenario) for scenario-based cards.


  Use Flashcard Schema: [Insert full schema above]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as an object with fields:
  {''question'': str, ''answer'': str, ''distractors'': [str,str,str], ''explanation'': str, ''bloom_level'': str, ''scaffolding_layer'':
  int, ''topic_hierarchy'': str}. Prioritize active recall, misconceptions, and NIST accuracy. Generate 40-50 unique, high-quality
  cards spanning all elements.'
