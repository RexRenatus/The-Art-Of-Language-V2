  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''CCPA compliance risks are overstated for small businesses
    since thresholds apply.'' Use examples of consumer rights violations and penalties to support your position, referencing
    risk areas like SPI handling and opt-out mechanisms.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Scope creep (over/under-state thresholds); 3) Outdated info (pre-CPRA rules). Ensure plausible for mid-level learners.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education (Domain: Security And Risk Management
  > Risk Management Concepts > Compliance and Legal Risk > Regulatory Compliance Risk > CCPA Compliance Risk). Use the provided
  Topic Hierarchy, Learning Objectives, Active Learning components, Scaffolding layers (completing all voter-suggested content),
  and Flashcard Schema to generate 25 high-quality flashcards.

  Incorporate:

  - Bloom''s progression: Balance across levels per objectives.

  - Scaffolding: Tag cards to layers (e.g., Layer 1: Foundation).

  - Active Learning: Include prompts linking to activities (e.g., ''Discuss: Evaluate this risk'').

  - Voter Priorities: Full risk areas (notices, rights violations, SPI, assessments, vendors, audits); prior knowledge (GDPR/NIST);
  concept map elements.


  Generate exactly 25 flashcards in JSON array format: [{''id'':1, ''bloom_level'':''REMEMBER'', ''scaffolding_layer'':1,
