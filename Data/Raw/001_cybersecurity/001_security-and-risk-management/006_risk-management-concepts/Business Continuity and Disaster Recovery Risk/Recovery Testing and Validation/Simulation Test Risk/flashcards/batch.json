      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The absence of a clear debriefing process after a simulation test poses a significant risk because it functions by missing crucial opportunities for learning and improvement, thereby diminishing the overall value of the test, since the structured reflection and analysis needed to identify lessons learned are absent. This connects the lack of a formal review to a failure in organizational learning and continuous improvement.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors focus on technical complexity, overestimating efficiency, or solely IT recovery, failing to address the core risk: the simulation's value is significantly reduced if there's no structured process to capture insights, identify areas for improvement, and translate those findings into actionable changes.",
        "analogy": "Completing a challenging project without a post-mortem meeting to discuss what went well and what could be improved is like running a simulation test without a debriefing; you miss the chance to learn from the experience and make future projects more successful."
