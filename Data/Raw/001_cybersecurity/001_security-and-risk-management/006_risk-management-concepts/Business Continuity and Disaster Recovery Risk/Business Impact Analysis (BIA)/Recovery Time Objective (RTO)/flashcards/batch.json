        "core_logic": "Understanding system dependencies is crucial because a failure in one component can halt or delay the recovery of others, thus influencing the overall RTO for interconnected services. This works by mapping out how systems rely on each other, ensuring that recovery plans address the entire chain of operations, not just individual components.",

        "analogy": "If a car's engine (System A) needs to be repaired before its transmission (System B) can be tested, the RTO for System B is dependent on the RTO for System A; you can't fix the transmission until the engine is running."
