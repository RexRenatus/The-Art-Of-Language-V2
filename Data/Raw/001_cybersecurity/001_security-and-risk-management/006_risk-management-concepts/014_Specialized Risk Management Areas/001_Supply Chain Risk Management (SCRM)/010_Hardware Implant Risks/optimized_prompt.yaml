active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In small groups, debate the feasibility of completely eliminating hardware implant risks in global supply
    chains. Consider real-world examples like the Bloomberg Supermicro case or Intel Management Engine vulnerabilities, and
    propose trade-offs between cost, security, and supply chain efficiency.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Plausible but partial truths (e.g., 'Firmware backdoor' as distractor for 'Hardware trojan')
    - Common misconceptions (e.g., confuse IoMT with general IoT; overlook systemic risks)
    - Similar concepts (e.g., software malware vs. hardware implant)
    - Outdated/irrelevant examples (e.g., legacy devices without supply chain focus)
    - Exaggerations/understatements (e.g., 'No risk if encrypted' ignoring physical tampering)
    count: Always 3 distractors per MCQ
    balance: Ensure coverage across layers/objectives
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy progression, active learning integration, scaffolding). Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic
  ''Hardware Implant Risks'' in the hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Risk Management Concepts > Specialized
  Risk Management Areas > Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) > Hardware Implant Risks.


  Incorporate these elements:

  - LEARNING OBJECTIVES: [insert full list from JSON]

  - SCAFFOLDING LAYERS: [insert full scaffolding from JSON] – Generate cards explicitly tagged by layer and Bloom''s level.

  - ACTIVE LEARNING: Draw inspiration for explanations linking to activities [insert summaries].

  - FLASHCARD SCHEMA: Strictly follow [insert full schema]. Focus on supply chain hardware implants (tampered chips, trojans,
  backdoors; e.g., Supermicro, Intel ME), expand beyond IoMT to general SCRM, include systemic risks, mitigations (TPLC, SBOM,
  NIST).


  Content must be complete/accurate: Risks (manufacturing tampering, data exfiltration, systemic propagation, safety compromise);
  Mitigations (vendor vetting, inspection, root of trust).


  Output 25-30 flashcards in JSON array format: [{''id'':1, ''layer'':''1'', ''bloom'':''Remember'', ''front'':''...'', ''options'':[''A...'',''B...''],
  ''back'':{''answer'':''...'', ''explanation'':''...'', ''distractors_rationale'':''...'', ''source'':''...'', ''related_activity'':''...''}},
  ...]. Ensure distractors follow protocol, explanations are educational and 100-200 words.'
