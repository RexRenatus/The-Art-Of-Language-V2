active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the effectiveness of the Shared Responsibility Model in mitigating risks when using CSPs like
    AWS or Azure. Which party (CSP or customer) typically bears greater responsibility for misconfigurations, and why? Use
    NIST SP 800-30 to support arguments and address common misconceptions like 'CSPs handle all security'.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Context & Sources:**

  - Definitions: CSP (cloud services provider), Risk Assessment (identify/analyze/evaluate risks), Shared Responsibility Model
  (CSP/customer split), Threat/Vulnerability/Likelihood/Impact/Risk (likelihood x impact) per NIST.

  - Key Frameworks: NIST SP 800-30 (risk assessment guide: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/30/r1/final), NIST SP 800-53
  (security/privacy controls catalog: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final), FedRAMP (https://www.fedramp.gov/),
  CSA CCM (https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/cloud-controls-matrix-v4/).

  - Prerequisites: Basic risk terms, cloud models (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS).

  - Misconceptions: CSP handles all security; confuse threat/vuln; ignore customer configs.


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s):** [Insert full list from above].

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full scaffolding from above].

  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Ensure cards prompt recall for discussions (e.g., Shared Model debate), peer teaching (definitions),
  problem-solving (scenarios).


  **Output Format (JSON Array of Cards):** Each card: {"type": "MCQ/Definition/etc.", "bloom_level": "Remember/etc.", "layer":
  "1-4", "front": "...", "back": "Answer | Explanation (why correct, distractors wrong if MCQ) | Source | Remediation (link
  to activity/objective)"}. Use schema exactly: MCQs have 4 options (A-D, mark correct), distractors per protocol (plausible
  misconceptions). Balance: 10 MCQs, 8 definitions, 5 application, 2 analysis/create. Make engaging, university-level, with
  formative assessments (e.g., self-check MCQs).'
