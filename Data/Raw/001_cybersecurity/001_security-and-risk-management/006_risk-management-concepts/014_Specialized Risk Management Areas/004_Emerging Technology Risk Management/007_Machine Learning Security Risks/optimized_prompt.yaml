active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of healthcare AI diagnostics, which ML security risk—data poisoning or evasion attacks—poses
    the greater threat, and why? Debate using NIST frameworks (e.g., AI 100-2) and real-world examples like manipulated medical
    images or poisoned training datasets from public incidents.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for university-level cybersecurity education on 'Machine Learning Security\
  \ Risks' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Risk Management Concepts > Specialized Risk Management\
  \ Areas > Emerging Technology Risk Management > Machine Learning Security Risks). Use this optimized learning prompt to\
  \ generate high-quality, spaced-repetition friendly flashcards.\n\n**Learning Objectives (Bloom's progression):** [Insert\
  \ the full learning_objectives array here].\n\n**Active Learning Integration:** Weave in elements from discussion_prompt,\
  \ peer_teaching_activity, and problem_solving_exercise into explanations (e.g., 'Apply via Tesla case study').\n\n**Scaffolding:**\
  \ Generate flashcards in 4 layers: [Insert full scaffolding_layers here]. Distribute evenly.\n\n**Prior Knowledge:** Assume\
  \ basics in ML (training/inference) and CIA triad.\n\n**Content Sources:** NIST AI 100-1 (Trustworthy AI), AI 100-2e2025\
  \ (AML), OWASP ML Top 10. Privacy risks: model inversion (reconstruct data), membership inference (detect training participation),\
