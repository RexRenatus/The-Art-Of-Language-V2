  **Completed Research Context:** VAST overcomes traditional threat modeling limits with practicality for Agile/DevOps. Core:
  Visual (DFDs/process flows), Agile (iterative/just-in-time), Simple (templates/stakeholder-friendly). Models: Application
  (dev-focused, app flows); Operational (infra-focused, attacker view). Key Pillars: 1. **Visual Modeling:** Diagrams reveal
  attack surfaces. 2. **Agile Integration:** Continuous, SDLC-embedded. 3. **Simple Templates:** Pre-built threats (STRIDE-based).
  4. **Automation:** Tools for analysis/validation/observation. Prerequisites: STRIDE, DFDs, basic threat modeling. Sources:
  ThreatModeler.com/vast, ''Threat Modeling: Designing for Security'' by Adam Shostack (contextual), OWASP Threat Modeling
  Cheat Sheet.


  **Instructions:** Generate 50 high-quality flashcards progressing through scaffolding layers (Layer 1: Foundation; Layer
  2: Components; Layer 3: Implementation; Layer 4: Integration). Align to these Learning Objectives: [insert full list from
  JSON]. Incorporate Active Learning: Draw from discussion/peer/problem-solving for scenario-based cards.


  Use Flashcard Schema: [insert full schema]. Vary formats (40% MCQ w/distractors, 30% cloze, 20% short answer, 10% diagram-describe).
  Ensure atomic, measurable content for Bloom''s progression. Tag each with bloom_level and layer.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards.'
