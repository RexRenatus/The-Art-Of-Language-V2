active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In groups, debate the most critical TTPs for initial access in enterprise environments using MITRE ATT&CK
    examples (e.g., Phishing vs. Valid Accounts). How do these evolve with cloud adoption, and what gaps exist in current
    threat intelligence integration?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 1 plausible alternative from similar TTP (e.g., confuse Tactics with Techniques).
    - 1 common misconception (e.g., TTPs as static vs. dynamic).
    - 1 unrelated but superficially similar concept (e.g., IOC vs. TTP).
    - 1 reverse/extreme (e.g., 'No difference between tactics and procedures').
    - Ensure distractors are realistic, web-grounded (from ATT&CK/breaches), and promote analysis.
