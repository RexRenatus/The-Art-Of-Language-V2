    <discussion_prompt>Debate whether a small business should accept the risk of not implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all systems due to employee resistance and high implementation costs. Consider the organization's risk tolerance, potential impacts (e.g., data breach), and alternatives like partial MFA rollout. Divide into pro-acceptance and pro-mitigation teams, then vote and reflect on consensus.</discussion_prompt>
