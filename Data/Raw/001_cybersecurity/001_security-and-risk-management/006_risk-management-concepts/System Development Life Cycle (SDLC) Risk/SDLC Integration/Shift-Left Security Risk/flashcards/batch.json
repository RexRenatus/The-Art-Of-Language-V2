        "core_logic": "Continuous monitoring supports 'shift-left' by providing feedback loops that inform earlier stages of development about emerging threats and vulnerabilities discovered in production. This works by analyzing real-time operational data to identify patterns or weaknesses that should be addressed in future development cycles, thus refining the 'leftward' shift.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors misrepresent continuous monitoring as purely reactive, conflate it with automated patching, or suggest it replaces essential development-stage security testing, all of which are incorrect interpretations.",
        "analogy": "Continuous monitoring is like a chef tasting ingredients and the cooking process throughout, providing feedback to adjust the recipe before the final dish is served."

        "core_logic": "The primary benefit of integrating security into the requirements and design phases is to build security in from the ground up, making it an inherent part of the system. This approach works by embedding security considerations into the fundamental architecture and logic, preventing vulnerabilities from being introduced and reducing the need for costly retrofits.",
