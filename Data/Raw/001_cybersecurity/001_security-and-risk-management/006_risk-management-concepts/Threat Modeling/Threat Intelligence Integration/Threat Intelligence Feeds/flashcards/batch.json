        "core_logic": "STIX best practices recommend consolidating criteria that apply to the same SCO type within a single observation expression, using AND or OR operators. This approach enhances pattern readability and efficiency because it logically groups related conditions, making it easier for both humans and machines to parse and execute the pattern against observed data.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors suggest inefficiently separating criteria, misusing the 'FOLLOWEDBY' operator for conjunction, or incorrectly proposing separate STIX objects for pattern criteria, all of which deviate from best practices for pattern construction.",
        "analogy": "When writing a STIX pattern, grouping criteria for the same SCO is like writing a single, detailed sentence describing a suspect (e.g., 'The suspect had red hair AND was wearing a blue jacket') rather than multiple short, disconnected sentences."

        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors propose fabricating data (placeholder CVE), withholding valuable intelligence (omitting until CVE exists), or using a less appropriate object ('Note' instead of 'description'), all of which fail to properly represent un-CVE'd vulnerabilities.",
