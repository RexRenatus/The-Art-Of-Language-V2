  ## Completed Research Context: Risk Acceptance Criteria

  Risk acceptance criteria define thresholds for accepting cybersecurity risks without mitigation, aligned with business objectives.


  **Core Concepts:** Risk Acceptance: Accept if cost > benefit or within tolerance. Criteria: Specific conditions (e.g., risk
  score < 5/10). Links to Risk Tolerance (degree assumed) and Appetite (strategic willingness).


  **Frameworks:**

  - NIST CSF 2.0: GOVERN (GV.RM-03) defines risk appetite/tolerance for acceptance decisions.

  - NIST SP 800-39: Risk response strategies (accept if framed within organizational tolerance; Sections 2.4-3.3 detail framing/assessment/response/monitoring).

  - NIST SP 800-30: Risk assessment feeding into acceptance.

  - ISO/IEC 27005: Risk treatment (accept as option).


  **Misconceptions:** Acceptance ≠ avoidance; must align with business.

  **Concept Map:** Cybersecurity → Security & Risk Mgmt → Risk Concepts → Fundamentals → Tolerance/Appetite → Acceptance Criteria.

  **Sources:** NIST CSF 2.0 (csf.tools), SP 800-39 (nvlpubs.nist.gov), SP 800-30, ISO 27005.
