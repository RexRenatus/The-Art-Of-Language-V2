This allows for earlier identification of potential incidents, meaning the response process can begin sooner, directly contributing to a lower MTTR because the clock starts ticking earlier.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The correct answer explains how earlier detection via monitoring shortens the overall incident timeline. Distractors suggest monitoring increases workload (if poorly implemented), is only preventative, or generates excessive false positives (a sign of poor tuning, not inherent to monitoring).",
