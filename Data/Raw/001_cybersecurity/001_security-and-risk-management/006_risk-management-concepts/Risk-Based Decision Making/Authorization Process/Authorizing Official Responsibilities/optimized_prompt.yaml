active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a scenario where a critical national security system has unresolved high-risk vulnerabilities (e.g.,
    similar to SolarWinds), but patching would cause unacceptable downtime, debate whether the AO should authorize operations.
    Discuss trade-offs between risk acceptance, mission continuity, and accountability per NIST SP 800-37.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains a specific AO responsibility (e.g., risk determination vs. risk acceptance,
    or oversight of POA&Ms), while the listener probes for and identifies one common misconception (e.g., 'The AO can fully
    delegate risk decisions to the system owner'). Switch roles and debrief as a group.
  problem_solving: Provide a mock authorization package (excerpts from security plan, assessment report, POA&M with unresolved
    high-risk items). Students analyze gaps, apply RMF 'Authorize' step criteria, and draft an AO decision memo recommending
    authorize, deny, or interim approval with conditions.

  distractor_protocol: Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse AO with security
    officer; mix up risk determination vs. acceptance; include near-misses like 'authorize without conditions' for high-risk).
    Distractors must be realistic, drawn from voter-noted errors or NIST non-examples, and explicitly wrong per research context.

  Incorporate these exactly:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: [paste the active_learning object here]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste the scaffolding array here]


  Content must be complete and accurate: AO is senior official accepting risks; responsibilities include risk determination/acceptance,
  reviewing authorization package (plans, reports, POA&Ms), issuing decisions (authorize, deny, interim/approve with conditions),
  oversight of continuous monitoring/POA&Ms, designating AODRs, periodic reauthorization. Reference NIST SP 800-37r2; link
  to RMF steps (Categorize-Select-Implement-Assess-Authorize-Monitor).


  Use this exact Flashcard Schema: [paste the flashcard_schema object here]. Output ONLY the JSON array of flashcards, no
  additional text. Ensure coverage: all objectives, layers, voter priorities (e.g., decision types, monitoring), and misconceptions.
  Cards promote Bloom''s progression and active learning ties.'
