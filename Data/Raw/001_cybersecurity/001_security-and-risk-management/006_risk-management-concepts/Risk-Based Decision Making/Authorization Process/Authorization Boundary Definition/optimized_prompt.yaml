active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Using NIST SP 800-37 Rev 2, debate the inclusion of a third-party cloud service (e.g., SaaS email integrated
    with an internal system) within an organization's authorization boundary. Consider mission alignment, management control,
    and risk factors. What trade-offs exist between broad vs. narrow boundaries? Address common misconceptions, such as assuming
    boundaries are only physical or include everything connected.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions: 1) Overly broad inclusion (e.g.,
    ''everything connected, including separately authorized systems''); 2) Narrow/physical-only focus (e.g., ''only hardware
    and network perimeters''); 3) Confusion with related terms (e.g., ''same as system categorization'' or ''includes third-party
    without management control''). Ensure distractors are realistic from research context and voter suggestions.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST-aligned Risk Management
  Framework (RMF) concepts. Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Authorization Boundary Definition'' (Topic Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Risk Management Concepts > Risk-Based Decision Making > Authorization Process
  > Authorization Boundary Definition).


  Incorporate this research summary: An authorization boundary defines the scope of protection for an information system,
  including all components (hardware, software, firmware, infrastructure, personnel, procedures) under direct management control,
  excluding separately authorized systems (NIST SP 800-37 Rev 2). Key in RMF Prepare phase (Task P-11). Sources: NIST SP 800-37
  Rev 2 (primary); related RMF docs.


  Align flashcards to these LEARNING OBJECTIVES [insert array above]. Use SCAFFOLDING LAYERS [insert scaffolding object above]
  for progressive coverage. Draw from ACTIVE LEARNING activities [insert active_learning object above] for scenarios/discussions.


  Follow the FLASHCARD SCHEMA exactly [insert schema above]. Output a JSON array of 25-30 flashcards, each as an object matching
  one structure type. Ensure variety, full coverage (objectives, layers, Bloom''s), and distractors per protocol. Prioritize
  active recall, misconception correction, and integration with RMF/ATO process.'
