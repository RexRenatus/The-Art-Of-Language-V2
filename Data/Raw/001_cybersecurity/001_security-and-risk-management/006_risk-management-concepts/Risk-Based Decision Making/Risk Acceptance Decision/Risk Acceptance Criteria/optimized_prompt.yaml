active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In small groups, debate the trade-offs of accepting residual cybersecurity risks in resource-constrained
    startups versus large enterprises (e.g., accepting unpatched legacy systems). How do business objectives influence acceptance
    criteria? Share real-world examples like post-incident risk decisions in breaches such as SolarWinds.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - '3 distractors per MCQ: Plausible based on common errors (e.g., confuse residual with inherent risk; tolerance with
      appetite; threshold as always quantitative).'
    - 'Source from: Misconceptions (e.g., ''Risk acceptance means no mitigation ever''), partial truths (e.g., NIST CSF explicit
      term), or opposites (e.g., ''Reject all risks above zero'').'
    - Ensure 1 highly plausible (e.g., swaps tolerance/threshold), 1 superficially correct but incomplete, 1 clearly wrong.
    - Avoid 'all/none of the above'; mark correct as 'A/B/C/D'.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Risk Management Concepts.
  Topic: Risk Acceptance Criteria (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Risk Management Concepts > Risk-Based
  Decision Making > Risk Acceptance Decision > Risk Acceptance Criteria). Use this to create mastery-enabling cards.


  INTEGRATE:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the 6 objectives above].

  - Scaffolding: 4 layers [paste scaffolding details]. Prerequisite: Risk basics (NIST SP 800-30). Big picture: Enables balanced
  investments aligning security/business.

  - Active Learning: Inspire cards mimicking activities (scenarios, comparisons).

  - Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (Govern/Identify), ISO 31000:2018 (Clause 6.4 risk criteria), NIST SP 800-30 Rev1.


  Generate 24-30 flashcards per EXACT schema: JSON array of objects with front, back, type, explanation, bloom_level, scaffolding_layer,
  tags. Balance: Cover all objectives/layers/Bloom''s; 40% Q&A/Cloze (recall/apply), 60% MCQ. Use distractor protocol strictly.
  Ensure university-level: precise, scenario-based, explanations reference standards/examples. Promote active recall/spaced
  repetition. Output ONLY the JSON array.'
