active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages and disadvantages of prioritizing system-specific controls
    over common controls in an organization managing multiple interconnected systems. Use examples from NIST SP 800-53 (e.g.,
    custom app-level authentication vs. org-wide access policy) and address misconceptions like over-reliance on system-specific
    controls leading to duplication. Support arguments with risk management concepts.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST-aligned content. Generate
  high-quality, Anki-optimized flashcards for the topic ''System-Specific Controls'' using university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy
  progression, active learning integration, and scaffolding layers.


  **Topic Context (Incorporate Fully):** System-specific controls are tailored security/privacy safeguards managed by the
  system owner for a specific information system''s unique risks (NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5). Distinct from common (inheritable)
  and hybrid controls. Key roles: System Owner, Authorizing Official. 20 NIST families (e.g., AC, AU). Big Picture: NIST RMF
  Step 2. Prior Knowledge: Risk assessments (RA-3), control selection.


  **Learning Objectives (Cover Across Cards):** [Insert full list from learning_objectives above].


  **Scaffolding Layers (Balance Cards):** [Insert full scaffolding details above].


  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Draw from discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving for scenario-based cards.


  **Best Practices:** Tailoring via RA-3; integration/monitoring; avoid misconceptions.


  **Output 25 flashcards strictly in this JSON array format:**

  [{"id":1,"front":"Question?","back":{"answer":"Correct","explanation":"Rationale + NIST link + layer + Bloom"},"distractors":[{"option":"D1","why_wrong":"Explanation"},{...},{...}],"bloom_level":"REMEMBER","scaffolding_layer":"Layer1","topic_hierarchy":{"level1":"Cybersecurity","level2":"Security
