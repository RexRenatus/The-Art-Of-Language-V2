active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent should organizations be liable for third-party breaches under contracts citing NIST SP
    800-161? Argue using real-world cases like SolarWinds, considering the NIST CSF 2.0 GOVERN function's role in oversight.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - Learning objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding: Structure content across 4 layers [PASTE FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM ABOVE], with ~12-13 cards per layer, progressing
  from foundation to integration.

  - Active learning: Infuse prompts tying to discussion (e.g., SolarWinds liability), peer teaching (explain-back NIST terms),
  problem-solving (mock contracts).

  - Prior knowledge: Assume basics like CIA triad, general risk.

  - Content completeness: NIST CSF 2.0 GOVERN (GV.OC, GV.RM, GV.RR, GV.PO, GV.OV for supply chain/contract oversight); NIST
  SP 800-161r1 (C-SCRM practices); cases (SolarWinds, Equifax); sources as listed.
