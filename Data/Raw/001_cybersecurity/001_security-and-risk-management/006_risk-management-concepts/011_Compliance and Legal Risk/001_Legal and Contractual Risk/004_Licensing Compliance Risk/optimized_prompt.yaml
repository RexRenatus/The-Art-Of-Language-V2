active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Analyze a real-world case of licensing non-compliance, such as Autodesk audit cases or Microsoft's software
    audits. In groups, debate the root causes, impacts (legal, financial, reputational), and propose preventive measures.
    Compare proprietary vs. open-source licensing risks, addressing misconceptions like assuming 'free' software has no restrictions.
  peer_teaching: 'Pair students; one explains core concepts (e.g., types of licenses: perpetual, subscription, open-source
    like GPL which requires sharing changes vs. MIT which allows commercial use) with examples/non-examples. Partner teaches
    back the compliance audit process. Switch roles to reinforce understanding.'
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: Your startup has grown rapidly; inventory reveals 20% license over-deployments on cloud VMs.
    Vendor threatens audit. Develop a step-by-step remediation plan: asset inventory, normalization, procurement options (buy
    more licenses, switch to SaaS/open-source), and cost-benefit analysis.'
