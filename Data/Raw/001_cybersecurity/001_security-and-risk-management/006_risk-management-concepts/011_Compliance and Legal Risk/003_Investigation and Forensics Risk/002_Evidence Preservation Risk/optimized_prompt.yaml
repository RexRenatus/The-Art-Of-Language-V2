active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Analyze a real-world cyber incident like the SolarWinds hack. In groups, debate the potential evidence
    preservation risks (e.g., volatile data loss in RAM during supply chain compromise) and propose a chain of custody protocol
    to mitigate them. How does the order of volatility influence your strategy? Present findings and defend against peer critiques.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
