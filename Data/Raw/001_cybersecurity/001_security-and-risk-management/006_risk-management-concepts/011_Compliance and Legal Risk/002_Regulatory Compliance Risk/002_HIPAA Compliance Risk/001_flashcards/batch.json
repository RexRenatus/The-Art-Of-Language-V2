          "text": "To allow business associates to use PHI for marketing purposes without restriction.",

        "core_logic": "BAAs (45 CFR § 164.504(e)) are critical risk management tools that legally bind business associates to HIPAA standards, ensuring that PHI remains protected even when handled by third parties, thus extending the covered entity's risk management posture.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly suggest BAAs transfer liability, permit unrestricted use, or replace the covered entity's own risk assessment, misunderstanding their role in establishing contractual obligations for PHI protection.",
        "analogy": "A BAA is like a strict contract with a security firm guarding your valuables; it ensures they follow specific protocols to protect your assets, but you remain ultimately responsible for ensuring your valuables are secure."
