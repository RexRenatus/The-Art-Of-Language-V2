active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a debate format, argue whether the System Owner or the Authorizing Official bears more accountability
    for a system's security failure. Use NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2 as the primary reference and incorporate real-world examples
    like the SolarWinds supply chain breach. Participants must cite specific RMF steps and roles to support their position.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    like Security Officer); 2) Common misconceptions (e.g., System Owner as purely technical vs. oversight); 3) Out-of-context
    facts (e.g., Authorizing Official duties). Ensure distractors test nuance in RMF roles/steps.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST RMF and risk management
  roles. Generate 25 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''System Owner'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And

  **Research Context (Complete):** System Owner: Designated individual responsible for development, acquisition, integration,
  modification, operation, and disposal of an information system, ensuring security/privacy compliance (NIST SP 800-37 Rev.
  2). Key terms: Information System (discrete info resources); Security/Privacy Risk (harm from unauthorized actions). NIST
  RMF Steps: 1. Categorize (System Owner determines security/privacy categorization); 2. Select (controls); 3. Implement;
  4. Assess; 5. Authorize; 6. Monitor (continuous risk management). Sources: NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-37r2.pdf);
  NIST Glossary (SP 800-53); RMF Quick Start Guide.
