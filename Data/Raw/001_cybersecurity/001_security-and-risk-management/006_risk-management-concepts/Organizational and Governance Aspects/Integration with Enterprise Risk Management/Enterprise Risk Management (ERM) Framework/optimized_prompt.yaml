active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges of aligning organizational Risk Appetite with cybersecurity
    strategies in the ERM Framework. Use examples from NIST CSF 2.0 and real breaches like SolarWinds to argue for or against
    prioritizing cyber risks over financial ones. Reflect on prior knowledge from basic risk identification.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema provided. Incorporate:

  - Voter consensus: Full coverage of NIST CSF 2.0 (csrc.nist.gov/pubs/cs/wp/029/ver/1.1/final), COSO ERM (coso.org), ISO
  31000 (iso.org); 4-layer scaffolding; Bloom''s objectives; case studies (Equifax/SolarWinds); templates; concept map (ERM
  central, branches to CSRM/Risk Appetite/Registers/Standards); prior links to risk concepts.

  - Research: ERM (holistic risk process), CSRM (cyber impacts), ICT RM (OT/IoT/AI), Risk Appetite.

  - Pedagogy: Active learning ties; misconception distractors; progressive complexity.


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"front": "question", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...",
