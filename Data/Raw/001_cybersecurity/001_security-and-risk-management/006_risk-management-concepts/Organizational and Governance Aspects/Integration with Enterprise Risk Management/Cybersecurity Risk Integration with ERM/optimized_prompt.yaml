  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''All cybersecurity risks have equal business impact and
    do not require prioritization within ERM.'' Use NIST IR 8286 series evidence to support your position, referencing prior
    knowledge of COSO ERM and basic risk assessment. Identify one common misconception and propose a counterargument.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Cybersecurity Risk Integration
  with ERM'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Risk Management Concepts > Organizational and
  Governance Aspects > Integration with Enterprise Risk Management > Cybersecurity Risk Integration with ERM). Use university
  pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (objectives provided), active learning (discussion/peer teach/problem-solve), 4-layer scaffolding
  (Foundation: defs; Components: NIST breakdown; Implementation: steps; Integration: links/optimizations). Prior knowledge:
  COSO ERM, basic risk ID, cyber basics. Big picture: Unified risks for resilience. Misconceptions: CSRM isolated, equal impacts.
