active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the shift from qualitative to quantitative risk management using FAIR-O-RT. Provide examples from
    cybersecurity (e.g., SolarWinds hack) where qualitative methods fail due to subjectivity, and discuss how O-RT enables
    financially-driven decisions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate a comprehensive flashcard deck optimized for spaced repetition, active recall, and Bloom''s Taxonomy progression.
  Use this content:

  [Insert full research context: FAIR Model (Threats, Vuln, LEF=TEF×Vuln, LM=Pri+Sec), Risk Scenario, Quantitative Analysis,
  sources like cisecurity.org, fairinstitute.org].


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste array above].

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to discussion/peer-teach/problem-solving (e.g., reference SolarWinds, ransomware).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers + Prior Knowledge + Concept Map (textual: O-RT → LEF(LM|TEF×Vuln)).


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: [paste schema above]. Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''type'':
  ''MCQ/cloze/etc.'', ''bloom_level'': ''Remember'', ''layer'': ''1'', ''tags'': [''O-RT'', ''LEF'']}, ...]. Ensure 100% coverage
  of O-RT components, relationships, pros/cons, integrations (NIST/FAIR-O-RA). Make engaging, error-proof, pedagogy-driven
  for university-level learners.'
