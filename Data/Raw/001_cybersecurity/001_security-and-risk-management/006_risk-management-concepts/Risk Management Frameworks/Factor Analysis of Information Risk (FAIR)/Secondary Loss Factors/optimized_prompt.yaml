  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, analyze the Equifax data breach (2017): How did secondary losses (e.g., reputational
    damage, loss of competitive advantage) exceed primary losses in impact? Propose metrics to quantify these in FAIR and
    debate integration with NIST CSF GOVERN function.'

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MC: 1) Common misconception (e.g., classify secondary as primary),
    2) Overlap/exaggeration (e.g., minor primary as major secondary), 3) Irrelevant framework (e.g., NIST DETECT instead of
    GOVERN). Ensure distractors teach by contrast.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in FAIR risk management. Topic:\
  \ Secondary Loss Factors (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Risk Management Concepts > Risk Management\
  \ Frameworks > FAIR > Secondary Loss Factors). Use this comprehensive content:\n\n[Insert full scaffolding layers here verbatim].\n\
  \nLearning Objectives: [Insert objectives list].\nActive Learning: [Insert activities].\n\nGenerate 50 high-quality flashcards\
  \ following this EXACT schema:\n- **Card #/50: Bloom's Level | Scaffolding Layer**\n- **Front:** [Question]\n- **Back:**\n\
  \  - **Answer:** [Bold correct answer]\n  - **Explanation:** [1-2 paras, reference sources/FAIR formulas/NIST GOVERN completion,\
