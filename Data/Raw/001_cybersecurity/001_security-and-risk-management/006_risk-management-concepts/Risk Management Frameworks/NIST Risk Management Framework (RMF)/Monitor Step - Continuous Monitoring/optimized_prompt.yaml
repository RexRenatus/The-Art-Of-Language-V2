active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the effectiveness of continuous monitoring versus periodic assessments in preventing major cyber
    breaches like SolarWinds or Log4j. What role does the NIST RMF Monitor step play in adapting to zero-day threats?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
  additional_activities:
  - Think-pair-share on common misconceptions (e.g., CM eliminates need for other RMF steps).
  - Role-playing a SOC team responding to alerts in a simulated environment.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST RMF. Generate 25 high-quality\
  \ flashcards on 'Monitor Step - Continuous Monitoring' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management >\
  \ Risk Management Concepts > Risk Management Frameworks > NIST RMF > Monitor Step). \n\nIncorporate: \n- Learning Objectives:\
  \ [paste full list above]. Cover all Bloom's levels proportionally. \n- Scaffolding Layers: [paste full scaffolding above].\
  \ Tag each card with layer 1-4. \n- Active Learning: Draw from discussion/activities for scenario-based cards (e.g., healthcare\
  \ plan, SolarWinds debate). \n- Big Picture: Emphasize RMF feedback loop, resilience. \n- Sources: NIST SP 800-137 (ISCM\
  \ guide), NIST SP 800-37 Rev 2 (RMF), CMS RMF, ISO 27001 Clause 9.1/A.12.4, Scytale.ai. \n\nFollow Flashcard Schema exactly:\
  \ Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcards. Ensure variety, no repetition. Distractors from misconceptions (e.g., full\
  \ automation, ignores other RMF steps). Explanations detailed, pedagogical. Example MCQ: Front: 'What is the primary purpose\
  \ of ISCM?', Options: A: Ongoing awareness (correct), B: One-time audit (distractor), etc."
