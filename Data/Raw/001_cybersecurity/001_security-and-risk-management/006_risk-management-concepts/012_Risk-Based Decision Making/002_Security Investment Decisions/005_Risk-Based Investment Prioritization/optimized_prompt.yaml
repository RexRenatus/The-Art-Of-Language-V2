active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given a limited cybersecurity budget, debate whether to prioritize high-likelihood/low-impact risks (e.g.,
    phishing training) or low-likelihood/high-impact risks (e.g., APT defenses). Use NIST CSF 2.0 examples (e.g., Govern,
    Identify functions) to argue positions and explore risk trade-offs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs: 3 distractors per question. Make plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse
    likelihood with impact; mix compliance-driven vs. risk-based; swap NIST CSF Tiers). Distractor 1: Superficial similarity
    (e.g., another risk term). Distractor 2: Inverse concept (e.g., high-impact/low-likelihood as priority). Distractor 3:
    Outdated/compliance-focused (e.g., ''mandated by regulation''). Ensure 1-2 sentences explaining why each is wrong in the
    card explanation.'

  Topic: Risk-Based Investment Prioritization (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Risk Management Concepts
  > Risk-Based Decision Making > Security Investment Decisions > Risk-Based Investment Prioritization). Use provided research
  context: Risk-based approach prioritizes resources on highest risks via ERM integration, Cybersecurity Risk defs, Risk Prioritization,
  Response strategies (mitigate/transfer/avoid/accept) from NISTIR 8286A/B. NIST CSF 2.0: Emphasizes Govern (OV-GOV-01 Risk
  Management Strategy), Identify (ID.RA), Tiers (Partial to Adaptive). Sources: NISTIR 8286A, 8286B/upd1, NIST CSF 2.0.


  Incorporate: Learning objectives (span REMEMBER to CREATE as listed), active learning for context (e.g., debate scenarios
  for cards), scaffolding layers (distribute cards: 15% Layer1, 25% Layer2, 30% Layer3, 30% Layer4), connection mapping (prereqs,
  ERM, ROI, CISO budgeting).


  Generate flashcards per schema: Output as JSON array of objects, each with ''type'', ''front'', ''back'', ''explanation'',
  ''bloom_level'', ''layer'', ''tags'' (e.g., [''NIST'', ''ERM'']). Ensure coverage: 10+ cards per Bloom''s level pair, distractors
  plausible/misconception-based. High-quality: Precise, spaced repetition-friendly, university pedagogy (active recall, scaffolding).
  Voter priorities: Completeness (full NIST CSF), pedagogy (progressive Bloom''s), real-world apps.


  Example card: {"type":"MCQ", "front":"Which best defines risk prioritization? A) Compliance checklist B) Ranking by likelihood/impact
  C) ...", "back":"B. Explanation: Per NISTIR 8286B... Distractors wrong because...", "explanation":"Links to UNDERSTAND obj,
  Layer2.", "bloom_level":"UNDERSTAND", "layer":2, "tags":["prioritization","NIST"]}


  Output ONLY the JSON array of 50 flashcards.'
