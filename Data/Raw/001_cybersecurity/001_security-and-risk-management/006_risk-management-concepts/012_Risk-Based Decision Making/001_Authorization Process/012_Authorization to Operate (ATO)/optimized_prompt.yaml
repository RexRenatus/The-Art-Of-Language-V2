active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate whether ATO is a one-time certification or part of a continuous risk management
    lifecycle. Use RMF steps and real-world examples from FedRAMP or DoD to support your position, evaluating the implications
    for ongoing operations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Distractors plausible, derived from research/voter notes.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST RMF and Authorization
  to Operate (ATO). Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Risk Management Concepts > Risk-Based
  Decision Making > Authorization Process > Authorization to Operate (ATO). Use provided research: ATO is formal AO approval
  post-RMF Assess (SSP/SAR/POA&M review), within 7 RMF steps, for federal compliance (FISMA/FedRAMP). Correct term: ''Authorization
  to Operate''. Incorporate voter consensus (82.9% approval): Bloom''s objectives, 4-layer scaffolding, RMF details, misconceptions,
  concept map (ATO central → RMF/AO/SSP/SAR/POA&M), prior knowledge anchors.
