active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the scenarios where risk acceptance is preferable over developing a POA&M.
    Use real-world examples from federal agencies under FISMA and justify your position based on resource constraints, risk
    levels, and compliance impacts.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Use this optimized learning content to generate high-quality flashcards:


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the learning_objectives array here]


  **Active Learning:** [Insert the active_learning object here]


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the scaffolding object here]


  **Flashcard Schema:** [Insert the flashcard_schema object here]


  **Additional Guidelines:**

  - Balance cards: 25% Layer 1 (REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND), 25% Layer 2 (UNDERSTAND/APPLY), 25% Layer 3 (APPLY/ANALYZE), 25% Layer
  4 (EVALUATE/CREATE).

  - Ensure university pedagogy: Scaffold from basic recall to synthesis; promote active recall.

  - Ground in research: Use FedRAMP timelines (high:30/mod:60/low:90 days), NIST SP 800-53, FISMA, FedRAMP POA&M Template.

  - Voter consensus: Include sample templates, prior knowledge links (risk ID, SSP), step-by-step implementation.


  **Output Format:** JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''Question text'', ''back'': ''Answer + explanation + tags'', ''type'':
  ''mcq/cloze/short'', ''bloom_level'': ''REMEMBER'', ''layer'': 1, ''references'': [''NIST SP 800-53'']}, ...]. Generate
  exactly 50 cards.'
