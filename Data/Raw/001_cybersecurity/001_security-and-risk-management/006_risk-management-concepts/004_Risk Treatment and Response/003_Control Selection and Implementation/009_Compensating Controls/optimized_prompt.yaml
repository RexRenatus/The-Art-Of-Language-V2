active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate whether compensating controls can ever truly provide equivalent protection to primary controls.
    Use examples from NIST SP 800-53 (e.g., substituting procedural controls for technical ones) and real-world cases like
    PCI-DSS compliance to support your arguments. Consider factors such as cost, feasibility, and long-term risk.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  content: 'Core vocabulary: Compensating control (alternative safeguard providing equivalent protection per NIST SP 800-53r5);
    Primary control (recommended baseline control); Equivalency (comparable risk mitigation). Purpose: Used when primary controls
    are infeasible, cost-prohibitive, or inadequate.'

  focus: ''
  content: 'Key relationships: Part of risk mitigation strategies; Aligned with standards like NIST SP 800-53 (defines compensating
    controls), NIST CSF (Detect/Respond functions), PCI-DSS. Examples: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) via biometrics +
    logging instead of hardware tokens.'

  focus: ''
  content: 'Step-by-step process: 1) Assess primary control infeasibility via risk analysis; 2) Identify alternative controls;
    3) Validate equivalency (risk reduction comparison); 4) Implement, document (including rationale, monitoring plan), and
    obtain approval.'

    ''reduces risk more than primary''); 2) Related but incorrect terms (e.g., ''risk acceptance'' vs. mitigation); 3) Partial
    truths (e.g., ''cheaper but less effective''). Ensure distractors test deeper understanding (APPLY/ANALYZE levels).'
