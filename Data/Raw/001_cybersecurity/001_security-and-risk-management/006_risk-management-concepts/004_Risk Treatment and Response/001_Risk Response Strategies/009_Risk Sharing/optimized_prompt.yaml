  discussion_prompt: In a supply chain cyber incident, when should an organization opt for risk sharing with vendors (e.g.,
    collaborative monitoring per NIST SP 800-161 multilevel risk management) versus risk transfer via insurance? Support your
    view with examples from NIST CSF 2.0 or ISO 27001, and debate common misconceptions like equating sharing with avoidance.

  **Complete Research Context:**

  Risk sharing distributes cybersecurity risks among stakeholders (e.g., suppliers, partners, insurers) via collaboration.
  Differs from: transfer (financial shift, e.g., insurance), avoidance (eliminate activity), mitigation (reduce impact), acceptance
  (bear risk). Key in SCRM.

  - NIST SP 800-161 Rev. 1: Multilevel risk management – Tier 1 (organization), Tier 2 (prime suppliers), Tier 3+ (sub-suppliers);
  shared visibility, contracts for risk posture.

  - NIST CSF 2.0: Govern (GV.RM-05: Supply chain risk sharing via policies).

  - ISO 27001:2022: A.5.19-23 (supplier agreements for shared controls).

  - Best Practices: SLAs with audit rights, joint threat hunting, cyber insurance riders, CMMC for DoD chains.

  Sources: NIST SP 800-161r1 (2022), NIST CSF 2.0 (2024), ISO/IEC 27001:2022, CIS Controls v8.

  Prior Knowledge: Risk identification/assessment/prioritization.


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Use provided learning_objectives (span Bloom''s: REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND/APPLY/ANALYZE/EVALUATE/CREATE),
  active_learning activities, scaffolding_layers. Generate 40-50 flashcards following flashcard_schema exactly (mixed formats,
  distractors per protocol, explanations with sources/Bloom''s/layer/active tie-ins).


  **Formative Assessments for Flashcards:** Include 4-6 MCQs/short-answer cards mimicking: 1) MCQ: ''Risk sharing is best
  confused with: A) Avoidance B) Transfer C) ...'' (distractors on misconceptions). 2) Scenario: SolarWinds application. 3)
  Reflection: ''Evaluate sharing in supply chain.''

  ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': 1-4, ''objective_id'': 1-6}]}. Ensure even distribution across layers/objectives, high
  factual accuracy, engaging for active recall.'
