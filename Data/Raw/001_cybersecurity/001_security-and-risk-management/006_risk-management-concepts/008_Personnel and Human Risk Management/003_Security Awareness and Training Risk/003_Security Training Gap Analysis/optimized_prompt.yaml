  ## Full Research Context

  A security training gap analysis identifies discrepancies between current workforce cybersecurity competencies and required
  levels to mitigate risks. Key Concepts: Security Training Gap (current vs. required competencies); Awareness (recognize
  risks); Training (job skills); Role-Based Training; Competency (KSAs/TKS).

  Frameworks:

  - NIST SP 800-50 Rev. 1 ''Building an Effective Cybersecurity Awareness and Training Program'' (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-50r1):
  Lifecycle - Plan/Organize, Analyze/Design, Develop/Implement, Evaluate/Improve.

  - NICE Framework (NIST SP 800-181, https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice): TKS for roles; aligns with ''Federal
  Cybersecurity Role Description Catalog'' concepts.

  - NIST SP 800-53 AT controls.
