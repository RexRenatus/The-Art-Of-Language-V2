        "core_logic": "The most appropriate next step after identifying a gap in recognizing phishing is to design and develop targeted training because the analysis has clearly indicated a need for education on social engineering and reporting. This works by directly addressing the identified deficiency with relevant content and methods, aiming to improve employee behavior and reduce the risk of successful phishing attacks.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractor 1 is incorrect as it focuses on technical solutions, not the identified training need. Distractor 2 is wrong as the gap analysis has already provided a specific need. Distractor 3 is incorrect as policy updates don't replace training for skill development.",
        "analogy": "If a student consistently fails a specific type of math problem on tests (gap), the next step is to provide targeted tutoring and practice on that problem type, not to change the grading system or give them a new calculator."
