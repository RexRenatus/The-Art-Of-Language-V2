  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Exit interviews should always take priority over immediate
    access revocation during termination.'' Use NIST PS-4 to support arguments, considering voluntary vs. involuntary terminations
    and real-world risks like the Uber 2016 breach. Identify 2-3 pros/cons and propose a balanced policy.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ based on:

    - Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Exit interview first'' vs. access disable).

    - Partial truths (e.g., ''Retrieve property immediately'' - actually after access disable).

    - opposites (e.g., ''Retain access'' vs. revoke).

    Ensure plausible for cybersecurity novices; label why wrong.'
