  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the following: ''Is the need-to-know principle sufficient on its own to
    prevent insider threats, or must it always be paired with least privilege and personnel screening (PS-2/PS-3)? Use real-world
    examples like the 2013 Target breach to support your arguments.'' Encourage critical thinking by requiring participants
    to reference NIST SP 800-53 controls.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - Base on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Need-to-know grants full access to managers' vs. 'Only job-required access').
  - Use similar concepts (e.g., least privilege as distractor for need-to-know definitions).
  - Incorporate real-world errors (e.g., over-privileging in scenarios).
  - 'Ensure plausibility: 1 superficially correct, 1 reversed logic, 1 unrelated.'
  - 'Vary types: 70% MCQ with 4 options (1 correct), 20% true/false with twist, 10% scenario-based.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in the ''Need-to-Know Principle''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Risk Management Concepts > Personnel and Human Risk Management
  > Administrative Controls for Personnel > Need-to-Know Principle). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning
  activities, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema to create optimized Anki-style flashcards.


  Incorporate university pedagogy: Progress through Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning for retention, scaffolding for mastery.
  Research context: Need-to-know restricts access to job necessities (vs. least privilege: min actions); NIST SP 800-53 AC-2/AC-3/PS-2/PS-3;
  examples/misconceptions as specified.


  Generate 25 flashcards in JSON array format: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'']}, ''metadata'': {...}}]. Follow schema exactly: MCQ preferred, distractors per protocol,
  explanations reference objectives/layers/sources. Ensure completeness (e.g., full PS-2/PS-3: PS-2 assigns position risk;
  PS-3 screens personnel pre-access). Vary difficulty, link to active learning where apt.'
