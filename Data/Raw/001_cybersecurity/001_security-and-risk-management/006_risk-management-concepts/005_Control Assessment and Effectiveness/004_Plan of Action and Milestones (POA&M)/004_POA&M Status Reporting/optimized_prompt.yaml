active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a high-stakes federal agency scenario, debate when a POA&M weakness should transition from 'Ongoing'
    to 'Delayed' or 'Accepted.' What metrics (e.g., timeline slippage, risk severity) and stakeholder inputs (e.g., auditors,
    management) should drive status reporting? How does this align with FISMA and NIST SP 800-30?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    e.g., confuse ''Ongoing'' (active work) with ''Planned'' (not started); ''Delayed'' (behind schedule) with ''Accepted''
    (risk accepted). Distractors from research: partial truths, reversed logic, unrelated statuses. Ensure 1-2 highly plausible

  Incorporate this research context: POA&M tracks weaknesses from assessments/scans (NIST SP 800-53 controls). Key terms:
  Weakness (control deficiency), Milestone (SMART step), Statuses (Completed: resolved; Ongoing: in progress; Delayed: behind;
  Planned: scheduled; Accepted: risk accepted). Reporting: Frequency (quarterly FISMA), escalation for delays, templates with
  tasks/owners. NIST SP 800-30 links risk assessment to prioritization of criticality. Sources: security.cms.gov, cdse.edu,
  regscale.com, NIST SP 800-53/800-30/FISMA.
