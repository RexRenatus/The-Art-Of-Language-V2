active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how weakness tracking in POA&Ms prevents exploitation compared to reactive
    vulnerability scanning alone. Use real-world examples like CVE tracking in tools such as Nessus, and reference NIST CSF
    functions (Identify, Protect) to support your arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (40% of cards): Create 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse
    vulnerability with threat; mix NIST CSF functions; use similar acronyms like POAM vs. POA&M). Ensure distractors are realistic
    from research context (e.g., wrong CSF subcategory) but clearly incorrect per definitions.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST-aligned content. Topic:
  Weakness Tracking (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Risk Management Concepts > Control Assessment
  and Effectiveness > Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) > Weakness Tracking).


  Incorporate this optimized learning structure:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full array above]

  - Active Learning: Use elements in explanations (e.g., reference discussion scenarios).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4. Complete NIST CSF 2.0: Govern
  (risk strategy), Identify (risks/weaknesses), Protect (PR.IP-12 vulnerability mgmt), Detect (monitoring), Respond (mitigation),
  Recover (lessons learned). POA&M details: ID, actions, milestones, status, closure. Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework),
  SP 800-37 Rev 2 (RMF), SP 800-53 Rev 5 (controls), SP 800-53A (assessment).


  Generate 50 flashcards following EXACT schema: {''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''1-4'', ''distractors'': [...]}}. Cover all objectives/Bloom''s levels. Vary types:
  40% MCQ (w/ distractors), 30% definition/short answer, 20% application scenarios, 10% analysis/evaluation. Ensure pedagogical
  depth: tie to real-world (e.g., Nessus CVE tracking), prior knowledge (vuln/threat/risk), voter priorities (completeness,
  Bloom''s). Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards.'
