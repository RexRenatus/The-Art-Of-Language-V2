  Use this optimized learning content:

  [Insert full learning_objectives, active_learning_components, scaffolding_layers here verbatim].


  Generate flashcards strictly following the flashcard_generation_schema. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects, e.g.,
  [{question: ''...'', correct_answer: ''...'', bloom_level: ''apply'', explanation: ''...'', distractors: [{text: ''...'',
  explanation: ''...''}, ...]}].


  Ensure:

  - Balance across Bloom''s levels.

  - Incorporate examples (incident response, physical security, awareness training), misconceptions, NIST SP 800-37 steps,
  RMF integration, FedRAMP context.

  - Distractors: Exactly 3 per card, plausible and explained.

  - Pedagogy: Progress from remember (defs) to create (design processes).

  - No extra text outside JSON array.'
