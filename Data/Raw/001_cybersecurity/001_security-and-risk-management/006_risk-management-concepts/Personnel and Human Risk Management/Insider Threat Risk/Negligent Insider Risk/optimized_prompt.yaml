  discussion_prompt: 'Compare negligent insider risks to malicious ones: Which poses a greater challenge for organizations
    today, and why? Debate using real-world examples (e.g., phishing-induced ransomware vs. data exfiltration by a disgruntled
    employee) and NIST CSF insights. Address misconceptions that all insider threats are intentional.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Core Content (from research):** Negligent insider: unintentional harm by authorized users via error/oversight (e.g., phishing
  clicks, misconfigs). Vs. malicious (intentional). NIST CSF: Identify, Protect (training), Detect (monitoring), Respond,
  Recover. Causes: lack of awareness. Consequences: breaches/losses.
