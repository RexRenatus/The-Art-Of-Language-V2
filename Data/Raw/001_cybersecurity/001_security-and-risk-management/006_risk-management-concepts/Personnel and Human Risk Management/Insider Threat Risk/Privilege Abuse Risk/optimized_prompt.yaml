  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using this content structure:


  **Prerequisites/Big Picture:** Builds on access control/insider threats; mastering reduces 80% human-error breaches (Verizon
  DBIR).


  **Scaffolding Layers:**

  - Layer 1 (Foundation): Definitions (privilege, PoLP, abuse types, bracketing).

  - Layer 2 (Components): Relationships (PoLP mitigation, NIST AC/AU/IA).

  - Layer 3 (Implementation): Steps (RBAC, PAM, monitoring).

  - Layer 4 (Integration): NIST SP 800-53 (AC-2, AC-5, AC-6 Least Privilege, IA-2/5), sources (NIST Rev 5, Kaspersky, DBIR).


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives from above].


  **Active Learning Ties:** Weave in prompts like discussions on PoLP challenges or case analyses.


  **Output Format (JSON array of flashcards):** Each flashcard: {''front'': ''Question'', ''type'': ''MCQ|Q&A|Scenario|Create'',
  ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''... (cite layer/objective/source)'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'':
  1-4}, ''distractors'': [''A'', ''B'', ''C''] (for MCQ)}.


  **Schema Rules:** Follow distractor protocol (3 plausible); balance Bloom''s/layers; explanations pedagogical (why/why not);
  ensure active recall. Sources: NIST SP 800-53r5, Kaspersky PoLP/Bracketing, Verizon DBIR 2023.'
