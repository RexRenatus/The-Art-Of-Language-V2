active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the effectiveness of gamification versus traditional SETA in changing human behavior for cybersecurity
    risks. Debate pros (e.g., higher engagement via PBL) and cons (e.g., short-term motivation), citing NIST awareness guidelines
    and ISO 27001 controls. Support with evidence from Verizon DBIR on human error.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2. Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''PBL guarantees 100% behavior change''); 3. Confusable similar concept (e.g.,
    mix up PBL elements or NIST vs. ISO). Ensure plausibility from research/voter misconceptions.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for university-level cybersecurity education. Generate 25 high-quality
  flashcards on ''Gamification for Risk Awareness'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Risk
  Management Concepts > Personnel and Human Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training Risk > Gamification for Risk
  Awareness). Consensus: 82.9% approval.


  Incorporate:

  - Research: Gamification uses game elements (PBL) to boost SETA engagement; addresses human error (74% breaches, Verizon
  DBIR); aligns with NIST awareness and ISO 27001.

  - Prior knowledge: Link to SETA failures; analogies to games/loyalty programs.

  - Best practices: PBL examples, step-by-step implementation, case studies, ROI metrics.

  - Concept map: Central ''Gamification for Risk Awareness'' → Mechanics (PBL), Outcomes, Frameworks (NIST/ISO), Dependencies
  (training failures).
