active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of NIST standards, to what extent should organizations prioritize thorough candidate vetting
    (including continuous vetting) over individual privacy rights to mitigate insider threats? Provide examples (e.g., PIV
    credentialing) and counterarguments, addressing misconceptions like vetting being a one-time process.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
  additional_activities:
  - 'Role-playing: Simulate a vetting panel with interviews and credentialing decisions.'
  - 'Think-pair-share: Categorize risks (e.g., compare intentional vs. unintentional insider threats).'
  - 'Collaborative design: Groups create a vetting flowchart for varying role sensitivities.'

    1. Common misconception (e.g., ''Vetting is only one-time'' vs. continuous).

    2. Confusable term (e.g., ''Credentialing'' as ID proofing vs. issuance).

    3. Partial truth/extreme (e.g., ''Ignores privacy'' vs. balanced NIST approach).

    Ensure distractors are realistic from research context/voter suggestions (e.g., privacy vs. security debate).'

  **Content Summary (Complete, Web-Grounded):** Candidate vetting ensures trustworthy access to sensitive systems. Core: Personnel
  Vetting (suitability for trusted workforce, DNI.gov); Identity Proofing (verify via gov''t ID, CMS.gov); Background Investigations
  (past reliability, scoped by risk); Credentialing (issue PIV cards); Continuous Vetting (ongoing monitoring for changes
  in trustworthiness, Trusted Workforce 2.0). NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 PS Family (completed): PS-3 Personnel Screening (background
  checks pre-access); PS-4 Termination; PS-5 Transfer; PS-6 Access Agreements; PS-7 External Personnel; PS-8 Sanctions. Mitigates
  insider threats (intentional/unintentional). Sources: dni.gov/files/NCSC (Vetting Guidelines), NIST SP 800-53, cms.gov (Vetting
  Guide).
