  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages and challenges of implementing real-time risk monitoring
    versus periodic assessments in a high-threat environment like critical infrastructure. Support your arguments with references
    to NIST RMF, ISCM, and real-world breaches (e.g., SolarWinds). Identify one key trade-off and propose a hybrid solution.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Content Summary (Complete and Comprehensive):** Real-time risk monitoring is continuous observation of security posture,
  vulnerabilities, and threats for proactive decisions. Key concepts: ISCM (NIST: ongoing awareness via people/policies/processes/tech/standards);
  OA (near real-time risk-based authorizations); NIST RMF ''Monitor'' step (https://www.nist.gov/rmf); NIST CSF ''Detect''
  function (complete: Identify occurrences of cybersecurity events by continuous monitoring of systems/networks/assets; https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework).
  Tools: SIEM, dashboards. Implementation: Metrics, automation. Integration: AI/ML, zero trust. Sources: NIST ISCM guide (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/137/r1/final),
  OA supplemental (https://nist.gov/publications/supplemental-guidance-ongoing-authorization-transitioning-near-real-time-risk),
  RMF (https://www.nist.gov/rmf), CSF (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), FCC critical infrastructure (https://www.fcc.gov/cybersecurity).


  **Prior Knowledge:** RMF Prepare/Categorize, periodic assessments, threat modeling.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives from above].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full scaffolding from above, including concept map].


  **Active Learning Context:** Use objectives and layers to inspire scenario-based cards tying to discussions/activities.


  **Generate 50-75 flashcards following the exact schema:**

  - Balance across layers, Bloom''s levels, types.

  - Ensure active recall: Challenging questions, no cues on front.

  - Ground in research/sources; make explanations pedagogical (e.g., ''This aligns with NIST SP 800-137'').

  - Output as JSON array of flashcard objects.


  Example Output: [{''front'': ''What is ISCM?'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''Maintaining ongoing awareness...'', ...}}]


  Prioritize completeness, progressive complexity, measurable outcomes, and voter consensus (84.3% approval).'
