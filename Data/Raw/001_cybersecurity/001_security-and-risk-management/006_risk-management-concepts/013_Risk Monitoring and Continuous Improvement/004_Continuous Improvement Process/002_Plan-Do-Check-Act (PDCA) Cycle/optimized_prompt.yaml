active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the role of PDCA in achieving cybersecurity resilience. How does it contribute
    to long-term risk reduction and adaptive security postures? Consider challenges like resource constraints in the Do stage
    and share examples from NIST CSF or ISO 27001 compliance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Distractor 2: Plausible but incomplete (e.g., omit KPIs in Plan).'
    - 'Distractor 3: Reverse stage (e.g., Act before Check).'
    - Ensure distractors teach via explanation; base on real errors from cybersecurity contexts like skipped Check in breaches.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Risk Management Concepts.
  Use the provided topic: Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) Cycle (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management >
  Risk Management Concepts > Risk Monitoring and Continuous Improvement > Continuous Improvement Process > Plan-Do-Check-Act
  (PDCA) Cycle). Voter consensus (100% approval) emphasizes completeness (NIST CSF full alignment: Plan=Identify/Protect,
  Do=Detect/Respond, Check=Analyze, Act=Recover/Improve/Govern), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression), scaffolding (4 layers),
  prior knowledge (scientific method/incident response), big picture (resilience/compliance), and active learning.


  Core Content:

  - Foundation: Definitions, links to scientific method, big picture (ISO 27001 cl.10.2).

  - Components: Plan (goals/KPIs), Do (implement/track), Check (analyze data), Act (standardize/adjust).

  - Implementation: Examples (patch mgmt, phishing).

  - Integration: NIST CSF/ISO, automation. Sources: cyberpilot.io, ictinstitute.nl, NIST CSF 2.0, ISO 27001:2022.
