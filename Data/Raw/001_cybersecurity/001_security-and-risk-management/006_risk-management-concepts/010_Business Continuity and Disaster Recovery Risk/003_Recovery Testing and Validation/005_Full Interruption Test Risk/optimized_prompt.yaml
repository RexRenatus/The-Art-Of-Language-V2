active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given the high risks of full interruption tests (e.g., data loss, downtime, privacy exposure), should
    organizations prioritize them over less disruptive alternatives like parallel testing? Debate pros/cons using real-world
    case studies (e.g., banking sector outages), considering RTO/RPO impacts.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains a specific risk (e.g., unintended data corruption or privacy exposure) and
    its mitigation; the partner teaches it back, adds a peer-generated example, and rates confidence (1-5). Rotate roles for
    2-3 risks.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A banking firm plans a full interruption DR test during peak hours. Design a step-by-step test
    plan minimizing risks, including RTO/RPO calculations, backups, stakeholder notifications, and fallback procedures. Present
    and peer-review.'
  additional_activities:
  - 'Role-playing: Simulate a DR team during a test failure (think-pair-share initial responses).'
  - 'Group challenge: Create a ''risk scorecard'' comparing test types (full interruption vs. parallel) on criteria like downtime,
    cost, and validation depth.'

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions: 1. Overly optimistic (e.g., ''No downtime
    risk''); 2. Confused concepts (e.g., mix with parallel tests); 3. Partial truth (e.g., ignores privacy). Ensure plausible,
    stem from voter/research errors (e.g., incomplete privacy risks). Balance coverage: 40% basic/cloze, 60% MCQ.'

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste array above]

  - Active Learning: Use for context/inspiration (e.g., scenario-based cards from problem-solving).

  - Scaffolding: Structure content across 4 layers [paste scaffolding above]. Ensure prior knowledge (BCP/DR basics).

  - Research Context: Full interruption test simulates complete outage for BCP/DR validation. Risks: Data loss/corruption,
  extended downtime, privacy exposure (e.g., unsecured backups), operational impacts. Mitigations: Backups, notifications,
  etc. Sources: Web searches on BCP/DR testing (e.g., NIST SP 800-34, ISACA guidelines).


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using schema: [paste schema above]. Balance Bloom''s levels (2 remember/understand,
  8 apply/analyze, 15 evaluate/create). 60% MCQs with distractors. Embed active learning (e.g., debate prompts as fronts).
  Formative: Include 3 MCQs on misconceptions.
