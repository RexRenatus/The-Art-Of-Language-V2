This is because biometric data alone does not provide sufficient confidence and can be vulnerable to spoofing, thus requiring an additional factor for robust security.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly suggest biometrics can be standalone, should be centrally stored without privacy caveats, or should prioritize speed over NIST's defined accuracy requirements, all contradicting the guidelines.",
        "analogy": "Using biometrics alone is like having a fingerprint scanner on your front door but no lock; it's a cool feature, but you still need a strong lock (physical authenticator) for real security."
