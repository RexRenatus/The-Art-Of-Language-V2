This is vital because tokens are the primary assets and interaction points in many blockchain applications.",

Therefore, careful consideration of data storage and privacy-enhancing techniques is a prerequisite for secure blockchain implementations.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The correct answer directly addresses the privacy issue arising from the public and transparent nature of blockchains. The distractors propose issues related to data accessibility, denial-of-service attacks, and smart contract functionality, which are not the primary privacy concerns of visible access logs.",
