active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of implementing BYOD policies in a mid-sized enterprise.
    Consider how device loss risks impact sensitive data protection and propose mitigations based on NIST SP 800-124.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Topic: Device Loss Prevention (Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training > Threat Awareness and Prevention > Physical
  and Environmental Threats > Device Loss Prevention). Voter Consensus: 87.1% approval, priorities include Bloom''s objectives,
  4-layer scaffolding, NIST completeness (SP 800-124 Rev. 2: mobile lifecycle guidelines; CSF: Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover),
  best practices (encryption, remote wipe, training), case studies (e.g., Sony 2014), concept map.


  Research Context: DLP prevents sensitive data (PII/PHI/IP) loss from endpoints via strategies/tech. BYOD risks data exfiltration.
