      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Unsecured USB drives pose an eavesdropping risk because the data stored on them is typically unencrypted and accessible if the drive is lost or stolen. This works by allowing anyone who gains physical possession of the drive to read its contents directly, bypassing network security.",

        "analogy": "Transferring sensitive files on an unsecured USB is like carrying important documents in an open folder; anyone who sees the folder can read the documents."

        "core_logic": "TEMPEST refers to standards for preventing compromising emanations (like electromagnetic signals) from being intercepted, thus mitigating eavesdropping.
