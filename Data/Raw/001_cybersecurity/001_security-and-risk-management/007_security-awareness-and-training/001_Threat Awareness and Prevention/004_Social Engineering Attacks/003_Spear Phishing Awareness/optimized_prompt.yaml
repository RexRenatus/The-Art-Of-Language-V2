active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent can technical controls like DMARC replace user awareness training in defending against
    spear phishing? Debate with evidence from NIST/CISA guidelines and real-world examples, addressing misconceptions like
    'personalized emails are always safe.'
  peer_teaching: Students pair up; one teaches the differences between phishing, spear phishing, and social engineering using
    core definitions and examples, then switch roles for teach-back with quiz questions.
  problem_solving: Provide 3 sample emails (1 generic phishing, 1 spear phishing, 1 legitimate); in groups, identify red flags,
    tactics, and response strategies (e.g., verify sender, check URLs, report).

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors that are common misconceptions or close-but-wrong (e.g., for SPF: ''Encrypts
    email content'' instead of ''Verifies sender IP''; use voter/addressed errors like confusing phishing types). Ensure plausible
    based on research context.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards
  on ''Spear Phishing Awareness'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Awareness and
  Training > Threat Awareness and Prevention > Social Engineering Attacks > Spear Phishing Awareness). Use the provided research
  context, voter consensus (100% approval: complete SPF/DKIM/DMARC explanations, Bloom''s objectives, active learning, 4-layer
  scaffolding, concept maps), and big picture (reduces human error in NIST/CISA risk management).


  Core Content:

  - Definitions: Spear phishing (targeted, personalized via research); Phishing (broad); Social Engineering (manipulation);
  Malware; Spoofing.

  - Protocols: SPF (Sender Policy Framework: checks sender IP vs. domain SPF record to prevent spoofing); DKIM (DomainKeys
  Identified Mail: cryptographic signatures verify message integrity/authenticity); DMARC (Domain-based Message Auth/Reporting/Conformance:
  policy on SPF/DKIM fails, e.g., reject/quarantine, reports abuse).

  - Concept Map: Central ''Spear Phishing'' → Tactics (spoofing+personalization), Defenses (training+protocols), Standards
  (NIST/CISA).
