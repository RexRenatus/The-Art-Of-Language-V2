  discussion_prompt: 'In groups, debate: ''Is pretexting more dangerous than phishing due to its personalization? Use Verizon
    DBIR statistics (90% breaches involve social engineering) and MITRE ATT&CK techniques to support your position.'' Encourage
    critical thinking on prevention trade-offs.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
