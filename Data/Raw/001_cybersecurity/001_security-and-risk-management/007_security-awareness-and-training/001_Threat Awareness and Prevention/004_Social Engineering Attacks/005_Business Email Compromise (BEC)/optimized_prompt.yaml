active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the most vulnerable role in an organization to BEC attacks (e.g., finance
    vs. executives) and propose two evidence-based prevention measures, citing FBI IC3 loss data ($43B globally) and psychological
    factors like urgency.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  ''Business Email Compromise (BEC)'' in the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Awareness
  and Training > Threat Awareness and Prevention > Social Engineering Attacks > BEC. Big picture: BEC training prevents $43B
  FBI-reported global losses via awareness.


  Incorporate prior knowledge: Builds on phishing/spear-phishing/email spoofing.
