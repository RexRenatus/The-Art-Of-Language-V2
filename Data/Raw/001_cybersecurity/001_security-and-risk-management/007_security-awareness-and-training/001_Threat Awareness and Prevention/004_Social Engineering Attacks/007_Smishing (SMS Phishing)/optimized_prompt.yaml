    - explain
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Analyze the effectiveness of smishing compared to email phishing. What psychological factors (e.g., immediacy,
    perceived trustworthiness of texts) make SMS more or less effective, and how can organizations counter these through training
    and technology?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Similar but incorrect term (e.g., ''email phishing'' instead of ''SMS phishing''), (3) Partial truth (e.g., valid prevention
    but wrong context). Ensure plausible to test analysis, not trivia.'

  Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training > Threat Awareness and Prevention
  > Social Engineering Attacks > Smishing (SMS Phishing). Voter consensus (100% approval): Emphasize complete types (account
  verification, package delivery, bank alerts, prize scams), prevention strategies, Bloom''s progression, active learning.


  Incorporate this content:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT active_learning OBJECT HERE]

  - Scaffolding: Use 4 layers progressively - [INSERT scaffolding OBJECT HERE]

  - Research: Smishing exploits SMS trust via spoofed urgent messages (e.g., prizes, deliveries) leading to malware/data theft.
  Prevention: Verify officially, report.


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards (10 per lower/mid/higher Bloom''s: remember/understand/apply/analyze; evaluate/create).
  Cover all layers, types, prevention, comparisons. Balance: 50% MCQ, 50% basic/cloze. Ensure active recall, no verbatim copies.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards matching this schema: [INSERT flashcard_schema STRUCTURE HERE]. Vary difficulty,
  include distractors per protocol. Tie explanations to objectives/layers for scaffolding.'
