  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: 'In pairs, one student explains NIST SP 800-63B AAL levels (AAL1: single-factor; AAL2: MFA with tokens/smart
    cards; AAL3: phishing-resistant) using diagrams. Partner provides teach-back quiz; switch roles and discuss real-world
    applications.'
  problem_solving: Design an MFA system for a bank using tokens/smart cards to address phishing risks. Include enrollment
    protocols, PIN management, federation with external systems, and risk-based auth triggers. Present solution and peer-review
    for NIST compliance.
