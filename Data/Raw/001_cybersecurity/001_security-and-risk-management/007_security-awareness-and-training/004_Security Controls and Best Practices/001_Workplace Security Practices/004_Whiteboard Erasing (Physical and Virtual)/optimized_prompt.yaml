active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the relative risks of physical vs. virtual whiteboard data leaks in a hybrid
    work environment. Reference NIST SP 800-88 levels and real-world examples like Miro's data retention policies. What mitigations
    would you prioritize and why?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Always generate EXACTLY 3 distractors. Make them plausible based on common errors (e.g., confusing
    Clear with Destroy, overlooking virtual persistence). Each distractor must have ''text'' (concise) and ''explanation''
    (1-2 sentences). Ensure variety: one conceptual mix-up, one procedural error, one risk underestimation.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education on ''Whiteboard Erasing (Physical and Virtual)''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training > Security Controls and
  Best Practices > Workplace Security Practices > Whiteboard Erasing). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives
  [insert learning_objectives array here], active learning activities [insert active_learning here for inspiration], 4-layer
  scaffolding [insert scaffolding here].


  Generate 20-30 high-quality flashcards in EXACT JSON array format: [{''front'': ''Question?'', ''back'': {''correct_answer'':
  ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [{''text'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...''}, ... (EXACTLY 3)]}}].


  Follow flashcard_schema strictly: Multiple choice, plausible distractors (3 only, with text/explanation), detailed explanations
  referencing NIST SP 800-88 (Clear/Purge/Destroy), MP-6, virtual tools (Miro/Microsoft Whiteboard), risks (shoulder surfing,
  persistence), compliance (GDPR), and scaffolding layers. Progressively scaffold cards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer
  3, 25% Layer 4. Balance Bloom''s levels. Ensure JSON is parseable, no extra text.'
