active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the balance between usability and security in asset storage practices. Using NIST SP 800-53 controls,
    argue whether organizations should prioritize encryption over physical media controls in a workplace setting handling
    CUI, citing potential data breach risks and real-world examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    without access controls''), (2) Partial truth (e.g., ''AES-128'' instead of ''AES-256''), (3) Unrelated but similar term
    (e.g., ''Classified info'' vs. ''CUI''). Ensure correct answer is definitively superior based on NIST standards.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education. Generate 25 high-quality, spaced-repetition
  optimized flashcards for the topic ''Secure Asset Storage'' (Category: Cybersecurity, Domain: Security And Risk Management,
  Subdomain: Security Awareness and Training, Entry Domain: Security Controls and Best Practices, Entry Subdomain: Workplace
  Security Practices). Topic Hierarchy: Level 1: Cybersecurity > Level 2: Security And Risk Management > Level 3: Security
  Awareness and Training > Level 4: Security Controls and Best Practices > Level 5: Workplace Security Practices > Level 6:
  Secure Asset Storage.


  Incorporate university-style pedagogy: Use provided Learning Objectives (spanning Bloom''s REMEMBER to CREATE), Active Learning
  components (discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving), Scaffolding (4 layers: Foundation, Components, Implementation,
  Integration), and Prior Knowledge (CIA triad, asset ID, data classification).


  Key content: CIA triad, CUI protection, NIST SP 800-53 (MP, AC, SC families), NIST SP 800-88 sanitization, encryption (AES-256),
  RBAC, storage types (block/file/object/cloud), best practices (encrypt at rest, audits), breaches, zero-trust, AWS KMS.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: Anki format (Front/Back), mix types (recall, MCQ, analysis), distractor protocol, full
  explanations with evidence/Bloom''s/layer/active tie-in.


  Distribute coverage: 30% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 20% Layer 4. Ensure active recall, no cues on front. Output
  as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''type'': ''MCQ/Recall/Analysis'', ''blooms_level'': ''...'', ''layer'':
  ''...''}]. Make engaging, accurate, and misconception-proof.'
