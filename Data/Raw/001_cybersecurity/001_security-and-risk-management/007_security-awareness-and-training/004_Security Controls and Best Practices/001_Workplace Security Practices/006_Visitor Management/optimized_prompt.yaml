active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue for or against implementing digital badges for all visitors versus traditional
    paper badges, considering cybersecurity risks (e.g., spoofing), cost, convenience, and alignment with NIST CSF Protect
    function.
  peer_teaching: 'Teach-back exercise: One student explains VMS components (pre-registration, check-in, escort, log-out) and
    their NIST relationships to a partner, who then summarizes with a personal or hypothetical workplace example and receives
    feedback.'
  problem_solving: 'Real-world scenario: A delivery person tails a visitor into a secure area, leading to a data breach. In
    teams, design a step-by-step prevention protocol using NIST CSF Protect and Detect functions, including logging and response
    measures.'
  additional_activities:
  - 'Role-playing simulation: Pairs act out a visitor check-in process with one as receptionist and one as visitor; peers
    provide feedback on security gaps.'
  - 'Think-pair-share: Identify the riskiest visitor types (e.g., contractors vs. VIPs) and justify using risk analysis from
    NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2.'

    - Plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Visitors never need escorts' for tailgating risk).
    - Partial truths (e.g., correct for physical but wrong for digital access).
    - Reversals (e.g., swap NIST functions like Protect vs. Detect).
    - Edge cases (e.g., VIP exceptions without controls).
    - Outdated practices (e.g., paper-only badges ignoring digital risks).

  **Full Research Context:** Visitor management ensures non-employees (visitors: contractors, clients, etc.) are identified,
  screened, and managed for physical/digital access. Core: VMS (pre-registration, ID verification, badges, escorts, logging,
  NDAs, revocation). Risks: tailgating, social engineering. NIST CSF (Identify: assets/threats; Protect: access controls;
  Detect: monitoring; Respond/Recover/Govern: incident handling/policy). NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2 RMF: Prepare (org-level), Categorize
  (system), Select (controls e.g., SP 800-53 AC-2/PE-3), Implement, Assess, Authorize, Monitor. Best practices: photo ID,
  background checks, CCTV integration, AI VMS. Sources: NIST CSF (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), SP 800-37 Rev. 2 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/37/r2/final),
  SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final).


  **Concept Map:** Central: Visitor Management → VMS (branches: pre-reg, check-in, etc.) → Risk Mitigation → NIST CSF (Identify→Protect→Detect)
  → RMF Steps.


  Incorporate these learning objectives [insert learning_objectives array], active learning [reference activities for scenario
  questions], and 4 scaffolding layers [insert scaffolding_layers array].


  Generate 25 flashcards using the exact schema: {question, options: [''A. ...'', ''B. ...'', etc.], correct_answer: ''A (explanation
  with NIST ref, why distractors wrong)'', explanation, bloom_level, scaffolding_layer, topic_hierarchy}. Follow distractor
  protocol strictly. Ensure flashcards progress pedagogy: foundation questions first, then build to integration/create. Balance
  Bloom''s levels. Output as JSON array of objects.'
