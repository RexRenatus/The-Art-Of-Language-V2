    <discussion_prompt>In a group debate, argue for or against implementing digital badges for all visitors versus traditional paper badges, considering cybersecurity risks (e.g., spoofing), cost, convenience, and alignment with NIST CSF Protect function.</discussion_prompt>
    <peer_teaching>Teach-back exercise: One student explains VMS components (pre-registration, check-in, escort, log-out) and their NIST relationships to a partner, who then summarizes with a personal or hypothetical workplace example and receives feedback.</peer_teaching>
    <problem_solving>Real-world scenario: A delivery person tails a visitor into a secure area, leading to a data breach. In teams, design a step-by-step prevention protocol using NIST CSF Protect and Detect functions, including logging and response measures.</problem_solving>
    <additional_activities>
      <activity>Role-playing simulation: Pairs act out a visitor check-in process with one as receptionist and one as visitor; peers provide feedback on security gaps.</activity>
      <activity>Think-pair-share: Identify the riskiest visitor types (e.g., contractors vs. VIPs) and justify using risk analysis from NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2.</activity>

    <system_prompt>You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Visitor Management under Security Awareness and Training. Use the provided topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity &gt; Security And Risk Management &gt; Security Awareness and Training &gt; Security Controls and Best Practices &gt; Workplace Security Practices &gt; Visitor Management.
**Full Research Context:** Visitor management ensures non-employees (visitors: contractors, clients, etc.) are identified, screened, and managed for physical/digital access. Core: VMS (pre-registration, ID verification, badges, escorts, logging, NDAs, revocation). Risks: tailgating, social engineering. NIST CSF (Identify: assets/threats; Protect: access controls; Detect: monitoring; Respond/Recover/Govern: incident handling/policy). NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2 RMF: Prepare (org-level), Categorize (system), Select (controls e.g., SP 800-53 AC-2/PE-3), Implement, Assess, Authorize, Monitor. Best practices: photo ID, background checks, CCTV integration, AI VMS. Sources: NIST CSF (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), SP 800-37 Rev. 2 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/37/r2/final), SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final).
**Concept Map:** Central: Visitor Management → VMS (branches: pre-reg, check-in, etc.) → Risk Mitigation → NIST CSF (Identify→Protect→Detect) → RMF Steps.
Incorporate these learning objectives [insert learning_objectives array], active learning [reference activities for scenario questions], and 4 scaffolding layers [insert scaffolding_layers array].
Generate 25 flashcards using the exact schema: {question, options: ['A. ...', 'B. ...', etc.], correct_answer: 'A (explanation with NIST ref, why distractors wrong)', explanation, bloom_level, scaffolding_layer, topic_hierarchy}. Follow distractor protocol strictly. Ensure flashcards progress pedagogy: foundation questions first, then build to integration/create. Balance Bloom's levels. Output as JSON array of objects.</system_prompt>
