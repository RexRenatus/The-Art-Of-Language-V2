active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How might peer influence contribute to phishing susceptibility in a workplace? Debate whether positive
    social norms (e.g., 'everyone uses MFA') can be engineered to counter negative ones (e.g., 'sharing passwords saves time').
    Use real-world examples like the 2020 Twitter hack and address misconceptions like 'tech-savvy people are immune.'
  peer_teaching: In pairs, Student A teaches Student B core concepts of social norms vs. peer influence using a cybersecurity
    analogy (e.g., 'norms are like traffic rules, peer influence is friends speeding'). Switch roles; include teach-back where
    B summarizes, questions, and addresses misconceptions like influence only affecting youth.
  problem_solving: In groups, analyze a scenario (e.g., office where 'sharing login credentials is normal' leads to a breach).
    Identify social engineering vectors influenced by norms, design interventions like peer-led training, and apply to learners'
    own environments.
  additional_activities:
  - 'Role-playing: Simulate peer pressure in social engineering (e.g., colleague urging to click a link); debrief exploited
    norms.'
  - 'Think-pair-share: Share personal examples of peer-influenced security lapses.'
  - 'Collaborative project: Create a ''norm-shifting'' poster campaign for security culture.'

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ based on voter examples and common errors: (1) Confuse with other influences
    (e.g., authority vs. peers), (2) Unrelated/misconceptions (e.g., hardware vs. behavior; legal only), (3) Partial truths
    (e.g., direct commands only). Ensure plausible for cybersecurity novices.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security Awareness and

  **Topic Hierarchy:** Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training > Human Factors and
  Behavioral Security > Security Culture and Climate > Peer Influence and Social Norms.


  **Research Context:** Core concepts: Social influence (thoughts/actions changed by others); Social norms (group expectations);
  Peer influence (from similar peers); Cybersecurity culture (shared security behaviors); Social engineering (psychology manipulation).
  Manifestations: (1) Adoption of security practices (likely if peers normalize); (2) Risk perception (threats dismissed if
  norm); (3) Social engineering susceptibility (peer trust exploited); (4) Alert dismissal (if ''everyone ignores''). Sources:
  [dsnlab.web.unc.edu], [sciencedirect.com], [lifelock.norton.com]. Examples: Phishing, password sharing, 2020 Twitter hack.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives from above].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers from above].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Embed scenarios from discussion (phishing debate), peer teaching (analogies), problem-solving
  (breach analysis), role-play (simulations).

  - Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''mcq|basic|cloze'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''tags'': ''[Bloom:...]
  [Layer:...] [Source:...]''}]

  - Balance types/levels/layers/objectives.

  - Distractors: 3 per MCQ, protocol as specified.

  - Explanations: Tie to pedagogy, correct misconceptions, promote active recall.

  - Ensure university-level: Scaffolding progression, Bloom''s alignment, voter-inspired MCQs (e.g., ''Peer influence best
  defined as: a) authority... b) similar status (correct)...'').

  Prioritize recall, application in cyber contexts.'
