        "core_logic": "NIST SP 800-12 defines 'tone from the top' as the critical influence of management's commitment, attitudes, and actions on the organization's security culture, because when leaders prioritize and demonstrate security awareness, it signals its importance to employees, encouraging them to adopt similar behaviors and fostering accountability.",

        "analogy": "In a family, the parents' attitude towards rules (e.g., healthy eating, homework) sets the 'tone' for the children's behavior, more so than just handing them a rulebook."
