active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare the roles of an Incident Commander versus a Communications Officer in a cybersecurity emergency
    response to a DDoS attack on a financial institution. Which role is more critical in the first 24 hours, and why? Use
    NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 guidelines to support your debate, considering factors like decision-making authority and stakeholder
    impact.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs: 3 distractors that are plausible but incorrect. Base on: 1) Similar roles (e.g., confuse
    Technical Analyst duties with Forensic), 2) Overlaps from real guidelines (e.g., partial responsibilities), 3) Common
    errors (e.g., attributing leadership to communicators), 4) Out-of-context alternatives (e.g., from CSF Identify function).
    Ensure 1 correct answer is unambiguous.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Emergency Response Roles
  under the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training > Specialized

  Key content from NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 and CISA: Focus on roles like Incident Commander (leadership/decisions), Communications
  Lead (messaging), Triage Analyst (prioritization), Technical Analyst (investigation), Forensic Specialist (evidence), Response
  Coordinator (operations). Integrate with CSF Respond/Recover.
