active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In groups, debate the scenarios where a PIA is mandatory (e.g., under GDPR) versus recommended (e.g.,
    internal projects), and how it links to prior cybersecurity risk concepts. Support arguments with real-world examples
    from sources like OAIC.gov.au.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Always exactly 3 distractors per MCQ. Base on common misconceptions: 1) Overly broad/narrow definitions;
    2) Confusion with related terms (e.g., PIA vs DPIA); 3) Ignoring context (e.g., sensitive vs general PII). Explain each
    why wrong, citing research (e.g., OAIC definitions). Ensure plausible but incorrect.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university pedagogy (Bloom''s
  Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Topic: Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA). Category: Cybersecurity > Security And
  Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training > Specialized Topics and Emerging Areas > Privacy and Data Protection
  > Privacy Impact Assessment.


  Research Context: [Insert full provided research summary here, including truncated BII as ''Business Identifiable Information
  (BII): In the context of the U.S. Department of Commerce, this refers to trade secrets and commercial or financial information
  identifying business operations.'' Sources: OAIC.gov.au links, NIST Privacy Framework (nist.gov/privacy-framework), GDPR
  DPIA (gdpr.eu). Big picture: PIA enables proactive privacy risk mitigation, mastering Security and Risk Management.


  Prior Knowledge: Basic risk management, PII identification, cybersecurity risks.


  Use these EXACT learning objectives: [paste array from learning_objectives]. Scaffolding layers: [paste from scaffolding].
  Active learning for context: [paste summaries].


  Generate 25 flashcards per flashcard_schema. Cover all Bloom''s levels/objectives, layers evenly. Ensure voter priorities:
  pedagogy (measurable), completeness (full NIST/ERM), scaffolding (4 layers), concept map refs, schema (exact 3 distractors
  w/ exps).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''type'': ''MCQ|Cloze|ShortAnswer'', ''bloom_level'': ''REMEMBER'', ''layer'':
