    - 'Related concepts: Mix with similar terms (e.g., distractor: ''Privacy by Policy'' instead of ''Privacy by Design'').'
    - 'Partial truths: Accurate for lower principles but wrong for higher (e.g., ''Reactive approach'' for proactive principle).'
    - 'Real-world pitfalls: From cases like TikTok (over-collection as distractor).'
    - 'Avoid: Obvious wrongs, unrelated terms. Ensure 1-2 high-plausibility distractors per MCQ.'

  Generate 50-60 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/spaced repetition, following the exact schema: Front (question),
  Back (answer, explanation, bloom_level, layer, related_objectives, concept_map_hint).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM JSON]

  - Active learning: Use examples from discussions/problems for higher-level cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute evenly across 4 layers: [PASTE FULL LAYERS FROM JSON].

  - 7 Foundational Principles: Proactive, Default, Embedded, Positive-sum, End-to-end, Transparency, User-centric – test explicitly.

  - Prior knowledge: Link to GDPR basics.

  - Concept map: Central PbD → PbDf, Data Minimisation, etc.

  - Sources: ICO.org.uk (Data Protection by Design/Default, Data Minimisation).


  Flashcard rules:

  - Balance: 40% short answer/cloze, 30% cloze deletion, 30% MCQ.

  - Bloom''s progression: 30% Remember/Understand, 40% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate/Create.

  - Distractors: [PASTE FULL PROTOCOL FROM JSON].

  - Explanations: 2-4 sentences, pedagogical (why wrong/right), active recall boosters.

  - Make engaging: Real-world (TikTok, smart home), measurable/SMART.


  Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'',
  ''layer'': 1, ''related_objectives'': [1,3], ''concept_map_hint'': ''PbD → Principles''}}]. Ensure comprehensive coverage,
  no duplicates.'
