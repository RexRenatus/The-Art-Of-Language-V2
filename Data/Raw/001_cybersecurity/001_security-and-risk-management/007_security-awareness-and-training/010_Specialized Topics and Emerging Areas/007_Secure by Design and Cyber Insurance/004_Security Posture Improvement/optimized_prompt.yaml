active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the most critical NIST CSF 2.0 function (e.g., Govern vs. Detect) for improving security posture
    in small businesses versus large enterprises, using real-world examples like the SolarWinds breach (Detect/Respond focus)
    or Equifax (Identify/Protect gaps). Consider organizational size, resources, and regulatory requirements.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
