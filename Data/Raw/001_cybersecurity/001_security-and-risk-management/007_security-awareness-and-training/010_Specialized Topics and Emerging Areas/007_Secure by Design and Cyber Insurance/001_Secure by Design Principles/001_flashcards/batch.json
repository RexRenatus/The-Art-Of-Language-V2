        "core_logic": "Defense-in-depth is a Secure by Design tactic because it creates multiple layers of security, functioning by ensuring that if one layer fails, others can still protect the system. This prevents a single point of failure from leading to a complete breach.",

        "core_logic": "The 'burden of security' principle dictates that manufacturers must own security outcomes because it ensures products are built securely from the start, functioning by integrating security into the product's lifecycle.
