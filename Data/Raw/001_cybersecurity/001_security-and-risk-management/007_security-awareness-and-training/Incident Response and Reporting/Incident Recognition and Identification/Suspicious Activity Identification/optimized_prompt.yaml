active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between minimizing false positives in anomaly detection
    and ensuring timely threat identification. Use real-world examples like unusual login spikes during off-hours and reference
    NIST CSF Detect processes to support your arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - D1: Common misconception (e.g., normal activity mislabeled suspicious).

    - D2: Plausible but irrelevant (e.g., related to another CSF function like Protect).

    - D3: Extreme/overgeneralized (e.g., always high-risk without context).

    Ensure plausible, educationally valuable; avoid randomness.'
