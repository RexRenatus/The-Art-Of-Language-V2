active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the consequences of delayed security violation reporting using real-world
    examples like the Equifax breach. Argue for or against mandatory reporting timelines (e.g., 72 hours per GDPR) and propose
    improvements for organizational culture.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 2-3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., confuse ''event''
    with ''incident''), 2) Partial truths from adjacent CSF functions (e.g., mix DE reporting with RS), 3) Real-world edge
    cases (e.g., vulnerability disclosure as internal only). Ensure distractors are 70% plausible to challenge learners without
    frustrating.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security Violation Reporting
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training > Incident Response and
  Reporting > Incident Reporting Procedures > Security Violation Reporting).


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema. Cover the full topic comprehensively, completing truncated
  research: Core concepts (event, adverse event, incident, vulnerability disclosure, incident response); NIST SP 800-61r3
  lifecycle; NIST CSF 2.0 full functions (Govern GV: policies; Identify ID: risks; Protect PR: controls; Detect DE: anomaly
  detection/analysis/reporting e.g., DE.AE-01, DE.AE-05; Respond RS: analysis/comms e.g., RS.CO-02 reporting; Recover RC:
  lessons learned). Procedures: Who (SOC/CSIRT), What/When/How. Integration: metrics, legal (e.g., CISA, GDPR).
