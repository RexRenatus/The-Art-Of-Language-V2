active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, select one NIST CSF 2.0 Govern subcategory (e.g., GV.RM Risk Management Strategy or GV.PO Policy).
    Explain it to your partner using a real-world example of leadership leading by example, then switch roles and provide
    feedback.
  problem_solving: In groups, design a 'leadership action plan' for a fictional company facing phishing risks. Incorporate
    4-6 lead-by-example principles (e.g., leaders publicly advocating training), map to NIST GV categories, and present resource
    allocation decisions via role-play of a board meeting.

    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors: 1. Common misconception (e.g., ''Cybersecurity is IT''s sole job''), 2. Partial truth
      (e.g., related but wrong category), 3. Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Leaders must do all tasks'').'
    - Ensure similar length/format to correct answer.
    - Avoid obvious errors; base on voter-noted gaps (e.g., incomplete NIST categories).
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Topic: ''Lead by Example Principles'' (Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training > Program Management and Governance > Leadership
  and Organizational Culture > Lead by Example Principles). Use this full content [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING LAYERS CONTENT
  HERE, INCLUDING NIST GV CATEGORIES, KEY PRINCIPLES, SOURCES: ncsc.gov.uk/cyber-security-culture-principles, nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.29.pdf,
  NIST CSF 2.0 docs]. Incorporate learning objectives [LIST], active learning [LIST], and scaffolding layers progressively.


  Prerequisites: Basic risk management. Ensure completeness (full NIST GV: OC, RM, RR, PO, OV).


  Generate flashcards per schema: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD SCHEMA]. Output ONLY in JSON array of objects, each with ''type''
  (basic_qa/mcq), ''bloom_level'', ''layer'', ''front'', ''back'' (as structured). Aim for high pedagogy: active recall, spaced
  repetition friendly, distractors per protocol. Voter priorities: completeness, Bloom''s progression, active elements.'
