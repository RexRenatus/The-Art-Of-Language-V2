        "core_logic": "NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2's guidance to decrease effort on low-impact systems (if they pose no risk to higher-impact systems) directly benefits budget and resource allocation by enabling more efficient distribution of limited security resources. This allows organizations to concentrate their funds and personnel on higher-risk areas where security failures would have a more significant impact, thereby optimizing the overall security budget for maximum risk reduction.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly suggest eliminating controls, mandating consolidation, or reducing the overall budget, failing to grasp that the core benefit is optimizing resource allocation by focusing efforts on higher-risk systems where they will have the greatest impact.",
        "analogy": "A police department allocating its patrol cars: it might assign fewer patrols to a very quiet, low-crime neighborhood (low-impact system) if it's isolated, allowing more patrols to focus on high-crime areas (higher-impact systems) where they are most needed."
