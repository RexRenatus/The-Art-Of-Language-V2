active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of RBRA versus generic risk assessments in reducing human-error
    breaches (which account for ~70% of incidents). Provide real-world examples, such as finance sector role audits post-SolarWinds
    attack, and propose how RBRA enhances Security Awareness and Training.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., confuse RBRA with
    RBAC); 2) Partial truths (e.g., asset-based vs. role-based); 3) Voter-suggested gaps (e.g., ignore privileges); 4) Research
    context (e.g., mix NIST CSF with HITRUST). Ensure distractors test deeper understanding.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Role-Based Risk Assessment
  (RBRA) under Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training > Program Management
  and Governance > Program Design and Development > Role-Based Risk Assessment. Voter consensus: 82.9% approval, priorities:
  Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives, 4-layer scaffolding, prior knowledge (NIST 800-30, RBAC, least privilege), big picture (role-tailored
  training reduces 70% human-error breaches), examples (exec spear-phishing vs. developer code injection), complete standards
  (NIST CSF Govern, HITRUST CSF v2 for role controls, ISO 27001 A.9).


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema: {front, type, options (if MCQ), back: {correct_answer, explanation,
  bloom_level, scaffolding_layer, related_objective, active_learning_link}}. Balance: 30% Layer1/Remember-Understand, 40%
  Layer2-3/Apply-Analyze, 30% Layer4/Evaluate-Create. Use MCQ (80%) with distractors per protocol (plausible errors: RBRA≠RBAC,
  asset vs role focus). Explanations: Tie to research (definitions, processes), voter suggestions, real-world (SolarWinds
  finance audits).


  Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]. Scaffolding Layers: [insert full descriptions above]. Active Learning: Use
  for context in explanations/links.


  Incorporate: Prior Knowledge section in Layer1 flashcards; completeness (full HITRUST: supports RBRA via role-specific Govern
  controls); pedagogy progression.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcards, no extra text.'
