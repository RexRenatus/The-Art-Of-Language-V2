active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the misconception that 'security awareness is sufficient without targeted
    training.' Use real-world examples (e.g., phishing incidents) to argue for tailored ISEAT programs under Annex A 6.3,
    and propose metrics to evaluate program impact.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [PASTE FULL ARRAY FROM ''learning_objectives'']

  - Active learning: Use elements in explanations (e.g., ''Discuss in peer teaching'').

  - Scaffolding: Generate 10-12 cards per layer: [PASTE FULL ''scaffolding'' DETAILS]. Ensure completeness: Cover full ISEAT
  lifecycle (needs assessment, development, delivery methods like e-learning/workshops, evaluation metrics, continuous improvement).

  - Prior knowledge: Link to ISMS (Clauses 4-10), Annex A.5.

  - Voter priorities: Examples/case studies (e.g., phishing reduction), misconceptions (e.g., awareness ≠ training), 2013
  vs 2022 comparison.
