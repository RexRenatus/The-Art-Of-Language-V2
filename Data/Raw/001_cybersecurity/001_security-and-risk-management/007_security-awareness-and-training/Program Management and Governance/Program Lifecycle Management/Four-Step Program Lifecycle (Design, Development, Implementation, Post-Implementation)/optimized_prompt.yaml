active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate which lifecycle phase (Design, Development, Implementation, or Post-Implementation) is most overlooked
    in cybersecurity awareness programs and why, using evidence from NIST CSF (e.g., Recover function) or ISO 27001 Annex
    A.8 (awareness requirements).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    is only for failures''); 2) Confusable phase/element (e.g., mix Design with Development activities); 3) Partial truth/overgeneralization
    (e.g., NIST CSF function mismatched to phase). Ensure distractors teach by contrasting in explanations.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security Awareness and
  Training under Program Lifecycle Management. Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Awareness
  and Training > Program Management and Governance > Program Lifecycle Management > Four-Step Program Lifecycle (Design, Development,
  Implementation, Post-Implementation). Consensus: 67.1% approval from 7 voters emphasizing completeness, pedagogy, and big-picture
  context.


  Research Context: Four-step lifecycle for cybersecurity programs (e.g., awareness training). Phases: Design (objectives/scope);
  Development (build components); Implementation (deploy); Post-Implementation (monitor/improve). Standards: NIST SP 800-61
  Rev2 (https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-61/rev-2/final) - incident handling aligns; NIST SP 800-37 Rev2 (https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-37/rev-2/final)
  - RMF lifecycle; NIST CSF (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) - functions map to phases; ISO 27001/27002 (https://www.iso.org/standard/27001);
  CIS Controls v8 Control 14 (https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/security-awareness-training) - comprehensive awareness programs
  with design/dev/impl/ongoing review.
