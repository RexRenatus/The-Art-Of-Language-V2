active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains Security Champion selection criteria (e.g., enthusiasm over technical expertise,
    communication skills), then the partner teaches it back with original examples from their own organization or hypothetical
    scenarios.
  problem_solving: In groups, design a Security Champion rollout plan for a company recovering from a recent phishing breach.
    Include selection process, training modules, engagement strategies, success metrics (e.g., reduction in human-error incidents),
    and integration with existing awareness programs.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create distractors that are realistic errors: 1) Overemphasis on tech skills (vs. soft skills), 2)
    Confusion with formal security roles, 3) Ignoring metrics/ongoing support, 4) Misaligning with frameworks (e.g., OWASP
    vs. compliance-only). Ground in research/voter suggestions for plausibility.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Security Champions as
  Cultural Advocates'' in the hierarchy: Level 1 Cybersecurity > Level 2 Security And Risk Management > Level 3 Security Awareness
  and Training > Level 4 Human Factors and Behavioral Security > Level 5 Security Culture and Climate > Level 6 Security Champions
  as Cultural Advocates.


  Incorporate research context: Security Champions are departmental advocates promoting security culture (clickarmor.ca).
  Key frameworks: OWASP Security Champions Guidebook (owasp.org/projects/www-security-champions-guide), NIST Cybersecurity
  Framework (emphasis on culture). Best practices: Selection (enthusiasm, communication > tech background), training, support,
  metrics. Big picture: Reduces 70% human-error breaches via scaled advocacy. Prior knowledge: Anchors on Security Culture
  basics.


  Learning Objectives: [REMEMBER: Define... CREATE: Design...] (use exactly these).


  Active Learning tie-ins: Reference discussion on resistance, peer teaching on selection, problem-solving on rollout in explanations.


  Scaffolding: Strictly layer content [Layer1: Foundation... Layer4: Integration] (use exactly these).


  Voter Consensus (100%): Emphasize measurable objectives, complete best practices (selection criteria, training, measurement),
  sources.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: Output ONLY a JSON array of 25-30 flashcards, each with id, type, question, answer, distractors
  (MCQ only), explanation, bloom_level, layer, tags. Ensure comprehensive coverage, no duplicates, educationally optimal (active
  recall, spaced repetition friendly).'
