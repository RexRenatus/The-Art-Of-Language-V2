active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how a weak security culture (e.g., as seen in the Equifax breach of 2017)
    can undermine technical controls aligned with NIST CSF. Provide evidence from real-world cases and propose cultural interventions
    to achieve organization-wide alignment. Encourage critical thinking by challenging peers' assumptions about ERM integration.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    4) Extreme/opposite (e.g., ''Security culture irrelevant to posture''). Ensure plausible for cybersecurity learners.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Organization-Wide Security
  Alignment (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training > Human Factors

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Active Learning: [summarize: discussion on culture breaches, peer-teach CSF/ERM, problem-solve alignment scenarios]

  - Scaffolding: [insert full 4 layers above, including prior knowledge, concept map, examples, sources]


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet: Spanning all Bloom''s levels (even coverage), scaffolding
  layers (12-13 per layer), objectives. Ensure progression: simple recall in Layer 1 to synthesis in Layer 4. Include concept
  map elements (e.g., ''What branches from central node?''). Variety: 20% Remember/Understand (QA/cloze), 40% Apply/Analyze
  (MCQ scenarios), 40% Evaluate/Create (critique/design MCQ).


  Strictly follow Flashcard Schema: [insert full schema above]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, no extra text. Ensure
  web-grounded accuracy (e.g., NIST CSF 2.0 exact functions/Tiers). Tags always include topic hierarchy.'
