active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: 'In pairs, one learner explains the difference between ''access purpose'' (the ''why'') and ''authorization''
    (the ''what''), using teach-back: Partner rephrases and provides an example linked to PoLP/RBAC. Switch roles and discuss
    NIST SP 800-53 integration.'
  problem_solving: Analyze 3 access request scenarios (e.g., employee requesting database access for 'personal project research',
    'ad-hoc reporting for manager', 'routine quarterly audit'). In small groups, vote approve/deny, justify using verification
    steps and NIST controls (AC-2, AC-3), then role-play requester-verifier interviews.

    2. Partial truth (e.g., omits verification step); 3. Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., assumes always hinders productivity).
    Base on voter priorities and research gaps (e.g., truncated NIST). Ensure distractors promote analysis.'
