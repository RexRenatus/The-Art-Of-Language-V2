active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of relying solely on antivirus software versus a multi-layered
    defense (e.g., updates, user training, firewalls) for virus prevention. Use NIST CSF functions to support arguments and
    evaluate real-world case studies like ransomware attacks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Ensure distractors test nuance without being obvious.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy\
  \ (Bloom's Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic 'Virus Recognition and\
  \ Prevention' in Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training > Threat Awareness and Prevention\
  \ > Malware and Malicious Code > Virus Recognition and Prevention.\n\nIncorporate:\n- Learning Objectives: [insert full\
  \ list from 'learning_objectives']\n- Active Learning: Tie flashcards to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving for reinforcement.\n\
  - Scaffolding: Distribute evenly across 4 layers: [insert full scaffolding details].\n- Prior Knowledge: Anchor to IT basics\
  \ (files/executables), malware intro.\n- Content Coverage: Virus types (viruses/worms/trojans/ransomware), signs (pop-ups/slowdown/file\
  \ changes), prevention (AV/updates/phishing avoidance), NIST CSF (functions: Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover; Ransomware\
  \ Profile), HITRUST CSF (awareness/training controls), CIA triad, best practices.\n- Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework),\
