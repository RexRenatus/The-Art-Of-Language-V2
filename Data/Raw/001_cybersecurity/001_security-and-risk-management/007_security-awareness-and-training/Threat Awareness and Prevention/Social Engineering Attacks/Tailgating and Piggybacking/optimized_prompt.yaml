active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In pairs, debate whether physical tailgating (e.g., following through a door) or digital piggybacking
    (e.g., session hijacking via XSS on public Wi-Fi) poses a greater risk to organizations today. Provide real-world examples
    (e.g., CrowdStrike-reported incidents), counterarguments, and evidence from regulatory compliance perspectives to spark
    critical thinking.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on ''Tailgating and Piggybacking''
  (Category: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training > Threat Awareness and Prevention
  > Social Engineering Attacks > Tailgating and Piggybacking).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste the full learning_objectives array here].

  - Active Learning: [Paste discussion_prompt, peer_teaching_activity, problem_solving_exercise].

  - Scaffolding: Use 4 layers progressively (Layer 1: Foundation definitions/prior knowledge; Layer 2: Components/methods/risks;
  Layer 3: Implementation/attacks/mitigations; Layer 4: Integration/big picture/CISSP context). Tag each card with layer.

  - Research Context: Tailgating (physical following); Piggybacking (accompanying/digital session exploitation via session
  hijacking, XSS, phishing, unattended devices, flawed logouts - CrowdStrike). Risks: Unauthorized access, data breaches,
  regulatory non-compliance. Mitigations: Awareness training, MFA, session timeouts, mantraps.

  - Concept Map: Central Tailgating/Piggybacking -> Physical/Digital Methods -> Risks -> Mitigations.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly:

  - Anki format: {''front'': ''Question/Prompt'', ''back'': ''Answer + Explanation'', ''type'': ''recall|mcq|cloze'', ''blooms_level'':
  ''Remember|etc.'', ''layer'': ''1-4'', ''objective_link'': ''#1-6''}.

  - 50 cards: Distribute across objectives/layers (10 per layer min), 50% MCQ with distractor protocol.

  - Output as JSON array of 50 objects. Ensure measurable, engaging, no hallucinations.'
