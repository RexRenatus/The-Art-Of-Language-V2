active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a world of evolving eavesdropping techniques like EM side-channels (TEMPEST) and acoustic attacks,
    debate whether encryption alone is sufficient for protection or if physical (e.g., Faraday cages) and behavioral measures
    (e.g., secure Wi-Fi habits) are equally critical. Use real-world examples like public Wi-Fi sniffing versus historical
    TEMPEST exploits to challenge misconceptions that 'encryption = invincible.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions: (1) Semantic confusion (e.g.,
    mix red/black data), (2) Overgeneralization (e.g., ''Encryption prevents all side-channels''), (3) Partial truth (e.g.,
    ''Wireshark only for attackers''). Ensure distractors are realistic from research context (e.g., confuse packet sniffing
    with encryption failure).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Eavesdropping Threats''
  in Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training > Threat Awareness and Prevention > Network
  and Communication Threats.


  **Topic Context (Integrate Fully):** Eavesdropping is unauthorized interception of communications/data. Key concepts: side-channel
  attacks (exploit physical leaks like EM, acoustic), red data (unencrypted sensitive), black data (encrypted), compromising
  emanations. Types: packet sniffing (capture network packets, esp. unencrypted), wiretapping (physical line taps), wireless
  sniffing (Wi-Fi), EM side-channels (TEMPEST: capture device emissions), acoustic. Mitigations: VPNs, HTTPS, encryption,
  shielding (Faraday, TEMPEST standards). Voter priorities: Complete EM/TEMPEST details, countermeasures, big picture in awareness
  training. Prior knowledge: Packets, Wi-Fi, encryption basics.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list from above].


  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Reference discussion (encryption sufficiency), peer teaching (threat types), problem-solving
  (Wi-Fi scenario) in explanations.


  **Scaffolding:** Ensure coverage: [Insert full scaffolding descriptions].


  **Output Exactly:** JSON array of 40-50 flashcards matching schema: {''flashcards'': [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''correct_answer'':
  ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [...]}}, ...]}.
  Balance Bloom''s levels and layers. Use distractor protocol. Make explanations educational, research-grounded, and actionable.'
