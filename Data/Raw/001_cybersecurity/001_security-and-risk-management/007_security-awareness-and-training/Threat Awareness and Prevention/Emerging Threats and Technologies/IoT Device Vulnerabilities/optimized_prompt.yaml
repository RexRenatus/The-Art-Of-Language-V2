active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between IoT convenience (e.g., smart home automation) and
    security risks. Use examples of real-world breaches (e.g., Mirai botnet) to argue for or against mandating stricter regulations
    on IoT manufacturers. Link to prior knowledge of basic authentication and network security concepts.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education on ''IoT Device Vulnerabilities'' (Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training > Threat Awareness and Prevention > Emerging
  Threats and Technologies > IoT Device Vulnerabilities). Use this comprehensive research context (completed for fullness):


  IoT Device Vulnerabilities: IoT devices (sensors/software connected online) have unique risks due to constraints. Key vulnerabilities:
  1) Weak Authentication/Authorization (default/weak passwords, no MFA). 2) Insecure Network Services (open ports, unencrypted
  protocols like HTTP). 3) Insecure Interfaces (UI/API flaws). 4) Insufficient Data Protection (unencrypted storage/transmission).
  5) Lack of Secure Update Mechanisms (no auto/patched firmware). 6) Physical Security Weaknesses (devices deployed in unsecured
  areas, no tamper detection, easy access). 7) Supply Chain Risks (compromised components). Threats: Bots (Mirai), DoS, data
  theft. Mitigations: Change defaults, encrypt (TLS), segment networks, regular updates, physical safeguards, vet suppliers
  (OWASP IoT Top 10).


  Incorporate 100% voter consensus: Bloom''s objectives, 4-layer scaffolding (Foundation: terms; Components: vulns; Implementation:
  procedures e.g., firmware updates/segmentation; Integration: policies/comparisons), prior links (auth/network basics), completed
  physical section, concept map (central ''IoT Vulns'' → types → threats/mitigations), MCQs with misconception distractors.
