active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss the risks of poor document version control in cybersecurity (e.g., using outdated policies during
    an incident). What real-world breaches (e.g., Equifax) could have been mitigated with better practices? Share examples
    from your experience or NIST case studies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate plausible distractors based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Version control is only
    for code, not policies''); 2) Partial truths (e.g., confuses audit trail with access logs); 3) Edge cases (e.g., tools
    irrelevant to security docs); 4) Voter-suggested gaps (e.g., ignoring RMF integration). Ensure distractors promote critical
    thinking.'

  **Topic Hierarchy:** Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training > Training Frameworks
  and Methodologies > Learning Management Systems and Tools > Document Version Control.


  **Research Context:** Document version control systematically manages changes to security documents (policies, procedures)
  for integrity/compliance. Core concepts: Document lifecycle, version history, audit trail, access control. Standards: NIST
  CSF 2.0 (Govern: ID.GV-1 policy management); NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2 RMF (versioned artifacts for Prepare/Categorize/Monitor/Authorize;
  supports ATO via audit trails). Tools: Git (branching for policy variants), SharePoint (workflows), LMS (e.g., Moodle version
  history). Best practices: Approval workflows, automation. Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), NIST
  SP 800-37r2 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-37r2.pdf).


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the full learning_objectives array here].


  **Scaffolding:** Generate flashcards distributed across 4 layers: [Insert full scaffolding details].


  **Active Learning Ties:** Reference discussion (risks), peer teaching (lifecycle), problem-solving (audit failures) in explanations.


  **Flashcard Generation:** Create 40 high-quality flashcards (10 per scaffolding layer). Use the exact schema: {''front'':
  ''...'', ''back'': {''correct'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [...], ''full_explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'',
  ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''related_standard'': ''...''}}. Ensure progression: Layer 1 basic recall; Layer 4 synthesis.
  Distractors per protocol. Prioritize voter consensus: Git analogy, NIST completions, real-world exercises. Output as a numbered
  JSON array.'
