  discussion_prompt: 'Debate: Is short-term awareness training focused on recognition (e.g., phishing cues) more effective
    than long-term behavioral change programs for reducing phishing success rates? Support arguments with evidence from NIST
    SP 800-53 AT-2 (Awareness Training) and real-world data like 2023 phishing stats (e.g., Verizon DBIR). Groups of 4: 10-min
    prep, 15-min debate, vote on winner.'
  peer_teaching: 'In pairs, one partner presents a real-world phishing email example (e.g., from NIST resources or 2023 MOVEit
    variants), explaining 5 recognition cues (sender mismatch, urgency, attachments). Partner quizzes with 3 questions, then
    switch roles. Debrief: Share common misconceptions via think-pair-share.'
  problem_solving: 'Analyze the 2023 MOVEit breach: Groups review scenario (file transfer vuln exploited via phishing), identify
    short-term recognition failures (e.g., ignored warnings), propose 3 SETA fixes (e.g., sim training), and map to NIST CSF
    2.0 PR.AT. Output: 1-slide summary with metrics (e.g., reduce clicks by 20% in sims).'
