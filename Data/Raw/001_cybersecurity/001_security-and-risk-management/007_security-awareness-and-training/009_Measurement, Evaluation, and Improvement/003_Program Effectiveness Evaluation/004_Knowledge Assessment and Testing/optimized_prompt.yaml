active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In groups, debate 'To what extent do knowledge tests predict real-world security behaviors?' Use NIST
    CSF Govern (GV) function for oversight and real breach case studies (e.g., Equifax data breach due to poor awareness)
    to argue for or against mandatory annual testing. Synthesize group consensus into a one-page policy recommendation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Use this optimized content:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST ABOVE]

  - Active Learning Activities: [INSERT FULL DETAILS ABOVE] – Ensure flashcards support these (e.g., scenario questions for
  discussions).

  - Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL 4 LAYERS ABOVE] – Distribute flashcards evenly across layers.


  Research Context: Focus on NIST CSF PR.AT (Awareness and Training: e.g., PR.AT-2 for skills/knowledge), GV (Govern), metrics
  (pass rates, retention, pre/post deltas, behavioral), methods (quizzes, phishing sims, gamified tests). Builds on basics
  like phishing/password training. Case: Equifax breach.
