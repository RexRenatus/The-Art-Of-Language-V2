active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether focusing on human error defects (e.g., phishing susceptibility) or technical
    vulnerabilities (e.g., unpatched software) yields greater returns in cybersecurity risk reduction. Use real-world examples
    like the Equifax breach (technical defect in patching) or SolarWinds supply chain attack (technical and process defects),
    and reference standards like NIST SP 800-53 or CIS Controls to support your position.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    threat); (2) Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Risk is just vulnerability''); (3) Extreme/unrealistic option (e.g.,
    ''Defects are always human error''). Ensure distractors are web-research grounded (e.g., from NIST definitions) and test
    subtle distinctions.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, aligned with Bloom''s Taxonomy,
  active learning, and Anki/Spaced Repetition best practices. Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Defect Analysis
  and Reduction'' in Cybersecurity (Domain: Security and Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training > Measurement,
  Evaluation, and Improvement > Metrics and Reporting). Full Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management

  **Core Content (Research-Grounded Summary):** Defect Analysis: Systematic identification/examination of root causes of vulnerabilities/errors/flaws
  in systems/software/processes/human actions leading to incidents. Defect Reduction: Implementing controls to eliminate/mitigate
  recurrence, reducing attack surface and enhancing resilience. Key Terms: Vulnerability (weakness exploitable by threat);
  Threat (potential adverse event); Risk (threat x vulnerability x impact). Processes: RCA (5 Whys, Fishbone), PDCA cycles.
  Authoritative Sources: NIST SP 800-53 (Rev 5: Vulnerability Scanning/RA-5); NIST SP 800-30 (Risk Assessments); ISO/IEC 27001
  (Annex A.16: Incident Management, Clause 10: Improvement); CIS Controls v8 (Control 7: Continuous Vulnerability Management);
  NIST Cybersecurity Framework (ID.RA: Risk Assessment); CISSP Domain 1 (Security & Risk Management); OWASP Top 10 (software
  defects).


  **Pedagogical Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full array from ''learning_objectives'' above].

  - Scaffolding: Generate flashcards distributed across 4 layers: [Insert full details from ''scaffolding_layers'' above].
  Aim for 20-30% per layer, progressing from low to high Bloom.

  - Active Learning Tie-Ins: Incorporate prompts referencing discussion (human vs technical defects), peer teaching (RCA analogies),
  problem-solving (SolarWinds/Equifax scenarios) in scenario-based cards.


  **Generation Rules:** Follow exact ''flashcard_schema'' above. Ensure atomic, active recall-focused content (no lists; one
  idea per card). Use precise, exam-style language (CISSP/NIST). Vary difficulty: 30% Remember/Understand, 40% Apply/Analyze,
  30% Evaluate/Create. Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''Question'', ''back'': ''Answer | Explanation | Bloom:
  Level | Layer: # | Source: NIST SP...''}]. Generate 80 unique flashcards total, balanced across layers/formats. No duplicates;
  maximize retention via interleaving concepts.'
