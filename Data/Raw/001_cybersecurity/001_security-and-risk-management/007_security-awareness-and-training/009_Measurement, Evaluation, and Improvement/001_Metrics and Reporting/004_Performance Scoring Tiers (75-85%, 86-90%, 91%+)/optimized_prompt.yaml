active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the optimal NIST CSF Implementation Tier targets for high-risk vs. low-risk organizations in security
    awareness training. Cite breach case studies (e.g., Equifax for Tier 1 risks, SolarWinds for Tier 2/3 gaps) and propose
    adaptations for metrics like phishing click rates.
  peer_teaching: 'In pairs, Student A explains the characteristics and risk management implications of one NIST CSF Tier (e.g.,
    Tier 3: Repeatable) in the context of security awareness metrics; Student B teaches it back using a real-world example
    from training quizzes or NIST SP 800-55, then switch roles.'
  problem_solving: Given mock employee data (e.g., 75-85% average quiz scores, 20% phishing click rate), assign an NIST CSF
    Implementation Tier, analyze influencing factors, and propose tier-specific interventions (e.g., targeted training for
    Tier 2 advancement).

  Tiers (aligned to NIST CSF Implementation Tiers: Partial, Risk Informed, Repeatable, Adaptive). Note: Original 75-85%, 86-90%,
  91+% are illustrative for training quizzes (e.g., NIST SP 800-55, KnowBe4), not standard; focus on NIST qualitative Tiers.
