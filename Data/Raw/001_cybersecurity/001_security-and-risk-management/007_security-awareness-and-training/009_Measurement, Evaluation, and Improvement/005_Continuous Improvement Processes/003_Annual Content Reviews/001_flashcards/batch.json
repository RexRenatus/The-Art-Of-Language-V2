      "correct_answer": "The CSF provides a high-level structure for managing cybersecurity risk, and training content should align with its core functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) and relevant subcategories.",
      "distractors": [
        {
          "text": "The CSF is a set of technical controls that dictates the specific software used for training.",

        {
          "text": "The CSF requires training content to be updated quarterly, regardless of other factors.",

      ],
      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The NIST CSF provides a strategic approach to cybersecurity risk; therefore, training content should be aligned with its functions (e.g., 'Protect' function requires training on access control and data security) because this ensures training addresses key risk areas identified by the framework.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors mischaracterize the CSF as purely technical, impose an unfounded rigid schedule, or exclude its relevance to human factors, failing to grasp its role as a guiding framework for comprehensive cybersecurity risk management, including awareness.",
        "analogy": "The NIST CSF is like a city planning guide for safety; training content should align with its goals, such as ensuring citizens know how to 'Protect' themselves (like locking doors) and 'Respond' to emergencies (like fire drills)."
