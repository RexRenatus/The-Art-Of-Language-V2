        "core_logic": "Identifying the root cause of a vulnerability is significant because it allows organizations to implement systemic fixes, preventing similar vulnerabilities from being introduced in the future, since addressing the underlying flaw is more effective than repeatedly patching symptoms. This functions by analyzing the fundamental coding or design error that enabled the vulnerability.",
