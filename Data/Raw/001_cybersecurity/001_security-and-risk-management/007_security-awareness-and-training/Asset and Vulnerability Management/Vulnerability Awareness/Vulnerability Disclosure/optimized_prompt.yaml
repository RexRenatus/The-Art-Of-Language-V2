active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the pros and cons of immediate public disclosure versus coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD).
    Use case studies like Heartbleed (where rushed disclosure led to widespread exploitation) and Log4j (rapid coordination
    minimized damage) to support arguments. How does this balance security, ethics, and public interest? (Encourages critical
    thinking and evaluation at Bloom's higher levels.)
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ using: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''immediate public disclosure
    is always best''), 2) Partial truths (e.g., mixes CVD steps), 3) Real-world case confusions (e.g., Heartbleed as ''successful
    CVD'' vs. flawed). Ensure distractors promote analysis/evaluation.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Vulnerability Disclosure
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training > Asset and Vulnerability
  Management > Vulnerability Awareness > Vulnerability Disclosure). Synthesize high-quality flashcards using university pedagogy:
  Bloom''s Taxonomy (cover all 6 levels via provided objectives), active learning (discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving),
  4-layer scaffolding (Foundation/Components/Implementation/Integration), and voter consensus (case studies: Heartbleed/Log4j;
  standards: NIST SP 800-216, CERT/CC, ISO/IEC 29147, CISA; misconceptions; concept map: Central ''Vulnerability Disclosure''
  branches to CVD/PSIRT/VDP/dependencies; prior knowledge links).


  Core Content (from research): Vulnerability (system weakness); Disclosure (responsible reporting/remediation); CVD (collaborative
  private-to-public); PSIRT (vendor team); VDP (policy for reports). Standards complete. Cases: Heartbleed (2014 rushed),
  Log4j (2021 coordinated).

  Generate flashcards per schema: [Insert full schema]. Output ONLY in JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'',
  ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': 1, ''source'': ''...''}]. Ensure progression: Start with Layer 1 Remember, build to
  Layer 4 Create. Balance: 1/6 per Bloom''s level. Use measurable verbs, real-world ties, high-quality distractors.'
