        "core_logic": "The modularity attribute of the NICE Framework means its building blocks can be adapted or extended to describe other types of workforces beyond core cybersecurity, because this flexibility allows organizations to use a consistent approach for various enterprise functions like privacy or risk management.",

        "analogy": "Modularity in the NICE Framework is like LEGO bricks; you can use them to build a cybersecurity structure, but the same bricks can also be used to build other types of models (e.g., privacy, risk management)."
