      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Improved security performance includes assessing and managing risks within the supply chain. By implementing due diligence and security requirements for third-party vendors, organizations reduce the likelihood of breaches originating from compromised suppliers, thereby protecting their own systems and data, as emphasized in NIST SP 800-53.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors propose that security increases reliance on unvetted vendors, negates supply chain assessments, or increases supplier data access, all of which are contrary to secure supply chain practices.",
        "analogy": "Carefully vetting the ingredients and suppliers for a restaurant (security performance) ensures the quality and safety of the food served to customers (protecting the organization)."
