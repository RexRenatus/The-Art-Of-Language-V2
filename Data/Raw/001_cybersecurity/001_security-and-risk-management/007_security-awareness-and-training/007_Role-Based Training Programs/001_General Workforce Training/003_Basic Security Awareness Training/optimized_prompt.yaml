  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use for scenario inspiration.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers.

  - Research Context: NIST SP 800-50 Rev. 1 (lifecycle: planning/analysis/design/development/implementation/assessment/improvement;
  audiences: all/privileged); NICE Framework (workforce roles, awareness as foundation); goals: reduce human risks (74% breaches
  per stats), build culture. Sources: NIST.gov/sp800-50, nice.gov/framework.
