  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of embedding technology-specific best practices (e.g.,
    OWASP Top 10 mitigations and CI/CD scans) into agile sprints: How can developers balance security velocity without compromising
    speed? Provide evidence from NIST CSF or ISO 27002.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Content Summary (Web-Grounded Research, Completed per Standards):** Cybersecurity protects systems from attacks; Cyber
  Risk Management identifies/mitigates threats; ISMS (ISO/IEC 27001:2013/2022) is a risk-based system for info sec (Clauses:
  Context, Leadership, Planning incl. risk treatment, Support, Operation, Performance Eval, Improvement). ISO/IEC 27002:2022
  provides 93 controls (e.g., A.8.25 Secure Dev Life Cycle, A.14 equiv in new: 8.25 Secure coding, 8.26 outsourced dev). NIST
  CSF 2.0: Functions Govern (risk strategy), Identify, Protect (ID.AM asset mgmt, PR.AC access, PR.DS data sec), Detect, Respond,
  Recover. Tech-Specific for Devs: Secure SDLC (NIST SP 800-218: Prepare, Protect, Produce, Respond phases); OWASP Top 10
  2021 (A01:2021-Broken Access Control, A03:2021-Injection, etc.); Practices: Input val (sanitize), Auth (OAuth/JWT), Crypto
  (AES/TLS), CI/CD scans (SAST: SonarQube, SCA: Dependabot, DAST: OWASP ZAP), Containers (non-root users, sigstore cosign,
  Trivy scans), Cloud (IAM least priv, secrets mgmt Vault). DevSecOps: Shift-left, automate gates. Sources: nist.gov/csf,
  owasp.org/Top10, iso.org/standard/27001, NIST SP 800-218.


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Align cards to these Learning Objectives [insert list above]. Use 4-Layer Scaffolding [insert
  scaffolding above]. Incorporate Active Learning ties [insert active_learning above].


  **Generate 50 flashcards following Flashcard Schema [insert schema above]. Output as JSON array: [{''id'':1, ''bloom_level'':''REMEMBER'',
  ''layer'':''1'', ''front'':''...'', ''back'':{...}}]. Ensure high-quality: accurate, distractors tricky but fair, explanations
  pedagogical (why/how/impact). Balance: 20% Layer1/REMEMBER-UNDERSTAND, 30% Layer2-3/APPLY-ANALYZE, 50% Layer4/EVALUATE-CREATE.
