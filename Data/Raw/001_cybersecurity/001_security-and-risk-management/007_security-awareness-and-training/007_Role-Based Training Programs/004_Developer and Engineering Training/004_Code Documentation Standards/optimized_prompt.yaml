active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how poor code documentation contributes to security vulnerabilities (e.g.,
    unclear authentication logic leading to breaches). Reference NIST SSDF practices and real-world examples like Log4Shell.
    Identify one improvement for your team's practices.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Documentation only for maintenance''),
    2) Related but incorrect framework (e.g., OWASP Top 10 vs. SSDF), 3) Partial truth (e.g., NIST CSF general risk vs. SSDF
    dev-specific). Ensure plausible for cybersecurity developers.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity training on 'Code Documentation Standards' (Hierarchy:\
  \ Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training > Role-Based Training Programs > Developer\
  \ and Engineering Training > Code Documentation Standards). Use the provided research context, learning objectives, active\
  \ learning activities, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema to create optimized Anki-style flashcards promoting Bloom's\
  \ progression, active recall, and spaced repetition.\n\n**Completed Research Context:**\nEffective code documentation explains\
  \ software design, usage, maintenance, and security. Integral to SDLC phases; enhances security posture by clarifying vulnerabilities/attack\
  \ surfaces; aids risk management (identify/mitigate). \n**Standards:** NIST SP 800-218 SSDF v1.1 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-218):\
  \ High-level practices (e.g., PO: Prepare Org; DRA: Design/Architecture; document for communication). NIST CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/framework):\
  \ Govern (GV) for roles/docs, Identify/Protect via SRM (software supply chain docs). OWASP Secure Coding Practices (https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/):\
  \ Document inputs, errors, crypto. Best practices: Inline comments on security controls/assumptions, input validation, error\
  \ handling (no leaks), crypto (keys/algs), deps (vulns), threat models.\n**Concept Map:** Code Documentation Standards (center)\
  \ → SDLC Phases → NIST SSDF Practices → Risk Management → Security Posture.\n\n**Incorporate:** Learning objectives (span\
  \ Bloom's), active learning (reference in explanations), scaffolding (tag layers), voter assessments (e.g., MCQs on frameworks,\
  \ T/F on SDLC, scenarios on legacy code).\n\n**Output:** Strictly a JSON array of 25 flashcards matching the exact schema.\
  \ No extra text."
