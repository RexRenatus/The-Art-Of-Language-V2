active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges of defining 'normal' behavior in dynamic cloud environments
    and evaluate how evolving baselines affect the effectiveness of anomaly detection systems. Support your arguments with
    real-world examples like insider threats or zero-day exploits.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1 based on common confusion (e.g., signature-based as anomaly), 1
    on opposite/extreme (e.g., always benign), 1 on partial truth (e.g., correct method but wrong context). Ensure plausible
    for cybersecurity learners. 40% flashcards as MCQ, 60% open recall/application.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education on ''Anomalous Behavior Detection'' (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training > Incident Response and Reporting
  > Incident Recognition and Identification > Anomalous Behavior Detection). Use the provided research context (completed/expanded):
  Core concepts (anomaly detection as identifying deviations from normal; normal behavior baselines; anomalies as threats
  like APTs/insider; FP/FN risks). Methodologies: Threshold-based (fixed/dynamic thresholds, cons: rigid, FP-prone); Statistical
  (z-scores, distributions); ML-based (unsupervised clustering/isolation forest); UEBA (behavioral baselines). Tools: SIEM/UEBA.
  Signature-based is complementary, NOT anomaly detection.
