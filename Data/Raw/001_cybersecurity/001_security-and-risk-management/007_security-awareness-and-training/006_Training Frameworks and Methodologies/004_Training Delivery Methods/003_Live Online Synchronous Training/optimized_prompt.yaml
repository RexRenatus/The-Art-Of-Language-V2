active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the impact of live online synchronous training on building a security culture
    in remote workforces amid evolving threats like ransomware. Support arguments with NIST SP 800-50 references and real-world
    examples, aiming for consensus on 3 key benefits.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
