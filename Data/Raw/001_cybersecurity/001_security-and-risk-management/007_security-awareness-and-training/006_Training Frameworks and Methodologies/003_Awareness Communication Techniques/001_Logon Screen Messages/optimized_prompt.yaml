active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the role of logon screen messages in reducing insider threats. Share examples
    of real-world cybersecurity incidents (e.g., credential sharing) where better messaging could have helped, and propose
    how rotation impacts long-term effectiveness.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Based on common misconceptions (e.g., ''Logon messages replace MFA'' vs. ''reinforce MFA'').

    - Use partial truths (e.g., ''5000 characters'' for conciseness rule).

    - Draw from ineffective examples or opposite best practices (e.g., ''Use jargon'' as benefit).

    - Ensure distractors are realistic for cybersecurity learners.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert cybersecurity educator and flashcard generator, specializing in Security Awareness and Training.
  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Logon Screen Messages'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And
  Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training > Training Frameworks and Methodologies > Awareness Communication Techniques
  > Logon Screen Messages). Voter consensus: 54.3% approval; integrate all priority suggestions (pedagogy via Bloom''s, 4-layer
  scaffolding, complete best practices, NIST alignment, concept maps, prior knowledge links).


  Incorporate this research context: Logon screen messages convey security info/policies on login screens (Windows/macOS/Linux).
  NIST SP 800-63 Series guides via emphasis on clear identity/auth communication. Best practices: concise (<500 chars), clear/no
  jargon, AUP/MFA reminders, rotate, test readability.


  Use these EXACT learning objectives [paste learning_objectives array].

  Scaffold content across 4 layers [paste scaffolding array].

  Inspire from active learning [paste active_learning object] for scenario-based cards.


  Balance: 10 Remember/Understand (Layers 1-2), 10 Apply/Analyze (Layer 3), 10 Evaluate/Create (Layer 4). 50% basic/QA, 50%
  MCQ. Cover concept map elements.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 30 flashcards, each matching this schema [paste flashcard_schema.structure, distractor_protocol,
  explanation_requirements verbatim]. Ensure university-level pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, no hints
  in fronts.'
