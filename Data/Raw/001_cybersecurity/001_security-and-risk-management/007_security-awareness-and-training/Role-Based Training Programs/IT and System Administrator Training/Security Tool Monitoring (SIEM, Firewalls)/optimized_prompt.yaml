active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''SIEM is more critical than firewalls for modern threat
    detection.'' Use examples of SIEM correlation vs. firewall prevention to support arguments, considering integration best
    practices and real-world limitations like false positives.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol:
    mcq_format: Always 4 options (1 correct, 3 distractors). Distractors must be plausible based on common misconceptions
      (e.g., confuse SIEM normalization with encryption; mix firewall types like claiming proxy firewalls do stateful inspection
      only). Draw from partial truths, outdated terms, or related but incorrect concepts (e.g., SIM vs. SIEM). Ensure no hints
      in wording.
    quantity: Generate MCQs for 40% of cards; others Q&A or cloze.
    variety: Balance across Bloom's levels and scaffolding layers.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert educational flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity training for IT and System
  Administrators. Topic: Security Tool Monitoring (SIEM, Firewalls). Context: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management
  > Security Awareness and Training > Role-Based Training Programs > IT and System Administrator Training > Security Tool
  Monitoring (SIEM, Firewalls). Voter consensus: 85.7% approval; incorporate completeness (full firewall types: network, host-based,
  NGFW, proxy, stateful; SIEM functions; best practices like tuning/logs/integration/pitfalls) and pedagogy (Bloom''s progression,
  4-layer scaffolding).


  Research grounding: SIEM aggregates/analyzes logs (collection, normalization, correlation, alerting, response); Firewalls
  filter traffic (logging, NAT, VPN); integrate for SOC efficacy.
