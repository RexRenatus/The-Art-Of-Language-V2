  discussion_prompt: In a company-wide phishing attack, how does individual accountability (per NIST definitions) help in
    identifying the breach source? Debate the balance between accountability (e.g., audit logs) and employee privacy, referencing
    ISO 27001 A.9.2 and real-world BYOD policies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Common misconception (e.g., ''focuses only on executives''), 3) Partial truth (e.g., omits non-repudiation). Base on
    real errors from breaches like Equifax or misread standards. Ensure plausible for cybersecurity learners.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-style pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on ''Individual Accountability Principles''

  **Research Context (Complete):** Individual accountability ensures individuals are identified and held responsible for actions
  in info systems (NIST: https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/individual_accountability). Core elements: identification, audit
  trails, non-repudiation. NIST CSF: Relies on traceability in Protect/Detect. NICE SP 800-181: Defines roles/tasks for accountability
  (e.g., Cybersecurity Analyst). ISO/IEC 27001: A.9.2 (access mgmt), A.12.4 (logging), mandates unique IDs/audits. Real-world:
  Equifax 2017 breach (insider access untraced). Related: RBAC, logging, insider threats, BYOD.


  **Sources:** NIST Glossary, NIST CSF (nist.gov/cyberframework), NIST SP 800-181 (NICE), ISO/IEC 27001:2022, Equifax Breach
  Report (FTC), NIST SP 800-53 (AC-2 Account Management).


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives from above].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers from above]. Prerequisites: Basic security hygiene.


  **Active Learning Ties:** Reference discussion (phishing/accountability-privacy), peer teaching (NIST explain/teach-back),
  problem-solving (Equifax analysis) in explanations.


  **Output 50 Flashcards using exact schema:**
