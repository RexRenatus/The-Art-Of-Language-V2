learning_objectives:
  analyze:
  - objective: Compare and contrast NIST SP 800-171 (protecting CUI) with NIST SP 800-53 (security controls catalog) and NIST
      SP 800-172 (enhanced supply chain protections).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  remember:
  - objective: Define key terms including Federal Contract Information (FCI), Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), Cybersecurity
      Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM), and System Security Plan (SSP).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  create:
  - objective: Develop a sample outline for a System Security Plan (SSP) tailored to a contractor handling CUI under CMMC
      Level 2.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  understand:
  - objective: Explain the purpose and structure of Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) levels and their alignment
      with NIST SP 800-171 controls for protecting FCI and CUI.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Identify specific security responsibilities of contractors (e.g., implementing NIST SP 800-171 controls, maintaining
      an SSP, achieving appropriate CMMC certification) in a given scenario involving handling CUI.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  evaluate:
  - objective: Assess a contractor's compliance with CMMC requirements based on a provided audit scenario or SSP excerpt.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss the implications of the SolarWinds supply chain attack on contractor security responsibilities.
    How could adherence to CMMC and NIST SP 800-171 have mitigated risks? What broader lessons apply to C-SCRM in third-party
    relationships? (Encourage critical thinking by debating trade-offs between compliance costs and security benefits.)
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    but incorrect term (e.g., classified vs. CUI), 3) partial truth (e.g., wrong CMMC level). Ensure distractors are web-grounded
    (e.g., from real NIST misreads) and avoid obvious errors. Use for 70% of cards (MCQ); others cloze/short answer.'
