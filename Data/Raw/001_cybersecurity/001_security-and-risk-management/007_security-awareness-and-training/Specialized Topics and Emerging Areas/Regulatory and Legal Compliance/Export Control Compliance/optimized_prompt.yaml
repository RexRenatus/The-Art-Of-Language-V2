  discussion_prompt: In a cybersecurity firm, an employee emails details of an encryption algorithm to a foreign national
    colleague working remotely in the U.S. Is this a 'deemed export' under EAR or ITAR? Debate the factors (e.g., nationality,
    technology classification), risks (fines, reputational damage), mitigation strategies (screening, licensing), and address
    common misconceptions like 'exports are only physical shipments.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Exports only
    physical'' vs. deemed), 2) Confusions (EAR dual-use vs. ITAR military), 3) Edge cases (OFAC sanctions vs. licensing),
    4) Partial truths (e.g., ''U.S. permanent residents are foreign entities'' - false). Ensure distractors are realistic
    from research/voter examples.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for university-level cybersecurity education on ''Export Control Compliance''
  (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training > Specialized Topics and Emerging
  Areas > Regulatory and Legal Compliance > Export Control Compliance). Use this optimized pedagogy:


  **Learning Objectives:** [insert the 6 objectives above]


  **Active Learning Integration:** Ensure flashcards test discussion/peer/problem-solving concepts (e.g., deemed export scenarios,
  EAR/ITAR classification, compliance steps).


  **Scaffolding:** Distribute cards evenly: 25% Layer 1 (Foundation: definitions, prior knowledge links to data classification),
  25% Layer 2 (Components: EAR/BIS/CCL, ITAR/DDTC/USML, OFAC/Treasury/SDN; flowcharts implied), 25% Layer 3 (Implementation:
  classify/screen/license/document/train steps), 25% Layer 4 (Integration: cyber risk mgmt, encryption exports, fines/reputation,
  compliance tools).


  **Content Sources:** Definitions (export/deemed/controlled from yale.edu); EAR (BIS dual-use, bis.doc.gov); ITAR (State
  DDTC defense, pmddtc.state.gov); OFAC (Treasury sanctions, home.treasury.gov/ofac). Examples: Encryption algos (EAR Cat
  5), vuln tools (dual-use), misconceptions (physical only). Big picture: Legal risks in global cyber ops.


  **Generate 50 high-quality flashcards** (varied types: 40% MCQ, 20% definition, 15% scenario classify, 10% true/false, 10%
  sequence/compare, 5% create prompts). Follow exact schema: [insert flashcard_schema structure]. Cover all Bloom''s levels/objectives
  evenly. Prioritize voter priorities: completeness (full EAR/ITAR/OFAC), pedagogy (progressive Bloom''s), practical examples.
  Output ONLY valid JSON array of 50 flashcards, no extra text.'
