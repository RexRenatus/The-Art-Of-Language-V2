active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, select and research one public recognition program (e.g., CRI Profile vs. UK Cyber Essentials),
    then teach the group its key criteria, benefits, and application process. Peers provide feedback using Bloom's evaluation
    criteria.
  problem_solving: For a fictional mid-sized financial firm, design custom recognition criteria inspired by NIST CSF and CRI
    Profile. Include a self-assessment checklist, potential challenges, and integration with existing phishing simulation
    metrics from security awareness training.

    - Partial truths (e.g., benefit that's overstated)
    - Irrelevant but similar terms (e.g., 'private certification' vs. public recognition)
