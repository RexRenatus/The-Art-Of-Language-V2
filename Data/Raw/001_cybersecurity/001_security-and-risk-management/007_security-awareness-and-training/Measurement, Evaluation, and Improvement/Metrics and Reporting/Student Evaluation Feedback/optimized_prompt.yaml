  > Security Awareness and Training > Measurement, Evaluation, and Improvement > Metrics and Reporting > Student Evaluation
  Feedback.


  **Topic Context (Topic Hierarchy):** Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training > Measurement,
  Evaluation, and Improvement > Metrics and Reporting > Student Evaluation Feedback. Key research: NIST SP 800-50 (awareness
  metrics), NIST CSF 2.0 (ID.RA risk assessment, PR.AT training; evaluate Current/Target Profiles). Metrics include pre/post
  assessments, knowledge retention, behavioral (phishing success), risk reduction linkage. Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (nist.gov/cyberframework),
  NIST SP 800-50 (csrc.nist.gov).


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s Taxonomy):** [Insert the full learning_objectives array here].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the full scaffolding_layers array here]. Ensure cards progress from Layer 1 to 4.


  **Active Learning Integration:** Tie explanations to components like [Insert abbreviated active_learning_components here,
  e.g., ''Debate ROI metrics''].


  **Generation Instructions:**

  - Create 25 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema: Front (question), Back (answer, explanation, distractors explained,
  scaffolding_reference, active_learning_hook).

  - Cover all objectives, layers, and voter priorities (completeness on NIST, specific metrics).

  - Use active recall: MCQs with distractors per protocol.

  - Explanations: University-level, web-grounded (cite NIST), scaffolded.

  - Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'':
  [...], ''scaffolding_reference'': ''...'', ''active_learning_hook'': ''...''}}].


  Voter Consensus: 67.1% approval; prioritize pedagogy and completeness.'
