active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges of quantifying 'Behavioral Change' in cybersecurity training
    ROI. Use NIST SP 800-55 examples to argue whether qualitative metrics (e.g., security culture surveys) are as valuable
    as quantitative ones (e.g., reduced phishing clicks). Synthesize consensus on a hybrid approach.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Misapplication (e.g., ROI = Benefits/Costs), 3) Context swap (e.g., finance ROI vs. cybersecurity). Ensure plausible
    for cybersecurity novices; avoid obvious wrongs.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, following university pedagogy (Bloom''s
  Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on ''Training ROI Measurement'' (Topic Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training > Measurement, Evaluation, and Improvement
  > Metrics and Reporting > Training ROI Measurement).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the 6 objectives above].

  - Active Learning: [reference activities for hooks in explanations].

  - Scaffolding: Cover all 4 layers progressively (10-15 cards per layer early, advanced later).

  - Prior Knowledge: Assume basic security awareness/metrics.

  - Key Content: NIST SP 800-50/55 (full: Vol1 metrics guide, Vol2 implementation supplements), Kirkpatrick (4 levels), Phillips
  ROI formula, behavioral change metrics, security culture, examples (ROI calc with incident reduction).

  - Big Picture: Data-driven SRM resilience.

  - Concept Map: As defined.


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards, each: {"front": "question", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...",
  "bloom_level": "...", "scaffolding_layer": "Layer X", "distractors": ["opt1", "opt2", "opt3"]}}.

  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: Active recall questions, MCQ with 3 distractors where apt, concise backs. Ensure spaced
  repetition: varied difficulty, no duplicates.'
