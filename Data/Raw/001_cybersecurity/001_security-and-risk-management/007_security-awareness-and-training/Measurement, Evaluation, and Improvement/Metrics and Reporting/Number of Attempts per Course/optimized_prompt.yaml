active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a security awareness training program, what is the optimal number of attempts allowed per course quiz?
    Debate the trade-offs between allowing unlimited retries (to promote learning) versus strict limits (to simulate real-world
    security constraints and prevent gaming the system). Support your position with references to ISO 27001 or CIS Controls.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: (1) Common misconception (e.g., equate to NIST auth throttling: ''100
    attempts per hour''); (2) Related but incorrect metric (e.g., ''quiz pass rate''); (3) Extreme/plausible wrong value (e.g.,
    ''unlimited attempts for learning''). Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter feedback (e.g., auth confusion)
    and web research pitfalls.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security Awareness and
  Training metrics. Topic: ''Number of Attempts per Course'' (hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security
  Awareness and Training > Measurement, Evaluation, and Improvement > Metrics and Reporting > Number of Attempts per Course).
  Focus strictly on training/quiz attempts in LMS (e.g., Moodle), NOT authentication rate-limiting—distinguish explicitly.
