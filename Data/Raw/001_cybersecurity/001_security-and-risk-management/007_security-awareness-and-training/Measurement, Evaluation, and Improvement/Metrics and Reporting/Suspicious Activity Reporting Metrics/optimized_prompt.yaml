active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In an organization facing high false positive rates in suspicious activity detection, debate whether
    increasing SAR filing volume improves security or burdens compliance. Propose 2-3 alternative metrics (e.g., SAR quality
    score, detection rate) and justify using FFIEC Appendix S or NIST SP 800-55 frameworks. Consider trade-offs and share
    real-world examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Research Context: SARs are reports to FinCEN for suspicious transactions (money laundering, fraud). Key metrics: SAR volume
  per period, % alerts to SARs, avg time to file, false positive rate, SAR quality score, regulatory feedback. Frameworks:
  FFIEC BSA/AML Appendix S (customer ID, transaction monitoring: https://bsaaml.ffiec.gov/manual/Appendices/20); NIST SP 800-55
  Rev. 1 (select measures, baselines, analyze/report: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-55r1.pdf);
  FinCEN SAR guidance (https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-regulations/guidance).
