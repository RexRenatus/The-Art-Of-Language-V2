active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of hiding SSIDs versus implementing WPA3 with visible SSIDs
    and strong PSKs. Consider usability, security effectiveness, and real-world attacks like Dragonblood. Support arguments
    with evidence from WPA standards and provide a consensus recommendation for a public venue.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    outdated fact (e.g., ''WEP is secure''), 1 related but wrong term (e.g., ''SAE'' vs ''PSK''). Ensure distractors are 70%
    plausible to challenge but not trick; explain in ''explanation'' why each is wrong.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 75 high-quality flashcards on
  ''WiFi Security Configuration'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Awareness and
  Training > Security Controls and Best Practices > Network and Communications Security > WiFi Security Configuration). Cover
  all elements below using university pedagogy (Bloom''s Taxonomy progression), active learning ties, 4-layer scaffolding,
  voter consensus (WPA3/SAE/PMF details, best practices: disable WPS/strong PSK/VLANs/firmware; vulns: KRACK/Dragonblood),
  and web research (WLAN/AP/STA/SSID/RSN/RSNA, WPA2 AES-CCMP PSK/Enterprise, WPA3 SAE/PMF/192-bit).


  **Learning Objectives (span all):** [Insert full list above]. Ensure 15 cards per Bloom''s level.


  **Active Learning Ties:** Infuse prompts referencing discussion (e.g., ''Debate SSID hiding''), peer teaching (e.g., ''Teach
  WPA2 vs WPA3''), problem-solving (coffee shop scenario).


  **Scaffolding Coverage:** 20% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 30% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4. Include prior knowledge hooks.


  **Output Format:** Array of JSON flashcards matching exact schema: {''type'': ''mcq|qa|cloze'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'':
  {''correct_answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [...]}, ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'':
  ''...'', ''tags'': [...]}. Strictly no other text.


  **Schema Rules:** [Insert full flashcard_schema above]. Make cards optimized for Anki/Quizlet: active recall, spaced repetition.
  Varied difficulty, no hints in front. Sources: IEEE 802.11, Wi-Fi Alliance, NIST, CIS Benchmarks.'
