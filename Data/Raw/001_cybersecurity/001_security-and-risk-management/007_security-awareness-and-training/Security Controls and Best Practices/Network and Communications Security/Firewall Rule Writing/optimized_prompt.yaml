active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a company with remote workers, debate whether outbound firewall rules should block all non-essential
    traffic (strict least privilege) or allow flexibility for productivity. Cite real-world risks (e.g., data exfiltration
    via malware) and benefits (e.g., user satisfaction), comparing strict vs. permissive policies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on
  ''Firewall Rule Writing'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Controls and Best Practices > Network and Communications

  Core content from research: Firewall rules control inbound (external to internal threats) vs. outbound (data exfiltration)
  traffic; least privilege (minimal permissions); block-by-default (deny all unless permitted); NIST SP 800-41 (specific rules,
  deny-by-default, auditing, optimization). Sources: esecurityplanet.com/networks/firewall-rules, docs.rackspace.com/docs/best-practices-for-firewall-rules-configuration.


  Prior knowledge: IP addresses, ports, protocols. Concept map: Central ''Firewall Rules'' → Inbound/Outbound, Parameters
  (IP/Port/Protocol), Principles (Least Privilege, Deny-All).
