active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of using VLANs versus physical network segmentation for
    limiting lateral movement in a corporate environment. Consider factors like cost, scalability, and security risks, referencing
    real-world breaches like the Target PCI DSS incident.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    traffic''); 2) Partial truths (e.g., ''Trunk ports only for access VLANs''); 3) Confusable terms (e.g., VLAN vs VTP);
    4) Edge cases (e.g., native VLAN as secure by default - false). Ensure one distractor is highly plausible.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on\
  \ 'Network Segmentation (VLANs)' in the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Controls\
  \ and Best Practices > Network and Communications Security > Network Segmentation (VLANs). Use the provided research context,\
  \ complete PCI DSS Requirement 1 explanation (isolate cardholder data environment (CDE) from other networks via VLANs/firewalls,\
  \ limit inbound/outbound traffic), and sources like IEEE 802.1Q, PCI DSS v4.0 (https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/), Cisco\
  \ VLAN Config Guide (https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst9300/software/release/17-3/configuration_guide/vlans/b_173_vlans_9300_cg.html).\n\
  \nIncorporate these pedagogical elements:\n- Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]\n- Active Learning: Tie explanations\
  \ to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving where relevant.\n- Scaffolding: [insert full 4 layers above]. Prioritize coverage\
  \ across layers.\n- Concept Map: Use in foundational cards.\n\nFollow this exact output format for each flashcard as JSON\
  \ objects in an array:\n{\n  \"card_id\": 1,\n  \"type\": \"MCQ\",\n  \"front\": \"Question?\",\n  \"back\": \"**Answer**\"\

  \ pedagogy (objectives/activities/scaffolding), accuracy (correct subdomain)."
