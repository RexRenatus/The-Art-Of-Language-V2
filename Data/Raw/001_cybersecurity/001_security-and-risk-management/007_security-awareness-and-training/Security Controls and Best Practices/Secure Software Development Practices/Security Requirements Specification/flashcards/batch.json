      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Integrating security into the SDLC is crucial because building security in from the start is more effective and less costly than retrofitting it later, since vulnerabilities introduced early are harder and more expensive to fix, because it works by embedding security activities and requirements into each phase of development. This connects secure development practices to the overall system lifecycle (NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5, SA-3).",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly mandate specific methodologies, limit security to testing, or promise bug-free development, missing the core principle of proactive, lifecycle-wide security integration.",
        "analogy": "Integrating security into the SDLC is like building safety features into a car during its design and manufacturing, rather than trying to add them after the car is already built."
