  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: 'Teach-back activity: One learner explains the PIN lifecycle (creation, conveyance, usage, destruction) and
    secrecy protections per PCI standards to a partner, who then summarizes key points and quizzes the teacher on NIST AAL
    relevance. Switch roles to build explanation and retention skills.'
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A retailer''s POS terminal exposes PINs during processing due to insecure key management. Diagnose
    breach points (e.g., shoulder-surfing, weak cryptography), propose compliant fixes using PCI PIN Security Standard steps,
    and role-play as a Qualified PIN Assessor (QPA) auditing the system.'

    crypto keys'' from poor key mgmt; ''PIN secrecy ignores lifecycle'' from incomplete standards knowledge; ''NIST AAL1 suffices
    for all payments'' vs. PCI requirements). Ensure distractors are realistic, derived from research context or voter-noted
    errors like shoulder-surfing neglect.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on
  ''PIN Secrecy'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training > Security
  Controls and Best Practices > Authentication and Access Control > PIN Secrecy). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy
  (balance levels per objectives), active learning integration, 4-layer scaffolding.


  **Sources (mandatory references):** PCI PIN Security Standard (pcisecuritystandards.org/standards/pin_security); NIST SP
  800-63B (Digital Identity Guidelines, AALs); PCI SSC Qualified PIN Assessors (QPAs).

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers above]. Distribute flashcards: 30% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 20% Layer
  4.


  **Active Learning Integration:** Embed hints/links to: [Insert the 3 activities above].


  **Flashcard Generation Rules:**

  - 40% Cloze deletions for recall.

  - 40% MCQ with 4 options (1 correct, 3 distractors per protocol).

  - 20% Short answer/application for higher Bloom''s.

  - Balance Bloom''s: 2 Remember, 2 Understand, 1 Apply, 1 Analyze, 1 Evaluate, 1 Create per 10 cards.

  - Ensure completeness: Cover lifecycle steps, NIST AALs (AAL1 single-factor PIN; AAL2/3 MFA), prior knowledge (passwords),
  big picture (fraud losses).

  - Follow exact schema: [Insert flashcard_schema structure above].
