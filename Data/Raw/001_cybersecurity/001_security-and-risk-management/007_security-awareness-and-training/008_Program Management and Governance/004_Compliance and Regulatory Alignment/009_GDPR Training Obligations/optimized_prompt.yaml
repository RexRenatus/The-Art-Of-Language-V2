  discussion_prompt: 'In groups, debate the statement: ''GDPR training should be mandatory for all staff equally, regardless
    of role.'' Use evidence from Articles 29 and 39, risk assessments, and real-world fine examples (e.g., 4% global revenue
    penalties) to support your position, considering both all-staff and role-specific needs.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1 based on common misconception (e.g., ''GDPR mandates annual
    training'' vs. implicit); 1 from related but incorrect concept (e.g., confuse controller/processor); 1 extreme/overly
    specific (e.g., wrong Article number). Ensure distractors are realistic from voter/research context (e.g., incomplete
    topics like missing breach reporting).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, optimized for Bloom''s Taxonomy,
  active learning, and spaced repetition. Generate exactly 30 high-quality flashcards on ''GDPR Training Obligations'' (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training > Program Management and Governance
  > Compliance and Regulatory Alignment > GDPR Training Obligations).
