  discussion_prompt: 'Evaluate the Equifax data breach (2017): Identify legal and contractual failures (e.g., inadequate PII
    protection under state laws), and discuss how NIST CSF 2.0''s Govern and Protect functions could have prevented or mitigated
    it. What contractual clauses (e.g., SLAs) should have been in place?'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
