  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the integration of cybersecurity program administration with Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
    using the NIST CSF GOVERN function. Compare Tier 1 (Partial: governance is ad hoc) vs. Tier 4 (Adaptive: dynamic and proactive)
    implementations for a startup versus a large enterprise. Address common misconceptions, such as governance being merely
    bureaucratic rather than strategic.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Program Administration
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training > Program Management and
  Governance > Program Lifecycle Management > Program Administration). Use the provided Learning Objectives, Active Learning
  components, 4-Layer Scaffolding, and Flashcard Schema to create 50 high-quality flashcards.


  Incorporate full content from Scaffolding Layers, including NIST CSF 2.0 (GOVERN focus), NIST SP 800-53 PM Controls (PM-1
  to PM-15 as listed), ERM integration, prior knowledge links, related concepts, and sources.


  Align flashcards to Bloom''s progression: 10 REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 20 APPLY/ANALYZE, 20 EVALUATE/CREATE. Embed active learning:
  10% reference discussion/peer teaching/problems.


  Output ONLY in JSON array of flashcards, each as: {''type'': ''MCQ|Basic|Cloze|Application'', ''bloom_level'': ''REMEMBER|etc.'',
