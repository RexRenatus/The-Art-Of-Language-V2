  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Information Security Policies should prioritize technical
    controls over business alignment.'' Use examples from NIST CSF 2.0 and real-world breaches (e.g., Equifax) to argue for
    or against, encouraging critical thinking on misconceptions like confusing policy with procedures.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truths (e.g., NIST CSF Identify only, ignoring Govern); 3) Real-world pitfalls (e.g., overemphasizing tech
    without business alignment); 4) Voter-noted gaps (e.g., truncated NIST info). Ensure plausible for intermediate learners,
    avoiding obvious errors.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in CISSP-aligned topics. Generate
  25 high-quality flashcards for ''Information Security Policy Alignment'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And
  Risk Management > Security Awareness and Training > Program Management and Governance > Policy and Standards Integration
  > Information Security Policy Alignment).


  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Content Sources**: NIST CSF 2.0 (Govern function), NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (20 control families, tailoring), ISO/IEC 27001
  (ISMS, Annex A), COBIT (APO13). Core concepts: Policy definitions, ERM integration, risk governance. Examples/misconceptions
  as per scaffolding.

  - **Learning Objectives**: Use these Bloom''s-spanning objectives [insert full list from above].

  - **Scaffolding**: Distribute cards across 4 layers [insert full scaffolding from above].

  - **Active Learning Ties**: Include hints referencing discussion/activities for higher-level cards.

  - **Big Picture**: Emphasize bridging governance-ops for domain mastery.

  - **Prior Knowledge**: Link to basics like risk fundamentals.


  **Output Format**: JSON array of objects, each: {''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'',
  ''explanation'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'', ''opt3'']}, ''tags'': [...]}.
  Follow flashcard_schema exactly. Ensure factual accuracy, measurable verbs, and distractor protocol. Vary question types
  for engagement.'
