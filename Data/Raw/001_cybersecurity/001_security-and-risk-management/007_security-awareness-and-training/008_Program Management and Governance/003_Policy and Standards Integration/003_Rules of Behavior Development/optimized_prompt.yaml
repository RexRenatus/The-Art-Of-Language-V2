    or allow it with mitigations? Argue positions using NIST CSF 2.0 Govern function, NIST SP 800-53 PL-4 enforcement requirements,
    and real-world risks like data leakage. Divide into pro/con teams and vote on the best policy.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
