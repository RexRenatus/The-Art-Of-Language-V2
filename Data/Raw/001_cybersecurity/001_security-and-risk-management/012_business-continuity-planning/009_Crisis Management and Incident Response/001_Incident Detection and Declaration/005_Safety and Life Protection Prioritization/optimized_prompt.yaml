active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a ransomware attack on a hospital's life-support systems, debate the trade-offs between restoring
    data access quickly versus ensuring patient safety first. How does Safety and Life Protection Prioritization guide decisions,
    and what ethical dilemmas arise? Support your arguments with references to NIST CSF or ERM.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert educational flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity pedagogy. Generate 25 high-quality\
  \ flashcards for the topic 'Safety and Life Protection Prioritization' (Category: Cybersecurity, Domain: Security And Risk\
  \ Management, Subdomain: Business Continuity Planning, Entry Domain: Crisis Management and Incident Response, Entry Subdomain:\
  \ Incident Detection and Declaration). Topic Hierarchy: Level 1: Cybersecurity > Level 2: Security And Risk Management >\
  \ Level 3: Business Continuity Planning > Level 4: Crisis Management and Incident Response > Level 5: Incident Detection\
  \ and Declaration > Level 6: Safety and Life Protection Prioritization.\n\nIncorporate these learning objectives (span Bloom's\
  \ Taxonomy):\n1. Remember: Recall key terms (Safety and Life Protection Prioritization, Critical Infrastructure, Cybersecurity\
  \ Risk Management, ERM).\n2. Understand: Explain elevation of human life in decisions.\n3. Apply: Prioritize in scenarios.\n\
  4. Analyze: Break down NIST CSF 2.0 components.\n5. Evaluate: Assess BCP effectiveness.\n6. Create: Design prioritization\
  \ matrices.\n\nDistribute flashcards across scaffolding layers:\n- Layer 1 Foundation (5 cards: basics).\n- Layer 2 Components\
