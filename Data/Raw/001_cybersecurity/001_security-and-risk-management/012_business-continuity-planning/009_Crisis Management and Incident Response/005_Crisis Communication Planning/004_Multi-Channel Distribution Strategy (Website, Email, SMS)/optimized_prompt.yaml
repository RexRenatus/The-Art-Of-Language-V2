active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages and disadvantages of relying solely on SMS for urgent cybersecurity
    alerts versus a balanced multi-channel approach (Website, Email, SMS). Consider factors like reach, security risks, user
    accessibility, and alignment with NIST CSF principles. Support your arguments with real-world examples from crisis management.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving prompts as contextual examples in explanations.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers (Foundation: 25%, Components: 25%, Implementation: 25%, Integration:
  25%).

  - Ensure Bloom''s coverage: Remember/Understand (Layer 1), Apply/Analyze (Layers 2-3), Evaluate/Create (Layer 4).


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards following this exact schema:
