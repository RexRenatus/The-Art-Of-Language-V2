  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Network slicing in 5G fully eliminates hybrid threats
    to telecommunications resilience.'' Use examples from ENISA threat landscapes and 3GPP standards to support your position,
    considering impacts on CIA triad elements.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: (1) Common misconception (e.g., ''5G eliminates all latency''
    vs. resilience focus); (2) Related but incorrect term (e.g., ''4G slicing'' vs. 5G); (3) Partial truth exaggerated (e.g.,
    ''NIST only for privacy'' vs. cybersecurity). Ensure distractors test subtle understanding.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 30 high-quality flashcards (10
  Basic Q&A, 10 MCQ, 10 Application Scenario) on ''5G and Advanced Telecommunications Resilience'' using the provided structure.
  Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security & Risk Management > Business Continuity Planning > Technology/Automation > Emerging
  Technologies > 5G Resilience. Incorporate these exact elements:


  **Learning Objectives:** [paste the full array above]


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [paste full scaffolding JSON above] – Distribute flashcards across layers (8 Layer 1, 7 Layer 2,
  8 Layer 3, 7 Layer 4).


  **Active Learning:** Embed prompts in explanations (e.g., ''Apply in problem-solving exercise'').


  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly follow [paste full schema above]. Balance Bloom''s levels (5 per level). Use research context:
  Core concepts (5G, Resilience, Hybrid Threats, Network Slicing, Attack Surface); Standards (NIST 5G Cybersecurity/PRIV,
  GSMA NG.133, 3GPP SA3, ETSI slicing security, ENISA threats).


  Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''1'', ''blooms_level'': ''REMEMBER'',
  ''explanation'': ''...''}]. Ensure flashcards promote active recall, spaced repetition, and deep understanding for business
  continuity in emerging tech.'
