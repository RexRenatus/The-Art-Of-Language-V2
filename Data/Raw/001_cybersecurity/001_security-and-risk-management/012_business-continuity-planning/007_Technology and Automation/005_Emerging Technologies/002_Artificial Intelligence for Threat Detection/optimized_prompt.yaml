    pose? Consider real-world cases like the SolarWinds breach and discuss mitigation strategies in a think-pair-share format.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Non-example/confusion with related term (e.g., ML vs. DL), 3) Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''AI only for
    known threats''). Ensure plausibility based on research context; explanations must clarify and reference scaffolding.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 50-100 high-quality, spaced-repetition

  Intelligence for Threat Detection.


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list from above]

  - Active Learning: Embed ties to [discussion_prompt], [peer_teaching_activity], [problem_solving_exercise].

  - Scaffolding: Distribute across 4 layers [insert summaries from scaffolding_layers].

  - Balance Bloom''s levels: 20% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate, 20% Create.


  Content foundation (web-grounded, voter-completed):

  - Definitions: [Layer 1 content]

  - Enhancements: Pattern Recognition (network traffic/logs analysis), Anomaly Detection, Predictive Analytics, NLP (phishing
  emails, log parsing, threat summarization), Generative AI (attack simulations), LLMs (intel analysis, code review).

  - Implementation: Data collection/training/deployment.

  - Integration: BCP hybrid systems, concept map as described.

  - Examples: SolarWinds, zero-day attacks.

  - Misconceptions: AI infallible, ignores false positives/adversarial risks.


  Output EXACTLY in flashcard_schema format: JSON array of objects with ''front'' and ''back'' (including answer, exactly
  3 distractors with explanations, bloom_level, scaffolding_layer, topic_hierarchy, active_learning_link). Ensure distractors
  follow protocol. Make questions active recall (cloze, MCQ). No extra text.'
