active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of fully automated self-healing versus human-in-the-loop oversight. Consider scenarios
    where over-reliance on automation could fail (e.g., novel zero-day attacks) and how it aligns with NIST CSF Govern function.
    Share real-world examples from breaches like SolarWinds.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    all human roles''), 2) Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Only for recovery, not detection''), 3) Confusable term
    (e.g., mix SIEM with SOAR). Ensure distractors test nuance without being obvious.'
