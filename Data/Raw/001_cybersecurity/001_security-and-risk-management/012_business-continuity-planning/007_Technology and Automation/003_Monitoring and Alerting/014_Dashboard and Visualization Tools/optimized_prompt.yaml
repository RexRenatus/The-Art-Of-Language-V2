active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains a NIST CSF Detect function visualization example using Kibana (e.g., anomaly
    detection heatmap), while the partner recreates it verbally, identifies potential flaws, and quizzes the explainer on
    tool alternatives like Splunk.
  problem_solving: Given sample security log data (e.g., JSON snippet with timestamps, IP anomalies, alert severities), students
    build a prototype dashboard in Grafana or a free tool to identify business continuity risks (e.g., DDoS impacting critical
    systems), then present optimizations for real-time alerting.

    truth (e.g., wrong framework like ''PCI DSS Detect''), 3) Tool confusion (e.g., attribute Kibana features to Tableau).
    Ensure plausibility from voter-noted gaps (e.g., HITRUST truncation, tool examples). Balance difficulty: 70% Layer 1-2,
    30% Layer 3-4.'

  **Content Foundation (Scaffolding Layers):**

  - Layer 1 Foundation: [insert layer1_foundation text]

  - Layer 2 Components: [insert layer2_components text]

  - Layer 3 Implementation: [insert layer3_implementation text]

  - Layer 4 Integration: [insert layer4_integration text]


  **Research Context:** Dashboards centralize security KPIs (threats, risks) for SOC/BCP. Tools: Splunk (SIEM queries), Kibana
  (ELK visualizations), Grafana (metrics). NIST CSF 2.0: Govern/Detect/Respond/Recover. HITRUST CSF: Controls 09.ac (monitoring),
  12 (BCP). Reduces MTTR, mitigates biases.


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s):** [insert full objectives array as numbered list].


  **Active Learning Inspiration:** Use for scenario cards: [insert discussion], [peer_teaching], [problem_solving].


  **Flashcard Generation:** Create exactly 40 flashcards following this schema:

  {flashcard_id: number, front: question, back: {answer: string, explanation: string, bloom_level: string, scaffolding_layer:
  string, active_learning_tie: string or null, source_reference: string}}. Output ONLY a JSON array of these objects. Ensure
  variety (MCQ 50%, cloze 20%, short answer 15%, scenario 15%). Distractors: Strictly follow protocol - plausible, tied to
  misconceptions/frameworks/tools. Progressive: 10 cards/Layer 1-2, 10/Layer 3, 20/Layer 4. Optimize for active recall, university
  pedagogy.'
