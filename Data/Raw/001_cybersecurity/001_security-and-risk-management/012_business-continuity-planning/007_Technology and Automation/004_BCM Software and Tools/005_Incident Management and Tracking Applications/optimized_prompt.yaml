active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare NIST SP 800-61r3 incident phases with the SANS Institute model. In a simulated data breach at
    a financial firm, debate which framework better supports rapid containment versus thorough post-incident analysis. Address
    the misconception that all security events are incidents.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, explain the differences between 'security event' (e.g., login failure), 'incident' (e.g., unauthorized
    access), and 'data breach' (e.g., exfiltrated data) using real and non-examples. Then, teach-back to the group and map
    to tools like Splunk for logging events.
  problem_solving: In groups, design an incident tracking workflow for a ransomware scenario using a free tool like Trello
    or Jira. Apply NIST steps from detection to recovery, map to business continuity plans, and present optimizations like
    collaboration features and reporting.

    rules:
    - Use common misconceptions (e.g., 'All events are incidents' as distractor)
    - Similar terms/concepts (e.g., 'Security event' vs. 'Incident')
    - Partial truths (e.g., NIST phase names mixed up)
    - Real-world tool confusions (e.g., Splunk as 'only logging' vs. full IRM)
    - Plausible but incorrect frameworks (e.g., ISO 22301 phase as NIST)
    count: 3 distractors per MCQ, balanced difficulty
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Incident Management and
  Tracking Applications'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Business Continuity Planning > Technology
