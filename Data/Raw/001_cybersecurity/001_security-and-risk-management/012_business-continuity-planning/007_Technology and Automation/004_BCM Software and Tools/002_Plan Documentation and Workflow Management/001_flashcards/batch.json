      "distractors": [
        {
          "text": "Continuous monitoring replaces the need for any formal plan documentation.",
          "misconception": "Targets [replacement fallacy]: Assumes monitoring negates the need for documented plans."

        {
          "text": "Plan documentation is only relevant before continuous monitoring begins.",

        {
          "text": "Continuous monitoring focuses on technical vulnerabilities, not plan documentation.",

      ],
      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Continuous monitoring provides real-time data on control effectiveness, therefore informing necessary adjustments to security and privacy plans, because it creates a feedback loop that ensures documentation reflects the current risk posture and operational reality, functioning as an ongoing validation process.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly suggest monitoring replaces documentation, is only relevant pre-monitoring, or ignores plans, failing to grasp the symbiotic relationship where monitoring data drives plan updates.",
        "analogy": "Continuous monitoring is like a doctor regularly checking a patient's vital signs; the data gathered helps update the treatment plan (documentation) to ensure it remains effective for the patient's health."
