  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (70% of cards): Generate 3 plausible distractors per card. Ensure: 1) common misconception
    (e.g., confuse BCP with DR), 2) related but incorrect term/feature (e.g., ''mass notifications'' as Resolver''s strength
    vs. Everbridge), 3) overstated/understated option (e.g., ''eliminates all risks'' vs. ''mitigates''). Distractors from
    lower Bloom''s layers; correct answer most precise/complete. Balance 4 options (A-D).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert educational flashcard generator specializing in university-level cybersecurity topics, using
  Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, and scaffolding for optimal retention. Generate flashcards for the topic: **Business
  Continuity Management Software Platforms** (Category: Cybersecurity; Domain: Security And Risk Management; Subdomain: Business
  Continuity Planning; Entry Domain: Technology and Automation; Entry Subdomain: BCM Software and Tools). Full Hierarchy:
  Level 1: Cybersecurity > Level 2: Security And Risk Management > Level 3: Business Continuity Planning > Level 4: Technology
  and Automation > Level 5: BCM Software and Tools > Level 6: Business Continuity Management Software Platforms.


  **Research Context (Web-Grounded, Completed):** BCM software enables planning/response/recovery from disruptions, emphasizing
  cybersecurity. Key definitions: BCM (resilience framework, zscaler.com), Cybersecurity (protect systems, cisa.gov), BCP
  (disaster procedures), DR (IT recovery), Resilience (adapt/recover), Zero Trust (never trust, always verify). Standards:
  ISO 27001 (ISMS with BCM in A.17: plans, testing); ISO 27002 (guidance: redundancy, availability). NIST CSF (Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover).
  Platforms: Everbridge (notifications, events); Fusion Framework (planning, testing); Resolver (risk/incident); LogicGate
  (GRC); ServiceNow BCM (ITSM integration). Features: risk assessment, simulations, Zero Trust APIs. Case studies: Everbridge
  in disasters.


  **Prior Knowledge:** Assumes basics in threats/risk assessment (Security/Risk Mgmt) and BCP fundamentals.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the full learning_objectives array from above].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the full scaffolding array from above]. Ensure 6-8 cards per layer, progressing from low
  to high Bloom''s.


  **Active Learning Integration:** Inspire cards with discussion (Zero Trust/NIST), peer teaching (platform features), problem-solving
  (scenarios). E.g., cards prompting ''Debate/Apply in scenario.''


  **Voter Consensus:** 67.1% approval; prioritize platforms, standards completion, Bloom''s coverage.


  **Generation Instructions:** Create EXACTLY 25-30 flashcards covering all 6 Bloom''s levels (4-5 each), all 4 layers, 70%
  MCQ/30% ShortAnswer. Balance: 30% foundation terms, 25% standards/features, 25% platforms, 20% integration/eval. Use schema
  below. Output ONLY a valid JSON array of flashcard objects. No extra text.
