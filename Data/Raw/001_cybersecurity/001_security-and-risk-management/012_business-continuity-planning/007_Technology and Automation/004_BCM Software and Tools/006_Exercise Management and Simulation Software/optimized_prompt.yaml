active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages and limitations of commercial exercise management software
    (e.g., Everbridge vs. Resolver) versus open-source tools for simulating cyber incidents in a BCP context. How does AI
    integration address common gaps in traditional exercises? Support with NIST SP 800-84 references.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Core Content (Complete and Authoritative):** Exercise management software supports TT&E programs (NIST SP 800-84: Guide
  to Test, Training, Exercise Programs for IT Plans/Capabilities). TT&E prepares for disruptions: Tests (verify plans/systems),
  Training (build skills), Exercises (simulate events). NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2 (Risk Management Framework): Integrates TT&E
  into Prepare step for risk-informed continuity. Software examples: Resolver (risk/exercise mgmt), Everbridge (crisis simulation),
  Fusion Framework (continuity exercises). Modules: Design tools, simulation engines (AI-driven), analytics. Sources: [NIST
  SP 800-84](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-84.pdf), [NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SP/800/37r2.pdf),
