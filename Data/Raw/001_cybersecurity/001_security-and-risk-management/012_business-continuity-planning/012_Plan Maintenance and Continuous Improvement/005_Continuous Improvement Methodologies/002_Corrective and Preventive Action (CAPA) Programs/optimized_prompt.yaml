active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In resource-limited organizations, should cybersecurity teams prioritize preventive or corrective CAPA
    actions post-incident? Debate the trade-offs using NIST CSF functions (e.g., Respond vs. Protect) and real-world examples
    like the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack, considering impacts on business continuity.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (40% of cards): Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse
    corrective as proactive; mix with incident response steps; oversimplify RCA as symptom fixing). Ensure 1 correct, distractors
    are realistic errors from research/voter formative examples. Label correct answer clearly.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)²-aligned topics.
  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on ''Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) Programs'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > Security And Risk Management > Business Continuity Planning > Plan Maintenance and Continuous Improvement > Continuous
  Improvement Methodologies > CAPA Programs).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert the full array from ''learning_objectives'' above]. Cover all Bloom''s levels evenly (4-5
  cards per level).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [insert descriptions from ''scaffolding_layers'']. 5-7 cards per layer,
  progressing from simple recall to complex integration.

  - Active Learning: Infuse elements like discussion trade-offs (preventive vs. corrective), peer teaching (5 Whys/Fishbone),
  problem-solving scenarios (web app leak) into scenario/MCQ prompts.

  - Research Context: Use definitions (nonconformity, corrective/preventive action, RCA via 5 Whys/Fishbone), standards (ISO
  27001 Cl. 10.1, NIST CSF functions), cybersecurity examples (patching vulnerabilities, post-breach training). Emphasize
  BCP evolution to proactive resilience.

  - Prior Knowledge: Link to incident response, risk assessment, PDCA.


  Follow this Flashcard Schema exactly [insert full ''flashcard_schema'' above]. Mix types: 40% MCQ, 30% definition/short
  answer, 30% scenario/application. Ensure cybersecurity focus, no medical device bias. Optimize for Anki/spaced repetition:
  active recall, concise fronts, rich backs. Output ONLY a valid JSON array of 25 flashcards.'
