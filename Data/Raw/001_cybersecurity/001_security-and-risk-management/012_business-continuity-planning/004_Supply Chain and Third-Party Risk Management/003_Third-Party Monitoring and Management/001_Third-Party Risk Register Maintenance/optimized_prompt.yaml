active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Using NIST SP 800-161 and FSB guidelines, debate whether TPRR maintenance should be quarterly or event-driven.
    What are the pros, cons, and real-world examples like the SolarWinds hack? Consider trade-offs in resource allocation,
    risk coverage, and regulatory compliance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Annual reviews only'' vs.
    ''Quarterly for high-risk''); 2) Partial truth (e.g., ''Vendor name only'' vs. full components); 3) Extreme/opposite (e.g.,
    ''No updates needed'' vs. ''Event-driven''). Ensure distractors test nuance from research context.'

  **Research Context (Complete Summary):**

  Maintaining a robust Third-Party Risk Register (TPRR) is critical for TPRM and C-SCRM. TPRR: Dynamic inventory of third-parties,
  risks, criticality. TPRM: Identify/assess/mitigate vendor risks. C-SCRM: Manage supply chain cyber risks (NIST). Critical
  Service: Disruption-impacting service (FSB). Nth-party: Subcontractors in third-party chains (FSB).


  **FSB Toolkit Best Practices:** Regular updates (high-risk quarterly/event-driven); Data fields: Vendor Name, Services,
  Risk Scores (inherent/residual), Controls, Due Diligence, Contract Expiry, Criticality, Incidents. Processes: Onboarding,
  reviews, logging, automation. Integrate with NIST SP 800-161 (C-SCRM), BCP, incident response. Examples: SolarWinds (nth-party
  breach).


  **Sources:** FSB Toolkit (fsb.org/2023/10), NIST SP 800-161r1 (csrc.nist.gov), BlueVoyant TPRM resources.
