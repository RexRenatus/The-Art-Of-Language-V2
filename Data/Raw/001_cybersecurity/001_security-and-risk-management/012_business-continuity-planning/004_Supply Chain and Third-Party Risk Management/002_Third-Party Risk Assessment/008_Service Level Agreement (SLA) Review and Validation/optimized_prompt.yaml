active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the impact of poorly defined SLAs on supply chain cybersecurity risks.
    How do metrics like TTD and TTR influence business continuity? Provide real-world examples from recent breaches (e.g.,
    SolarWinds) and propose improvements.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - 'Distractor 2: Confused similar term (e.g., SLO as KPI synonym).'
  - 'Distractor 3: Extreme/plausible but incorrect value (e.g., TTD benchmark as 24 hours instead of <1 hour).'
  - Ensure distractors are web-grounded (e.g., from real SLA pitfalls) and teach why wrong in explanation.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university pedagogy (Bloom''s
  Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality flashcards for ''Service Level Agreement (SLA) Review and
  Validation'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Business Continuity Planning > Supply Chain
  and Third-Party Risk Management > Third-Party Risk Assessment > SLA Review and Validation).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the array above].

  - Active Learning: Use elements in explanations (e.g., ''Links to peer-teaching on TTD'').

  - Scaffolding: [paste the 4 layers above] – tag each card.

  - Research Context: Core concepts (SLA, SLOs, KPIs, TTD, TTR, TTRv, False Positive Rate); NIST (CSF, SP 800-53 Rev5: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final,
