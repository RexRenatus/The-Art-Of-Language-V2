  ## Regulatory Compliance Verification in Cybersecurity

  Process to demonstrate adherence to legal/regulatory/industry standards for data protection/security controls. Critical
  for risk mitigation, penalties avoidance, trust, markets.


  ### Core Concepts

  - Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to laws/standards (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, NYDFS).

  - Cybersecurity Framework: Standards/guidelines for risk management (e.g., NIST CSF).

  - Verification: Audits/assessments confirming controls meet requirements.

  - Data Protection: CIA triad.

  Prior links: Extends Security/Risk Mgmt to third-party BCP alignment.


  ### Four Pillars

  1. Regulatory Compliance (gov''t rules).

  2. Industry Standards (NIST CSF: 5 Functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover), Categories/Subcategories, Organizational
  Profiles (current/target states), Implementation Tiers (1 Partial to 4 Adaptive), Profiles; ISO 27001: ISMS; PCI DSS: payments;
  HIPAA: health; GDPR: EU data).

  3. Audit-Driven (SOC 1/2/3 reports).

  4. Contractual/Third-Party (vendor questionnaires, right-to-audit clauses).


  ### Implementation

  Gap analysis, audits, verification (questionnaires, SOC reviews, audits).


  ### Integration

  Cross-mapping (NIST vs ISO), third-party BCP verification.
