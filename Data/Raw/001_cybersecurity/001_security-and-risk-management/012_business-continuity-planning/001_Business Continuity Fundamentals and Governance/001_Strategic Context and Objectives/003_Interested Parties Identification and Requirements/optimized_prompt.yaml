active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the potential consequences for business continuity if an organization overlooks
    requirements from external interested parties like regulators or customers during cybersecurity planning. Provide real-world
    examples and propose mitigation strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 distractors (B, C, D) that are plausible based on common errors: e.g., confusing internal/external
    stakeholders, misapplying NIST CSF elements, overlooking business continuity links, or using outdated definitions. Ensure
    distractors test nuance (e.g., legal vs. ethical requirements).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, aligned with university pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Topic: ''Interested Parties Identification and Requirements'' (Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Business Continuity Planning > Business Continuity Fundamentals and Governance
  > Strategic Context and Objectives > Interested Parties Identification and Requirements). Use research context: Interested
  parties are internal/external stakeholders (e.g., executives, customers, regulators); requirements from legal/contractual/expectations;
  NIST CSF 2.0 GV.OC emphasizes organizational context integration with ERM.
