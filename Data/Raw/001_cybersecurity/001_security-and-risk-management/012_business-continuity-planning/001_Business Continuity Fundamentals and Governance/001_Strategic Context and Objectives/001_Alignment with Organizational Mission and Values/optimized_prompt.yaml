  topic ''Alignment with Organizational Mission and Values''.


  **Topic Hierarchy for Context**:

  - Level 1: Cybersecurity

  - Level 2: Security And Risk Management

  - Level 3: Business Continuity Planning

  - Level 4: Business Continuity Fundamentals and Governance

  - Level 5: Strategic Context and Objectives

  - Level 6: Alignment with Organizational Mission and Values


  **Core Content from Research**:

  - Focus on NIST CSF 2.0 GOVERN (GV) function: Establishes cybersecurity risk strategy aligned with organizational context
  (mission, values, stakeholders, regulations).

  - Key terms: Organizational mission (purpose), values (ethical principles), ERM, BCP governance.

  - Emphasis: Integrate cybersecurity into strategic objectives to avoid hindering core purpose.


  **Learning Objectives** (cover evenly across flashcards):

  1. Remember: Define key terms...

  2. Understand: Explain importance...

  3. Apply: Demonstrate mapping...

  4. Analyze: Identify misalignments...

  5. Evaluate: Assess effectiveness...

  6. Create: Develop strategic plan...


  **Scaffolding Layers** (6 flashcards each):

  1. Foundation: Basic terms...

  2. Components: NIST CSF GOVERN...

  3. Implementation: Practical steps...

  4. Integration: Advanced BCP/ERM connections...


  **Active Learning Integration**: Each back side includes a tie-in to one of: Discussion (''Debate misalignment risks...''),
  Peer Teaching (''Teach peers GV subcategories...''), Problem-Solving (''Scenario: Align for ransomware...'').


  **Output Format**: JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'', ''opt3''] (if MCQ, else null), ''active_learning_tie_in'': ''...''}}, ...]. Vary types:
  40% definitions, 30% MCQs, 20% application, 10% analysis/evaluation. Ensure spaced repetition potential with progressive
