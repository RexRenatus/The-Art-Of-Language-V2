active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges and benefits of integrating Annex L high-level structures
    (e.g., NIST CSF) into legacy Business Continuity Plans. Consider factors like organizational maturity (Tiers), resource
    constraints, and alignment with ERM. Support arguments with evidence from NIST guidelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Distractor 1: Common misconception from partial understanding (e.g., confuse Profiles with Tiers).'
    - 'Distractor 2: Plausible but incorrect alternative from related concepts (e.g., mix NIST functions with ISO 27001 controls).'
    - 'Distractor 3: Extreme or outdated view (e.g., ignore integration with ERM).'
    - Ensure distractors are realistic, web-grounded (e.g., from risk management pitfalls in NIST docs), and promote critical
      analysis.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Business Continuity Management
  (BCM). Topic: Annex L High-Level Structure Integration (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Business
  Continuity Planning > Business Continuity Fundamentals and Governance > BCM Framework and Standards > Annex L High-Level
  Structure Integration). Use NIST CSF as primary model (functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover; Profiles;
  Tiers) for integration into BCP/ERM, per research from nist.gov and bitsight.com.
