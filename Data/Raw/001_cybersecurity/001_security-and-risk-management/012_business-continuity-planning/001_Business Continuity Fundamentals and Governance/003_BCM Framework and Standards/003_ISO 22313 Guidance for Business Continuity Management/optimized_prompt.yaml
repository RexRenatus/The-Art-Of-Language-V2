  Research Context: ISO 22313:2020 provides guidance for implementing BCMS per ISO 22301. Key concepts: BCMS (policies/procedures
  for continuity); Business Continuity (delivery at acceptable levels post-disruption); Resilience (anticipate/prepare/respond/recover);
  Disruption (interrupting critical activities). Structured to follow ISO 22301 clauses with practical recommendations (sources:
  ISO.org/standard/75107.html, upguard.com/blog/iso-22301).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving where relevant.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards evenly across 4 layers [insert full scaffolding above]; label each.

  - Bloom''s Coverage: Balance across all 6 levels.
