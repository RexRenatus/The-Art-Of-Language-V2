active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how FISMA's contingency planning requirements enhance resilience compared
    to non-federal BCP standards. Provide examples from NIST guidelines and justify your position with evidence from a hypothetical
    federal agency disruption.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., confusing BIA with Risk
    Assessment), 2) Partial truths (e.g., omitting FISMA-specific federal mandates), 3) Related but incorrect concepts (e.g.,
    mixing with NIST non-FISMA BCP). Ensure distractors are realistic and sourced from typical errors in cybersecurity training.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in FISMA Compliance Requirements\
