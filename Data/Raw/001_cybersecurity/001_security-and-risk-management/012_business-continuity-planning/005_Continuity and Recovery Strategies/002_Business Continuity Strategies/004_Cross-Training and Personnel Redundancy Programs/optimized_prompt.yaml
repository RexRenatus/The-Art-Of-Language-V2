active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss the trade-offs between deep specialization in cybersecurity roles and broad cross-training for
    personnel redundancy. How might overemphasizing cross-training dilute expertise, and what strategies can balance this
    in a high-threat environment? Use examples from NIST CSF 2.0 Govern functions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Topic: ''Cross-Training and Personnel Redundancy Programs'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Business
  Continuity Planning > Continuity and Recovery Strategies > Business Continuity Strategies > Cross-Training and Personnel
  Redundancy Programs).


  Optimized Content (incorporating voter priorities: completed NIST CSF 2.0 - GV.OC-06 for workforce resilience; NICE Framework
  implicit via SP 800-181 Rev1 competency mappings; added sources; concise intro; implementation example; clarified implicit
  NICE reference):


  Concise Intro: Cross-training and personnel redundancy prevent personnel SPOFs, ensuring cybersecurity operational continuity
  and resilience.


  Core Concepts: Cross-Training (multi-role training, e.g., analysts learn forensics); Personnel Redundancy (multiple backups
  per function); SPOF (key person risk); Continuity/Resilience (sustained ops post-disruption).


  Frameworks: NIST CSF 2.0 (Govern: GV.OC-06 - Plan for resilient workforce with redundancy); NIST SP 800-181 Rev1 NICE Framework
  (implicit: maps competencies for cross-skilling). Sources: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-181r1.pdf;
  https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/cybersecurity-framework-20.


  Implementation Example: SOC cross-trains Tier 1 for Tier 2, drills quarterly.
