  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the role of cold sites in modern cybersecurity BCP: Are they still relevant
    given cloud services, or ideal only for cost-sensitive, non-critical systems? Use RTO/MTD examples and reference NIST
    SP 800-34 to support arguments, considering cross-links to supply chain risks and financial constraints.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    mixing with hot); 2) Extreme value (e.g., RTO=0 hours for cold); 3) Related but incorrect term (e.g., warm site traits).
    Ensure plausible via voter priorities (e.g., confuse RTO/MTD, site types).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Business Continuity Planning
  (BCP). Topic: ''Cold Site Infrastructure and Equipment Provisioning'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management
  > BCP > Continuity and Recovery Strategies > Technology Recovery Strategies > Cold Site Infrastructure and Equipment Provisioning).


  Incorporate:

  - Research: Cold site = infrastructure (power/HVAC/security) but no IT equipment; provisioning = acquire/install servers/storage/networking.
  NIST SP 800-34 Rev.1: Full contingency planning, BIA, TT&E (tabletop/walkthrough/parallel/full tests). Comparison: Cold
  (high RTO/cost low), Warm (med), Hot (low RTO/high cost).

  - Voter priorities: 4-layer scaffolding (Layer1: defs/RTO/MTD/BIA; Layer2: components/comparisons; Layer3: NIST steps/procurement;
  Layer4: BCP integration/cost-benefit/TT&E). Prerequisites: BIA/basic BCP. Big picture/cross-links: Supply chain/finance.


  Learning Objectives: [insert full list above].

  Active Learning: Use for scenario cards [insert summaries].

  Scaffolding: Generate cards progressively covering layers [insert full scaffolding above].


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards matching schema: [insert full flashcard_schema structure above]. Ensure coverage:
  25% remember/understand, 30% apply/analyze, 25% evaluate, 20% create. High-quality: Active recall, spaced repetition-friendly,
  university pedagogy (Bloom''s, scaffolding). No duplicates; vary phrasing.'
