active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using full backups exclusively versus hybrid strategies
    (full + incremental/differential) in a resource-constrained environment. Consider impacts on storage costs, backup windows,
    recovery speed, and compliance with NIST SP 800-53. Support arguments with RTO/RPO examples and propose a consensus recommendation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Strategies > Full Backup Methodology). Use provided research context on full backups, RTO/RPO, NIST CSF/SP 800-53, CIA triad.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the 6 objectives here]

  - Scaffolding Layers: Distribute cards evenly (10 per layer) across the 4 layers provided.

  - Active Learning: Infuse prompts tying to discussion (trade-offs), peer teaching (processes), problem-solving (scenarios).

  - Bloom''s Coverage: Even distribution across levels.

  - Voter Notes: No consensus; prioritize pedagogy.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly:

  [ paste schema here ]


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 40 flashcards: [flashcard1, flashcard2, ...]. Ensure variety: 40% Basic Q&A, 30% Cloze, 20%
  MCQ (with distractors), 10% Scenario-Apply. Cards must be concise (front <100 words), educational, and exam-ready. Reference
  sources like NIST where possible.'
