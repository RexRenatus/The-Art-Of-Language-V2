  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: (1) Semantic trap (similar term, e.g., ''After-Action Report'' instead
    of ''Review''), (2) Misconception (e.g., skipping facilitator neutrality), (3) Partial truth (e.g., NIST framework but
    wrong version). Ensure distractors are plausible from research context (e.g., CIA triad mix-ups) and voter priorities
    (e.g., abbreviation confusion).'

  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives**: [Insert full list above].

  - **Scaffolding Layers**: [Insert full descriptions above] – ensure flashcards progress from Layer 1 to 4.

  - **Active Learning**: Tie flashcards to components like discussions on PDCA loops or ransomware scenarios.

  - **Research Context**: Ground in NIST CSF 2.0, NIST SP 800-61, CIA triad, VA Handbook 6500.8 (federal post-exercise guidelines),
  sources (nvlpubs.nist.gov, growth.pecb.com, etc.). Distinguish AAR (process) vs. AAR Report (document). Use real-world examples
  (post-ransomware).

  - **Voter Priorities**: Explicit Bloom''s progression, 4-layer scaffold, facilitation steps, prerequisites, big-picture
  PDCA/BCP links, completeness (templates, roles).


  Generate 40-60 high-quality flashcards following the exact schema:

  [Insert full flashcard_schema above].


  Optimize for Anki/Quizlet: Questions active/recall-focused, explanations pedagogical (link to objectives/layers), distractors
  realistic. Ensure university-level rigor, measurable/assessable. Output ONLY the JSON array of flashcards.'
