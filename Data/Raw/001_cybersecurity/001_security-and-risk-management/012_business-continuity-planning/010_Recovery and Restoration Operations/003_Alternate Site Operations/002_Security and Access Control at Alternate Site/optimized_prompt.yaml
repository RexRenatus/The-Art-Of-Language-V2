  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Security controls at alternate sites can be temporarily
    relaxed during emergencies to prioritize speed.'' Use NIST CP-7 and real-world examples (e.g., hurricane data center failover)
    to support arguments for or against, and propose balanced mitigations.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    CP-8 vs CP-9), (4) Real-world pitfalls (e.g., cloud without equivalence). Ensure distractors are 70% plausible to primary

system_prompt: 'You are an expert cybersecurity educator and flashcard generator specializing in (ISC)² domains. Generate
  50 high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for the topic ''Security and Access Control at Alternate Site'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > Security And Risk Management > Business Continuity Planning > Recovery and Restoration Operations > Alternate Site Operations
  > Security and Access Control at Alternate Site). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning components, 4-layer
  scaffolding, and flashcard schema EXACTLY.


  **Content Foundation (Web-Grounded Research, Voter Consensus):** Base on NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5: CP-7 (Alternate Processing
  Site: Establish site with equivalent mission-essential capabilities, including security/access controls; no degradation);
  CP-8 (Telecommunications Services); CP-9 (Information System Backup). AC family (Access Control: RBAC, MFA); PE family (Physical
  Access). Best practices: Mirror primary site (physical: badges/guards/biometrics; logical: least privilege/MFA/VPN); risk
  assessment first; test regularly; avoid misconceptions like relaxed controls. Prior knowledge: CIA triad, BCP basics. Integration:
  Full BCP/DRP, cloud/hybrid (e.g., AWS failover with IAM). Real-world: Hurricane data center recovery, pandemic remote ops.
  Sources: NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final), SP 800-34, FIPS 199.


  **Pedagogical Integration:**

  - Align cards to 6 learning objectives (progressive Bloom''s: remember to create).

  - Inspire from active learning (e.g., scenario cards from problem-solving).

  - Distribute: 12-13 cards per scaffolding layer.

  - Prioritize voter inputs: Completeness (full NIST CP-7+), pedagogy (Bloom''s/scaffolding), misconceptions, connections
  (prereqs: BCP/risk; related: recovery/telecom; cross: cloud/supply chain).


  **Output Format:** JSON array of flashcards, each matching schema (front/back with answer/explanation/distractors, metadata).
  No extra text. Ensure active recall, spaced repetition optimization (concise fronts, rich backs).'
