active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare synchronous vs. asynchronous data synchronization strategies. What are the trade-offs in terms
    of RPO, RTO, bandwidth usage, and security risks in a cloud-hybrid environment? Debate with examples from recent cyber
    incidents, such as the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack and its impact on data recovery.
  peer_teaching: Pair students to explain data sync methods (e.g., mirroring, snapshot replication, log shipping). Each partner
    creates and administers a 3-question quiz on the method, then teaches back a real-world application, such as using rsync
    for offsite backups in an e-commerce firm.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: An e-commerce firm with 10TB of daily data changes faces a ransomware attack. In groups, design
    an optimal sync architecture between primary and alternate sites that minimizes data loss (RPO < 5 minutes) while controlling
    costs and bandwidth. Present and critique peer designs, referencing NIST SP 800-34.'

    Time Objective''); 2) Extreme (over/understate trade-off, e.g., ''zero bandwidth for sync''); 3) Unrelated but plausible
    (e.g., confuse with backups). Ensure distractors test deeper understanding per Bloom''s level.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, following university pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 25 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Data Synchronization
  Between Alternate and Primary Sites'' (Category: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Business Continuity Planning
  > Recovery and Restoration Operations > Reconstitution and Return to Normal).


  **Topic Context (Hierarchy & Research Summary):** Level 6 topic in hierarchy. Core: Sync data from primary (main ops) to
  alternate (DR site) for BC/DR resilience. Types: Synchronous (real-time, zero RPO, high BW); Asynchronous (delayed, better
  BW). Tools: rsync, DRBD, VMware SRM, log shipping. Metrics: RPO (data loss tolerance), RTO (downtime). Risks: Corruption,
  BW limits, ransomware (e.g., Colonial Pipeline 2021). NIST SP 800-34: Replication in contingency plans; NIST CSF: Recover
  via resilient sync. Uphold CIA Triad. Sources: NIST SP 800-34 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-34r1.pdf),
  NIST CSF (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), VMware SRM docs (https://www.vmware.com/products/site-recovery-manager.html).
