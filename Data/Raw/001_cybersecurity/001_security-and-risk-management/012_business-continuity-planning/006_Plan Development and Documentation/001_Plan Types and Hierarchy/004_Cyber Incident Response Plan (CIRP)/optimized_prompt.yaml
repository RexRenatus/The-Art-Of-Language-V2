active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the integration of CIRP within the broader plan hierarchy (e.g., how it
    supports BCP/DRP during a real-world data breach like the SolarWinds incident). Identify potential failure points and
    propose mitigations, citing NIST SP 800-61.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    with BCP steps); 2) Partial truths (e.g., correct phase but wrong order); 3) Related but incorrect concepts (e.g., mix
    NIST with ISO terms); 4) Edge cases from hierarchy (e.g., DRP vs. CIRP roles). Ensure distractors are realistic to challenge
    understanding without misleading.'
