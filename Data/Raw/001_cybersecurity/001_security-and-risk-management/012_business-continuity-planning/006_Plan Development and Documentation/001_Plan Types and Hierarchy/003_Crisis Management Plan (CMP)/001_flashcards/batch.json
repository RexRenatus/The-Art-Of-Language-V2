        "core_logic": "Verifying the integrity of restoration assets is paramount because using compromised or corrupted backups would reintroduce the threat or fail the recovery, thus undermining the entire process, since the goal is to return to a clean, functional state. This step works by checking backups for indicators of compromise or corruption before they are used.",
