      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Containment aims to stop an incident from spreading further, acting as an immediate damage control measure, whereas eradication focuses on removing the threat's presence and entry points, thus addressing the root cause to prevent recurrence, because these are sequential steps in incident handling.",
