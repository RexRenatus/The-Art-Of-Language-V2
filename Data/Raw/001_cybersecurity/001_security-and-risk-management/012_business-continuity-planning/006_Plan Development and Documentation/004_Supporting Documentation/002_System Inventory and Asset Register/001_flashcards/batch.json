        "core_logic": "Continuous monitoring is crucial because the threat landscape and system configurations change rapidly, necessitating ongoing risk assessment. It works by collecting data on security controls and system states, providing near real-time insights that enable timely risk management decisions and support ongoing authorization, rather than relying solely on periodic assessments.",
