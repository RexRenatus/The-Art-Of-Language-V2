    should organizations have applied C-SCRM principles preemptively? Cite NIST CSF 2.0 GV.SC and propose 3 policy changes
    (15 minutes, then share key insights).'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

    not allies''); (2) Similar term confusion (e.g., C-SCRM vs. general SCRM); (3) Outdated/irrelevant framework (e.g., NIST
    CSF 1.1 vs. 2.0). Ensure 1-2 are ''almost correct'' to test analysis.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Partner and Alliance Management
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Business Continuity Planning > Organizational Resilience
  and Culture > Stakeholder Management > Partner and Alliance Management). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning
  activities, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema to create 50 high-quality flashcards.


  **Context (Web-grounded Research):** Partner/Alliance Mgmt manages external risks via TPRM (third-party risks), C-SCRM (supply
  chain ICT risks per NIST), NIST CSF 2.0 GV.SC (full outcomes: GV.SC-01 strategy/policies, GV.SC-02 assess risks, GV.SC-03
  respond, GV.SC-04 improve), NIST SP 800-161r1, ISO 27001 A.15, CIS Controls #13. Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (nist.gov/cyberframework),
  NIST SP 800-161r1 (nist.gov/publications), ISO 27001:2022, CISA SCIRM guidelines. Big picture: Mitigates supply chain disruptions
  for BCP resilience (e.g., SolarWinds). Prerequisites: Basic risk mgmt.


  **Instructions:**

  - Balance Bloom''s: 5 Remember, 10 Understand, 15 Apply/Analyze, 20 Evaluate/Create.

  - Distribute across scaffolding layers evenly.

  - Incorporate voter priorities: SMART objectives, concept map links, complete frameworks.

  - Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards, each matching schema: {''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'',
  ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''active_learning_link'': ''...'', ''prerequisites'':
  ''...''}}

  - Ensure active recall: Questions test deep understanding, distractors per protocol.

  - Link to real-world: Cloud vendors, contracts, AI risks.'
