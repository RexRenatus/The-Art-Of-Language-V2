active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how investing in cyber resiliency transforms cybersecurity from a cost
    center into a competitive advantage. Use examples from NIST frameworks and real-world incidents (e.g., SolarWinds breach)
    to support arguments on trust, recovery speed, and market positioning.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 2-4 distractors that are plausible but incorrect: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., confuse
    ''withstand'' with ''prevent''); 2) Partial truths (e.g., list 3/4 functions); 3) Related but off-topic terms (e.g., ''detect''
    instead of ''anticipate''); 4) From adjacent domains (e.g., BCP recovery only, ignoring adapt). Ensure they test nuance
    from standards like NIST/ISO.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom's Taxonomy, active\
  \ learning, and evidence-based content from NIST/ISO standards. Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on 'Resilience as Competitive\
  \ Advantage' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Business Continuity Planning > Organizational\
  \ Resilience and Culture > Resilience Mindset and Culture > Resilience as Competitive Advantage). Base content on this optimized\
  \ synthesis:\n\n**Core Content:** Resilience enables organizations to anticipate, withstand, recover, adapt to cyber disruptions\
  \ (NIST SP 800-160 Vol. 2). Competitive advantages: trust, reputation, reduced losses, continuity. Standards: NIST SP 800-160\
  \ Vol. 2 (resiliency framework), ISO 22301 (BCP), NISTIR 8170 (CSF 1.1), NISTIR 8175 (workforce), CIS Controls. Scaffolding:\
  \ Layer 1 (definitions), Layer 2 (components/standards), Layer 3 (steps: assess/prioritize/test), Layer 4 (integrate with\
  \ BCP/supply chain/AI).\n\n**Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list from above].\n**Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Incorporate\
  \ prompts like discussions on advantages or problem-solving scenarios.\n\nDistribute flashcards: 20% Layer 1 (Remember/Understand),\
  \ 30% Layer 2 (Apply), 25% Layer 3 (Analyze), 25% Layer 4 (Evaluate/Create). 60% MCQ, 20% Cloze, 20% Short Answer.\n\n**Output\
  \ Format (JSON array of objects, one per flashcard):**\n{\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"front\": \"Question text\",\n  \"back\": {\n\
