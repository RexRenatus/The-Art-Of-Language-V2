active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what ways can leadership actions hinder or foster a resilience culture, and provide examples from
    recent cyber incidents such as the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack or SolarWinds supply chain breach? (Encourages
    critical thinking and real-world debate.)
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors from: 1. Common errors (e.g., resilience as ''just backups'' vs. mindset); 2.
    Adjacent concepts (e.g., mix CSF Functions like Identify vs. GOVERN); 3. Partial truths (e.g., Tier 3 as ''Adaptive'');
    Ensure 70% plausible to test deep understanding.'

  **Completed Research Context (NIST-grounded, comprehensive):** Core Concepts: Cyber Resilience (anticipate, withstand, recover,
  adapt; NIST SP 800-160 Vol. 2 Rev. 1); Resilience Culture (shared proactive responsibility); Systems Security Engineering;
  ERM integration (NIST CSWP 29). NIST CSF 2.0: GOVERN (GV.OC, GV.RM, GV.RR) central for strategy/oversight. Tiers: 1 Partial
  (ad hoc), 2 Risk Informed (prioritized), 3 Repeatable (defined processes), 4 Adaptive (innovative). Informative References:
  NIST CSF 2.0, SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (GOV controls), NISTIR 8286 (cyber in ERM), SP 800-160v2r1. Implementation Examples: Leadership
  training (e.g., C-suite resilience pledges); Metrics (culture surveys, RTO improvements); Case: Post-SolarWinds firms embedding
  Tier 4 via feedback loops.


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Use these Learning Objectives [insert array above]. Embed Active Learning [insert active_learning
  above] in flashcard explanations. Scaffold across 4 Layers [insert scaffolding_layers above]. Assessments: Quizzes (Remember),
  case analysis (Apply/Analyze), peer-reviewed plans (Create).


  **Generate 25 high-quality flashcards** following the exact Flashcard Schema [insert flashcard_schema above]. Ensure coverage:
  All Bloom''s levels/objectives, all layers, distractors per protocol, voter priorities (completeness, pedagogy). Output
  ONLY as JSON array per schema. No extra text.'
