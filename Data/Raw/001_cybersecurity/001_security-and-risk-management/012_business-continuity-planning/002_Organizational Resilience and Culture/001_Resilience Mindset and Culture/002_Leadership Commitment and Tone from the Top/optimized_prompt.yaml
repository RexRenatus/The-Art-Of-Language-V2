active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the impact of leadership commitment in the Equifax breach (2017). How might a stronger 'tone
    from the top' have prevented or mitigated the breach? Debate the role of the board (strategic oversight) vs. C-suite (operational
    accountability), addressing the misconception that cybersecurity is solely an IT issue.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 2-3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''cybersecurity is only
    IT''s job''); 2) Partial truth (e.g., confuses board with C-suite roles); 3) Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., ''leadership
    must handle all technical details''). Ensure distractors test nuance from NCSC frameworks/real examples (Equifax, SolarWinds).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on ''Leadership Commitment and Tone
  from the Top'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Business Continuity Planning > Organizational
  Resilience and Culture > Resilience Mindset and Culture > Leadership Commitment and Tone from the Top).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to discussion (Equifax), peer teaching (NCSC examples), problem-solving (ransomware plan).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute ~6 cards per layer [insert full scaffolding above].

  - Research: NCSC CAF Principle A1 (Leadership: Board/senior mgmt set risk appetite, integrate cyber into ERM); definitions
  from NCSC; examples (Equifax 2017, SolarWinds); prior knowledge (Enron tone).

  - Big Picture: Foundational for BCP/resilience; leadership prevents IT-silo failures.


  Use Flashcard Schema [insert full schema above]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcards, each as {"front": "...", "back":
  {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "bloom_level": "...", "scaffolding_layer": "...", "distractors": [...]}}. Vary types:
  20% MCQ with distractors, 80% Q&A. Ensure completeness (no truncations), progression through Bloom''s, and voter-approved
  pedagogy (measurable, critical thinking).'
