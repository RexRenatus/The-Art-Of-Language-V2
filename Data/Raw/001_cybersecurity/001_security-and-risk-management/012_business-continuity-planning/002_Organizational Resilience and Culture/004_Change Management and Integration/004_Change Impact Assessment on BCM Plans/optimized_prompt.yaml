  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Cybersecurity changes, such as adopting zero-trust architecture,
    always strengthen BCM plans without requiring full reassessment.'' Provide evidence from standards like NIST RMF and real-world
    examples, considering potential disruptions to recovery time objectives (RTO).'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per card: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Changes never affect RTO''); 2)
    Partial truth (e.g., overemphasizes one area like tech but ignores training); 3) Extreme opposite (e.g., ''Always requires
    full BCM rewrite''). Ensure distractors are realistic, derived from voter-noted gaps or typical errors in BCM (e.g., neglecting
    external threats).'

  Testing, Training, Personnel/Processes, Stakeholders) and pedagogy (Bloom''s progression, 4-layer scaffolding).


  Research Context (Complete): BCM identifies threats/impacts for resilience [Bryghtpath]; BCP maintains functions post-disruption
  [InvenioIT]; Cybersecurity Recovery restores post-incident [NIST SP 800-34]; Change Impact Assessment evaluates change consequences;
  RMF manages risks [NIST SP 800-37]. Key Areas: 1) BIA updates; 2) Threat Assessment (new cyber/external threats); 3) Recovery
  Strategies (RTO/RPO); 4) Testing; 5) Training; 6) Personnel/Processes; 7) Compliance/Stakeholders. Sources: NIST SP 800-34
  Rev. 1 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/34/r1/final), ISO 22301 (https://www.iso.org/standard/75106.html), NIST SP 800-37
  Rev. 2 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/37/r2/final), Bryghtpath BCM Guide (https://bryghtpath.com/business-continuity/),

  Incorporate: Learning Objectives [paste the 6 objectives above]; Active Learning [discussion/peer/problem-solving for engagement];
  Scaffolding [4 layers as defined]. Generate 50 flashcards (10 per Bloom''s pair: Remember/Understand, Apply/Analyze, Evaluate/Create;
  balance across layers). Use Flashcard Schema: Front (Q + [Bloom]); Back (Answer | Explanation w/ source | Bloom | 3 Distractors
  | Source). Vary formats: definition, MCQ, scenario-apply, analyze-compare. Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced
  repetition, distractors promote critical thinking. Output as markdown list: **Card 1** Front: ... Back: ...'
