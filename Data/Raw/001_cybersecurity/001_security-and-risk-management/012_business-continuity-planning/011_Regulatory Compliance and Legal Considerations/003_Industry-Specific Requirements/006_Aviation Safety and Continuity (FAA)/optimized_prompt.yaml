active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between FAA's proposed IUEI protections (e.g., standardized risk analysis and mitigation)
    and aircraft certification timelines/costs. Consider how these impact high-stakes industries like aviation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Conceptual (partial truth, e.g., ''focuses only on data networks, not cyber-physical''); 3) Misconception-based (e.g.,
    ''certification timelines increase without standardization''). Ensure distractors test understanding of FAA specifics
    vs. general cybersecurity.'

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: Use hooks like discussion on trade-offs, peer teaching on risk analysis, problem-solving scenarios.

  - Scaffolding: Prior Knowledge (BCP/risk basics); Big Picture (regulatory mastery); Layer 1: [layer1_foundation]; Layer
  2: [layer2_components]; Layer 3: [layer3_implementation]; Layer 4: [layer4_integration].

  - Sources: FAA Proposed Security Protection Regulations (2024), FAA Cybersecurity Strategy (2020), FAA Order JO 1370.128
  (NAS Cybersecurity Incident Detection, Reporting, and Response Policy), FAA.gov aviation cybersecurity pages.


  Follow this schema exactly:

  Distribute cards across Bloom''s levels (5 per level) and scaffolding layers (7-8 per layer). Ensure progressive difficulty:
  simple recall in Layer 1, application/analysis in Layers 2-3, evaluation/creation in Layer 4. Make cards active: include
  ''Apply this by...'' or ''Debate...'' prompts where relevant. Output as JSON array of objects: [{''type'': ''Basic Q&A'',
  ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...''}, ...].


  Key Content Completeness: IUEI (intentional unauthorized electronic interactions); Cyber-physical networks; Risk analysis
  steps; ICA (Instructions for Continued Airworthiness); Standardization reduces certification costs/time.'
