      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Foreign government entities are not explicitly listed as a fee category because FOIA fees are primarily structured around U.S. requesters' commercial, educational, news media, or 'all other' interests; therefore, their requests are typically handled under the 'all other' category unless specific agreements exist.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors represent the actual fee categories (commercial, news media, educational) that have specific fee structures or waivers, unlike foreign government entities which do not form a distinct category for fee assessment.",
        "analogy": "When ordering from a restaurant menu, 'commercial use' might be a business lunch special, 'news media' a food critic's discount, and 'educational institution' a student meal plan, but 'foreign tourist' isn't a separate menu category."
