  discussion_prompt: Does SOX mandate specific business continuity plans, or is resilience implied through ICFR requirements?
    Debate using case studies like Enron (financial reporting failures) or recent cyber incidents (e.g., ransomware attacks
    on financial systems leading to delayed SEC filings).

    - Plausible alternatives based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse SOX with HIPAA; assume explicit BCP mandate).
    - Use partial truths (e.g., correct section but wrong application).
    - Draw from research context errors (e.g., ignore Section 409 implications).
    - 'Vary difficulty: 1 easy (obvious wrong), 1 medium (superficially similar), 1 hard (subtle nuance).'

  **Completed Research Context (Voter-Approved Completeness):** The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) enhances corporate responsibility
  and financial reporting accuracy for U.S. public companies. While not explicitly mandating business continuity or cybersecurity,
  SOX implies robust BCP via internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR).

  - **Section 302:** CEO/CFO certify financial reports'' accuracy, including disclosure controls.

  - **Section 404:** Management assesses ICFR effectiveness (design/operation); auditors attest. ICFR must address IT risks
  to financial data integrity/availability (e.g., cyber threats disrupting reporting).

  - **Section 409:** Real-time disclosures of material changes/events impacting financials, implying rapid recovery post-disruption.

  Implications for BC: Ensure financial systems continuity (RTO/RPO aligned with reporting deadlines); test IT DR in ICFR
  audits. Examples: Ransomware halting quarter-end close = material weakness, SOX violation (e.g., delayed SEC filings). Sources:
  SEC.gov, COSO framework.


  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:** Basic BCP (continuity post-disruption), financial reporting, SOX intro.
