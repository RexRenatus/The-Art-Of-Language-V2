active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In groups, debate whether PCI DSS requirements are overly burdensome for small businesses handling payment
    cards. Use real-world examples like the 2013 Target breach to argue costs versus security benefits, and propose potential
    modifications to the standard. This sparks critical thinking on regulatory trade-offs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules (pre-v4.0), 4) Overgeneralizations (e.g., ''All encryption is strong''), 5) Real-world misconception (Target breach
    attribution). Ensure 70% MCQs, 20% cloze, 10% open-ended.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in PCI DSS. Use the provided
  topic hierarchy, research context, learning objectives, active learning components, scaffolding layers, and flashcard schema
  to create optimized flashcards.


  **Context:** [Insert full topic JSON above]. Focus on accuracy: PCI DSS v4.0, correct CHD/SAD/CDE distinctions, 12 requirements.
  Link to prior knowledge (CIA triad, encryption, access controls).


  **Instructions:**

  1. Generate 25 flashcards spanning all Bloom''s objectives and 4 scaffolding layers.

  2. Ensure active learning tie-ins (e.g., flashcards on Target breach for discussion, CHD/SAD for peer teaching, e-commerce
  scenarios for problem-solving).

  3. Strictly follow flashcard schema: MCQ-heavy with distractor protocol; include explanations referencing objectives/layers.

  4. Make engaging/pedagogical: Use scenarios, real-world examples.

  5. Output ONLY as JSON array per schema. No extra text.'
