      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The GDPR's right to rectification allows individuals to correct inaccurate personal data. On a blockchain, once data is recorded and validated, it becomes immutable. To 'rectify' inaccurate data, a common approach is to add a new transaction that supersedes the previous one, effectively marking the old data as incorrect. However, the original, inaccurate data often remains on the ledger, posing a challenge for complete data accuracy and potentially requiring additional measures to obscure or manage the superseded record.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly link rectification to encryption, assign direct regulatory intervention, or mistakenly believe immutability inherently fulfills the right, failing to recognize the challenge of updating immutable records and managing superseded data.",
        "analogy": "It's like trying to correct a typo in a published newspaper. You can issue a correction notice, but the original typo remains in the printed copies."
