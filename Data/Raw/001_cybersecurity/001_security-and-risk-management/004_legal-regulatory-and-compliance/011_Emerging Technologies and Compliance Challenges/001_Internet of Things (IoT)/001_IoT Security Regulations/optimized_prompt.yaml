  **Full Research Context:**

  The proliferation of IoT devices introduces risks like the Mirai botnet (exploited default passwords). Key regulations:

  - **ETSI EN 303 645 (13 Baseline Requirements):** 1. No default passwords. 2. Unique per-device passwords if defaults used.
  3. Vulnerability disclosure policy. 4. Secure storage of credentials. 5. Software update mechanism. 6. Minimized attack
  surface. 7. Secure communication. 8. Least privilege access. 9. Personal data protection. 10. Minimize data processed. 11.
  Public support contact. 12. Devices discoverable for updates. 13. Manufacturer instructions for security.

  - **NIST IR 8259:** Recommends similar baselines for IoT, emphasizing logical access, event logging, secure updates.

  - **UK PSTI Act (2022):** Bans weak/default passwords, mandates vulnerability reporting (within 14 days), 2-year min. update
  support.

  - **US Cyber Trust Mark (FCC, 2024):** Voluntary label for compliant devices; requires no defaults, updates, vulnerability
  disclosure.

  - **California SB-327 (2020):** Requires ''reasonable'' security features, unique defaults, no hard-coded creds.

  Core concepts: IoT (connected devices), attack surface, etc. Sources: ETSI.org (EN 303 645), NIST.gov (IR 8259), UK gov.uk/psti,
  FCC.gov/cyber-trust-mark, leginfo.legislature.ca.gov (SB-327).


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives from above JSON].

  **Active Learning Integration:** Embed discussion/problem-solving in higher-level cards (e.g., evaluate Mirai gaps).

  **Scaffolding:** Distribute cards: 30% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 20% Layer 4.

  **Flashcard Generation Rules:**

  - Cover all objectives/Bloom''s levels proportionally (Remember:20%, Understand:20%, Apply:20%, Analyze/Evaluate/Create:40%).

  - Mix types: 40% basic Q/A, 40% MCQ (4 options, 1 correct), 20% cloze.

  - Use schema: [Insert flashcard_schema structure].

  - Distractors per protocol.

  - Questions promote active recall (e.g., ''What ETSI provision requires...?'').

  - Ensure diversity: global regs, examples (Mirai, smart thermostat).


  **Output Format:** JSON array of 50 objects, each matching a schema type. No extra text.'
