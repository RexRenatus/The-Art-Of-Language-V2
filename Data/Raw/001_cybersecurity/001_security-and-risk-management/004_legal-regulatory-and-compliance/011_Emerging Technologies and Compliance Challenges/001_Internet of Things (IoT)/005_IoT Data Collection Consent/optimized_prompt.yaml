  discussion_prompt: Is a simple 'I Agree' checkbox on an IoT device setup screen sufficient for valid consent under GDPR?
    Debate using examples from smart home devices like thermostats or cameras, considering factors like granularity, withdrawability,
    and vulnerability of users (e.g., elderly).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truths (e.g., ''GDPR requires consent always'' - wrong, alternatives exist); 3) Edge cases (e.g., mix UK GDPR
    with CCPA); 4) Outdated info (e.g., pre-GDPR rules). Ensure 1 clearly correct, others induce typical errors. Explain why
    each distractor is wrong.'
