active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between functionality and privacy in IoT devices (e.g.,
    smart home cameras). Use the NIST Privacy Framework's Govern and Communicate functions to argue for or against mandatory
    privacy-by-design. Reference case studies like Ring hacks to support your position.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Content Summary (Complete per Voter Consensus 100% Approval):**

  - **Big Picture:** Fits Security and Risk Management mastery; addresses IoT proliferation compliance challenges.

  - **Prior Knowledge:** GDPR/CCPA basics, IoT fundamentals.

  - **Core Concepts:** IoT (NIST IR 8228); Privacy Risk (problems from data processing: embarrassment to economic loss); Cybersecurity
  Risk; Data Processing/Actions (collect, retain, etc.).

  - **NIST Privacy Framework (Full):** Core: Identify (ID: risks), Govern (GV: policies), Control (CT: protections), Communicate
  (CM: transparency). Profiles: Current/Target. Tiers: 1 Partial (ad hoc), 2 Risk Informed (defined), 3 Repeatable (managed),
  4 Adaptive (innovative).

  - **HITRUST:** IoT controls (access, data protection).

  - **Case Studies:** Ring hacks (video sharing breaches), Fitbit (health data leaks).

  - **Concept Map:** Central ''Connected Device Privacy'' -> IoT, Privacy Risk, Data Processing, NIST/HITRUST; links: Data
  Actions -> Risks -> Controls -> Compliance.

  - **Sources:** NIST Privacy Framework v1.0 (https://www.nist.gov/privacy-framework), IR 8228 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/ir/8228/final),
  HITRUST CSF.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list from above].

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full descriptions from above].

  **Active Learning Integration:** Flashcards should prompt recall for discussions (e.g., ''Debate prompt scenario''), peer
  teaching (e.g., ''Explain function as if teaching''), problem-solving (e.g., ''Solve Ring case'').


  **Generate Flashcards:** Create 75 flashcards using exact schema:

  - **Front:** [Format as specified], e.g., ''Layer 2, Apply: What NIST Core function governs org-wide privacy policies? A)
  ID B) GV C) CT D) CM''

  - **Back:** Answer: **GV**. Explanation: [Detailed, 50-100 words, link to objective/layer/case]. Distractors: [List why
  wrong]. Refs: [Sources].

  Balance: Layers/Objectives even. Ensure completeness, pedagogy, real-world relevance. Output as markdown list: ### Card
