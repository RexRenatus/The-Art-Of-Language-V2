  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the classification of generative AI tools like ChatGPT: Should they always
    be treated as High-Risk, or is the GPAI framework sufficient? Use examples of potential harms and benefits to argue positions,
    referencing Act definitions and obligations.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert EU AI Act compliance educator, synthesizing university-level flashcards for Cybersecurity
  > Security And Risk Management > Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance > Emerging Technologies and Compliance Challenges > Artificial
  Intelligence and Machine Learning > EU AI Act Compliance. Ensure 100% completeness: Cover Unacceptable (banned), High-Risk
  (full Provider/Deployer obligations: risk mgmt, data governance, docs, record-keeping, transparency, oversight, accuracy/robustness/cybersec),
  Limited (transparency: chatbots/emotion/deepfakes), Minimal (voluntary), GPAI (transparency, systemic risks, incidents),
  timelines, enforcement/penalties (€35M/7% turnover).


  Incorporate: Learning objectives [paste array]; Active learning for context (e.g., flashcards support classification/discussion);
  Scaffolding layers [paste scaffolding JSON] with just-in-time examples/diagrams described.
