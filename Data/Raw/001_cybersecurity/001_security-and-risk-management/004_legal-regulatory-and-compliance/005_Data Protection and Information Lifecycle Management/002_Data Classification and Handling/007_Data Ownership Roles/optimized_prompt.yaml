  discussion_prompt: 'In a scenario where a company uses AWS for customer data storage, debate who bears ultimate responsibility
    for a data breach: the Data Owner (company), Data Custodian (IT team), or Data Processor (AWS)? Consider legal vs. operational
    accountability, referencing GDPR controller/processor distinctions and shared responsibility models.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Equifax). 3. Include partial truths (e.g., 'Custodian is legally accountable' – no, Owner is). 4. Always 3 distractors
    with detailed explanations tying back to definitions/standards.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in CISSP-aligned content.
  Topic: Data Ownership Roles (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance
  > Data Protection and Information Lifecycle Management > Data Classification and Handling > Data Ownership Roles). Use this
  exact content for accuracy:


  [Insert full Research Context, Voter Suggestions, Scaffolding Layers, Learning Objectives, Active Learning here].


  Generate 40 high-quality flashcards (5-10 per Bloom''s level, distributed across 4 scaffolding layers). Ensure coverage:
  20% foundation basics, 25% role definitions/relationships, 25% scenarios/applications (e.g., AWS, Equifax), 30% standards/integration
  (CISSP, NIST, ISO 27001, GDPR). Incorporate active learning elements into questions (e.g., debate-style for ANALYZE).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each strictly following the Flashcard Schema. No extra text. Validate: Exactly 4
  options (1 correct), 3 distractors with explanations, valid bloom_level enum, layer 1-4.'
