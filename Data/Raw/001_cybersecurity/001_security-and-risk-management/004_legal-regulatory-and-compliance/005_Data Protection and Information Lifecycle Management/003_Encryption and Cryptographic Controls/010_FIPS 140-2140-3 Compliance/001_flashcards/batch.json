        "core_logic": "The Cryptographic Boundary is fundamental to FIPS 140-2/140-3 because it precisely defines what is considered part of the cryptographic module. By explicitly delineating hardware, software, and firmware components within this perimeter, it ensures that all security-relevant elements are subject to the standard's requirements and testing, thereby preventing security loopholes.",
