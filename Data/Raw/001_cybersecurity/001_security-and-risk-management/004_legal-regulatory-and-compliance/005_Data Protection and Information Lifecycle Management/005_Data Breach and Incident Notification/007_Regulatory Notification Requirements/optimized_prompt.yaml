  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the following: ''In a ransomware attack on a bank service provider that disrupts operations for
    12 hours but no data is exfiltrated, does it qualify as a Notification Incident under OCC rules? Why or why not? Consider
    impacts on financial stability and use real-world examples like the MOVEit breach.'' Encourage critical thinking by requiring
    evidence from regulations and peer counterarguments.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    72h), 2) Similar but incorrect reg/timeline (e.g., FDIC 36h instead of 72h; SEC 24h), 3) Edge case reversal (e.g., non-material
    as material). Ensure distractors test subtle differences (e.g., Cybersecurity vs. Notification Incident). Base on real-world
    confusions from cases like Equifax.'
