        "core_logic": "Establishing a media sanitization program is crucial because it institutionalizes the process, ensuring that sanitization is performed consistently and effectively across the organization, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches. This program-based approach aligns with broader cybersecurity and risk management frameworks.",

        "analogy": "Think of a company's safety program. The goal isn't just to have safety equipment, but to have clear procedures, training, and oversight so everyone knows how to work safely. A media sanitization program does the same for data disposal."

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Degaussing is not recommended for all media types because it is primarily effective on magnetic media (like HDDs and tapes) and is generally ineffective for solid-state media (SSDs, flash drives) due to their different storage mechanisms. NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 2 specifies that the chosen method must be appropriate for the media type.",
        "distractor_analysis": "CE, secure overwrite, and physical destruction are all recognized methods within NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 2, though their applicability and effectiveness depend on the specific media and data sensitivity.
