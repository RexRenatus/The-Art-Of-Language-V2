        "core_logic": "The 24-hour reporting deadline for ransom payments under the CIRCI Act is crucial because it allows CISA to track ransom trends, identify actors, and potentially disrupt illicit financial flows associated with ransomware attacks, thereby enhancing national security.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly apply the 72-hour incident reporting timeline, the SEC's four-business-day rule, or suggest a less precise trigger than the actual payment date, missing the specific focus on ransom payment activity.",
        "analogy": "It's like a regulation requiring a business to report any bribe paid within 24 hours to law enforcement, so they can track illicit payments and potentially catch those demanding them."
