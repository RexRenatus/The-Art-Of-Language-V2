active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss the role of law enforcement notification in the Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident (2021).
    How might adherence to CJIS Security Policy IR-6 timelines (e.g., 1-hour FBI reporting for CJI-impacting events) have
    altered the coordinated response? Relate this to your prior knowledge of GDPR 72-hour notification rules and potential
    legal penalties for non-compliance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Plausible but incorrect: e.g., Wrong timeline (24 hours instead of 1 hour), confuse PII with CJI, mix NIST/CJIS reqs,
      common misconceptions (e.g., ''No notification if mitigated internally'').'
    - 'Balance: 1 timeline error, 1 scope error (e.g., non-CJI incident), 1 agency confusion (FBI vs CISA).'
    - 'Avoid: Obvious falsehoods; ensure distractors teach via correction in explanation.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² CISSP-aligned topics.
  Topic: Law Enforcement Notification (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance
  > Incident Response and Compliance > Incident Reporting and Communication > Law Enforcement Notification). Use the provided
  learning objectives, active learning ideas, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema EXACTLY.


  Context: Focus on CJIS Security Policy v5-9-5 (IR-6: 1-hour FBI reporting for CJI incidents), NIST SP 800-61r3, CISA/FBI
  guidelines. Key terms: Cyber Incident, CJI, PII. Steps: Detect > Assess > Internal notify (CSO/SIB) > External report. Integrations:
  NIST IR, automation, examples like Colonial Pipeline.


  Generate 25 flashcards following the schema. Ensure progression: foundation to integration. Incorporate voter consensus
  (68.6% approval): complete CJIS details, timelines, steps, NIST links.


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of objects, each: {''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''source'': ''...'', ''related_objective'': ''1-6'', ''scaffolding_layer'': 1-4}}. No extra text.'
