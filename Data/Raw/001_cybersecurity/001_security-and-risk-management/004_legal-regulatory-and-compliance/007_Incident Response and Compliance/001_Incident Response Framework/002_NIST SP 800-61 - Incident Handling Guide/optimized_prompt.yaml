  \ Handling Guide (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance > Incident\
  \ Response and Compliance > Incident Response Framework > NIST SP 800-61). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (12-15 per\

  \nIncorporate:\n- Learning Objectives: [Insert full list above].\n- Active Learning: Tie cards to discussion (e.g., Rev3/CSF\
  \ debate), peer teaching (phase explanations), problem-solving (ransomware scenarios).\n- Scaffolding Layers: [Insert full\
  \ layers above]; tag each card with layer/Bloom level.\n- Research Context: Rev2 phases (Preparation: CSIRT/tools/policies;\
  \ Detection & Analysis: indicators/prioritization; Containment/Eradication/Recovery: mitigate/restore; Post-Incident: lessons).\
  \ Rev3 (Apr 2025): CSF 2.0 alignment. Definitions: Event/Adverse Event/Incident/CSIRC.\n\nOutput Format (JSON array of flashcards):\n\
