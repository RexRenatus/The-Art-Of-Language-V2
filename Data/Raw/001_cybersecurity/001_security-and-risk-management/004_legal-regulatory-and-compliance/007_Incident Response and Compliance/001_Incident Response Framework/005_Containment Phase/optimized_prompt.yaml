    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ.
    - 'Distractor types: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse containment with eradication), 2) Similar concept (e.g., detection
      vs. containment), 3) Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Always shut down entire network'').'
    - 'Ensure 4 options total: 1 correct, 3 distractors randomized.'
    - Avoid 'all/none' options; make correct ~25-30% obvious only after reasoning.
    card_types: 50% MCQ, 20% True/False (with distractor explanation), 20% Short Answer/Cloze, 10% Scenario-based Apply/Analyze.
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in the 'Containment Phase'\
  \ (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance > Incident Response\
