active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the impact of the Schrems II ruling on EU-US data transfers. In groups, debate whether SCCs
    alone are sufficient safeguards today (post-2021 updates) and propose alternatives like BCRs or pseudonymization strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Legal, Regulatory, and
  Compliance topics. Generate high-quality, pedagogically optimized flashcards for ''Cross-Border Data Transfers'' (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance > Privacy and Data Protection
  Regulations > GDPR > Cross-Border Data Transfers).


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING DESCRIPTION FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use concepts from discussions/problems to inspire scenario-based cards.

  - Ensure progression: Foundation cards (remember/understand), build to integration (evaluate/create).

  - Key Content: GDPR Chapter V (Adequacy, SCCs w/TIAs post-Schrems II, BCRs, derogations); Comparisons (CCPA: no adequacy
  but ''sale'' limits; LGPD: adequacy-like; POPIA: comparable protection); Best practices (encryption, audits); Risks (Schrems
  II, surveillance).
