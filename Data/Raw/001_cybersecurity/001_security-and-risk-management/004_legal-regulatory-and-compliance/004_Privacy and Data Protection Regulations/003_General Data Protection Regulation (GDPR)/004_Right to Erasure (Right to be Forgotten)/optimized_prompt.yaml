active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent should the Right to be Forgotten override public interest, such as in cases of public
    figures or criminal records? Divide into groups representing data subjects, data controllers, journalists, and regulators
    to debate, reference GDPR Article 17(3) exceptions and the Google Spain ECJ case, and propose balanced policies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    ''Right is absolute'' vs. exceptions; confuse grounds like consent vs. objection). Distractors from real-world errors
    (e.g., ICO fines cases), similar GDPR articles, or partial truths. Ensure 1 distractor is a frequent exception misapplication.'

  Incorporate these exactly:

  - Learning objectives: [paste the full array from ''learning_objectives'']

  - Scaffolding layers: [paste descriptions from ''scaffolding'']

  - Active learning: Tie explanations to discussion (public interest debate), peer teaching (grounds/exceptions), problem-solving
  (employee scenario, Google Spain).

  - Prior knowledge: GDPR basics (personal data, consent, rights overview).

  - Completeness: Full exceptions (freedom of expression, legal obligations, public interest, public health, archiving/research,
  legal claims). Sources: GDPR Article 17 (full text), Google Spain ECJ case (2014), ICO guidance on erasure requests.


  Use this exact schema for output: JSON array of objects [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''type'': ''Q&A|MCQ|Cloze'',
  ''bloom_level'': ''Remember|Understand|Apply|Analyze|Evaluate|Create'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''1|2|3|4'', ''explanation'':
  ''...''}].

  Distribute: 10 Layer1 (Remember/Understand), 15 Layer2 (Understand/Apply), 15 Layer3 (Apply/Analyze), 10 Layer4 (Analyze/Evaluate/Create).
  MCQs: Follow distractor protocol. Ensure active recall, no hints on front, precise language. Avoid overlap; vary phrasing
  for robustness.'
