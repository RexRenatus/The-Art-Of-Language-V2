  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the following scenario: A company experiences a data breach affecting
    500 EU customers'' emails but no sensitive data. Is Article 33 notification required? Why or why not? Consider risk to
    rights and freedoms, and compare to a similar US SEC materiality threshold. Support with GDPR Article 33 evidence.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., 24-hour timeline instead of 72)'
    - 'Distractor 2: Confuse with related concept (e.g., Art. 34 subject communication vs. Art. 33 DPA notification)'
    - 'Distractor 3: US-centric mix-up (e.g., SEC 4-day materiality vs. GDPR risk-based), contextualized as supplementary'
    - Ensure distractors are plausible, derived from voter-noted inaccuracies (e.g., overemphasizing NIST/SEC)

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in GDPR under Privacy and
  Data Protection Regulations. Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance
  > Privacy and Data Protection Regulations > General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) > Supervisory Authority Reporting.
  Focus strictly on GDPR Articles 33-34 for personal data breach notifications to supervisory authorities (72-hour timeline,
  content requirements); contextualize NIST/SEC as supplementary integrations only.
