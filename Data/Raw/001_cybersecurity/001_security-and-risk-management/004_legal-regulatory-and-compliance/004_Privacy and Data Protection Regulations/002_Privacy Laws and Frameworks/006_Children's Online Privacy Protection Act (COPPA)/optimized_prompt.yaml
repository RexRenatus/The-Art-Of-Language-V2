  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the effectiveness of COPPA in the age of AI-driven personalization: Does it adequately protect
    children or hinder innovation? Use real-world cases like the FTC''s $170M fine against YouTube for COPPA violations and
    emerging AI tools collecting child voice data.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
