active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether PIPL's extraterritorial scope poses greater challenges for multinational
    tech companies than GDPR's, using examples of cross-border data transfers and enforcement penalties. Support with PIPL
    principles like transparency and data minimization.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    with GDPR''s 4%; mix consent with general PI; reference CSL instead of PIPL). Ensure distractors are realistic from research/voter
    gaps (e.g., incorrect extraterritorial scope, missing explicit consent for sensitive PI).'

  Use this comprehensive PIPL content (effective Nov 1, 2021; alongside CSL/DSL):

  - Foundation: Definitions (PI: identified/identifiable data; Sensitive PI: biometrics/health/etc., explicit consent needed;
  Processor/Handler).

  - Components: Scope (PRC + extraterritorial for China users); Principles (legality, necessity, minimization, accuracy, security,
  responsibility, transparency: full disclosure); Lawful bases (consent, contract, etc.).

  - Implementation: Rights (access/correct/delete/withdraw/explain/objection); Consent (informed/granular); Security (measures/breach
  notice); DPIA/audits/DPO; Cross-border (CAC assessment/standard contracts/certification).

  - Integration: Enforcement (CAC; fines ≤50M RMB or 5% revenue); vs GDPR (similar consent/scope, PIPL localization focus);
  Cases (hypothetical breaches).
