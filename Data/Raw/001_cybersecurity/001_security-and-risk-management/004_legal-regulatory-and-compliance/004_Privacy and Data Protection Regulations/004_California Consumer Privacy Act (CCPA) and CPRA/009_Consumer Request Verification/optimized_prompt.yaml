active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the balance between robust consumer request verification (e.g., IAL2/3 per NIST SP 800-63A) and
    user friction in CCPA/CPRA compliance. When might lower IAL1 suffice for requests like opt-out, and what privacy or security
    risks does it pose? Support arguments with CCPA 'reasonable methods' examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    with authentication (e.g., ''Uses passwords only''); 2) Ignore CCPA timelines/methods (e.g., ''90-day response''); 3)
    Misstate IAL requirements (e.g., ''IAL1 requires biometrics''); 4) Over/understate risks (e.g., ''No friction with IAL3'').
    Ensure distractors are realistic from research context.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in CCPA/CPRA Consumer Request\
