active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare the risk-based auditing approach in ISO 19011 to traditional checklist methods in a cybersecurity
    context like ISO 27001 audits. What are the pros, cons, and potential misconceptions (e.g., overlooking low-probability
    high-impact risks)? Discuss in groups and share insights on how this applies to continuous improvement in security programs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    with ''audit scope''); 2) Partial truths (e.g., risk-based ignores low risks); 3) Related but incorrect terms (e.g., ''subjective
    evidence'' vs. objective); 4) Cybersecurity misapplications (e.g., ISO 27001-specific vs. general ISO 19011). Ensure distractors
    test subtle understanding and prevent rote memorization.'

  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives** (span Bloom''s): [Insert full list above].

  - **Active Learning**: Weave in prompts/activities for reinforcement (e.g., reference discussion on risk-based vs. checklist).

  - **Scaffolding** (4 layers): [Insert full descriptions above]. Ensure flashcards progress from Layer 1 to 4.

  - **Research Context**: Use ISO 19011:2018 definitions (Audit: systematic, independent process for objective evidence vs.
  criteria; Management System: interrelated elements for policies/objectives; Audit Programme: set of audits over timeframe;
  Audit Criteria: requirements reference; Objective Evidence: verifiable data; Audit Findings: results). Link to ISO 27001
  cybersecurity audits. Sources: oshisis.com/docs/iso-190112018.

  - **Prior Knowledge**: Activate basics like ISO 27001, compliance, management systems.

  - **Big Picture**: ISO 19011 enables certification, continuous improvement in cybersecurity compliance.

  - **Concept Map**: Central ''ISO 19011'' → Audit Principles/Programme/Conducting → subs (Criteria→Evidence→Findings).

  - **Cybersecurity Focus**: Examples for ISO 27001 audits, GDPR post-breach scenarios.


  **Output Format**: JSON array of flashcards. Each: {"id":1, "bloom_level":"Remember", "scaffolding_layer":"1", "front":"Question
  text", "back":"Answer | Explanation (detailed, with why correct/distractors wrong, active learning tie-in, source)", "type":"mcq/qa/cloze",
  "options":["A","B","C","D"] (for MCQ)}.


  **Generation Rules** (per Flashcard Schema): [Insert full schema above]. Balance: 10-15 per Bloom''s level/layer. Ensure
  high-quality, measurable, engaging for active recall. Vary difficulty; include 10% CREATE/EVALUATE scenario cards.'
