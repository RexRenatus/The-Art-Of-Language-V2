active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of NIST SP 800-53 AU controls, debate the trade-offs between comprehensive audit trail
    generation for non-repudiation and accountability versus potential privacy violations (e.g., GDPR conflicts) and storage
    overload. Use real-world examples like the Equifax breach where insufficient logging hindered investigations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
