active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the balance between privileged user monitoring for compliance (e.g., GDPR Article 30, SOX) and
    employee privacy rights. In groups, propose a policy that mitigates risks while respecting privacy—justify with references
    to NIST SP 800-53 controls.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse PUM with PAM; mix up NIST controls
      like AU-2 vs AU-12; overlook privacy vs compliance).
    - 'Distractors must be realistic: e.g., for ''Primary goal of PUM?'', distractors like ''Productivity tracking'' (misconception
      for regular users), ''External threat blocking'' (not privileged focus), ''Password rotation only'' (PAM subset).'
    - Ensure 1-2 distractors are 'close but wrong' (e.g., related control like AC-6 instead of AU-2).
    - 'Balance: 40% definition flashcards, 30% MCQ, 20% apply/analyze scenarios, 10% evaluate/create.'

  Use the following to generate 50 high-quality flashcards:


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the ''learning_objectives'' array here verbatim].


  **Active Learning Hooks:** [Insert the ''active_learning'' object here verbatim]. Tie flashcards to these where relevant.


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the ''scaffolding_layers'' object here verbatim]. Distribute flashcards: ~12-13 per layer,
  progressing Bloom''s levels.


  **Flashcard Schema:** [Insert the ''flashcard_schema'' object here verbatim]. Output in JSON array of objects: [{''front'':
  ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''1-4'', ''active_hook'':
  ''optional''}}].


  **Research Context:** PUM monitors elevated access accounts (admins, service accounts) for insider threats/compliance. Key
  standards: NIST SP 800-53 (AU-2 audit events, AU-12 generation, AC-6 least privilege), CIS Controls 6, PCI-DSS Req 10, GDPR
  Art 30, SOX, HIPAA. Tools: CyberArk, BeyondTrust, SIEM. Prior knowledge: RBAC, least privilege, logging basics.


  Ensure factual accuracy, pedagogical progression, and engaging distractors. Vary question types for active recall.'
