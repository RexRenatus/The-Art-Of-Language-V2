  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the following: ''How have ethical lapses by cybersecurity professionals
    (e.g., insider threats or non-disclosure violations) hindered the profession''s advancement, and what role do codes like
    the (ISC)² Code of Ethics play in preventing this? Provide real-world examples and propose solutions.'' Encourage participants
    to reference voter-suggested elements like certifications and lifelong learning.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
