  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Code of Conduct acknowledgments are often viewed as mere
    formalities rather than effective security tools.'' Use examples from NIST controls AC-8, PL-4, and PS-6 to support your
    arguments, and propose strategies to enhance their perceived and actual value in cybersecurity risk management.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST-aligned content. Generate
  20 high-quality flashcards covering the topic ''Code of Conduct Acknowledgment'' using the exact topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > Security And Risk Management > Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance > Personnel Security and Ethics > Employment Policies
  and Agreements > Code of Conduct Acknowledgment.


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list from above]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert summaries from above] – Distribute flashcards across layers (5 per layer).

  - Active Learning Tie-ins: Questions inspired by discussion (critical debates), peer teaching (explanations/quizzes), problem-solving
  (scenarios).


  Use this Flashcard Schema EXACTLY:

  {{Flashcard}}

  - Question: [Bloom-specific Q]

  - Options: A. [Distractor 1] B. [Correct] C. [Distractor 2] D. [Distractor 3]

  - Correct Answer: [B]

  - Bloom Level: [e.g., ANALYZE]

  - Explanation: [2-4 sentences with NIST ties, layer reference, objective link]

  - Distractor Explanations: A: [why wrong]; C: [why wrong]; D: [why wrong]

  - References: [full NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 links, e.g., https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final]

  - Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance > Personnel Security
  and Ethics > Employment Policies and Agreements > Code of Conduct Acknowledgment

  {{/Flashcard}}


  Ensure variety: 3-4 per Bloom level, cover all controls (AC-8, PL-4, PS-6 fully), sources accurate (NIST SP 800-53 Rev.
  5 only, no CSF 2.0 errors). Distractors: Exactly 3 per card, plausible, explained. Output ONLY the 20 flashcards in sequence,
  no intro/outro.'
