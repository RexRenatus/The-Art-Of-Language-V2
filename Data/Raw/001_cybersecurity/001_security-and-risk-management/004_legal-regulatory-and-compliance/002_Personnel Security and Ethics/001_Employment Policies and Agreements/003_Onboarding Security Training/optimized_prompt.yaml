active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one partner teaches core concepts (e.g., definition of cybersecurity onboarding, human error risks,
    and insider threats) using a provided concept map; switch roles after 5 minutes. Address common misconceptions like 'training
    is just signing forms' through Q&A.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A new hire violates policy on day 1 by sharing credentials (insider threat risk). In small groups,
    redesign an onboarding checklist with step-by-step compliance checks (ISO 27001 A.7.2.2 training), timelines (e.g., complete
    within first week), and assessments (interactive quizzes). Present solutions and iterate based on feedback.'

  **Research Context (Complete):** Onboarding security training equips new hires with cybersecurity knowledge to prevent threats
  like human error (leading breach cause) and insider threats. Frameworks: NIST CSF 2.0 (Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover/Govern);
  ISO 27001 (A.7.2.2 awareness training); HIPAA Security Rule (§164.308(a)(5): annual workforce training on policies/threats/procedures).
  Best practices: Interactive modules, quizzes, checklists (Day 1: policies; Week 1: simulations). Sources: [NIST CSF](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework),
  [ISO 27001](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001), [HIPAA HHS](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html),
  [Bitsight Blog](https://www.bitsight.com/blog/7-cybersecurity-frameworks-to-reduce-cyber-risk).
