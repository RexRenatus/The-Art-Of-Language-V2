        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors misinterpret the statute by suggesting a complete ban on all outside pay, a ban on all gifts, or a salary comparison, rather than the specific prohibition against outside payments for official government work.",
        "analogy": "A government scientist working on a public health initiative cannot accept payment from a private pharmaceutical company to speed up their research on a drug that company produces, as this would be supplementing their federal salary for official duties."
