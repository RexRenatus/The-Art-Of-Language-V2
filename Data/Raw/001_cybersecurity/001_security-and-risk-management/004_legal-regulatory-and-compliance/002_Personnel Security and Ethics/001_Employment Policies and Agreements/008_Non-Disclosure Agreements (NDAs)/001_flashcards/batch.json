        "core_logic": "The no-reverse-engineering clause is vital because it protects the intellectual property and competitive advantage embedded in disclosed information, since reverse engineering could allow the recipient to replicate the innovation without authorization.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors confuse the clause with the general non-disclosure obligation, mandate improvement, or IP ownership, missing its specific focus on prohibiting the deconstruction of disclosed information.",
        "analogy": "A 'no-reverse-engineering' clause in an NDA is like telling someone they can borrow your unique tool but can't take it apart to figure out how to make their own identical copy."
