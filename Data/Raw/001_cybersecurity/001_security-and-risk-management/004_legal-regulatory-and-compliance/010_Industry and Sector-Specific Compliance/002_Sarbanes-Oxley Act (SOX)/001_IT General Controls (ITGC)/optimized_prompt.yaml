  Incorporate this synthesized content:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use elements to inspire scenario-based questions.

  - Scaffolding: Generate flashcards proportionally across 4 layers: [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING CONTENT FROM ABOVE]. Ensure
  coverage of all ITGC categories: Access, Change Management (approval, testing, deployment), IT Operations (backups, scheduling),
  Program Development/SDLC, Physical/Environmental.

  - Distinguish ITGC from application controls; emphasize CIA triad and SOX 404.


  Output 60 flashcards in JSON array format: [{''front'': ''Question with 4 MC options (A-D, mark correct as **B**)'', ''back'':
  {''correct'': ''B. Answer text'', ''explanation'': ''Detailed 2-4 sentence rationale with Bloom\''s level, layer ref, SOX
  link'', ''distractors'': [''Why A wrong...'', ''Why C wrong...'', ''Why D wrong...'']}}].


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: MCQ structure, distractor protocol (misconception, partial truth, extreme). Progressive
  difficulty matching Bloom''s. High-quality, exam-ready for certifications like CISA/CISM.'
