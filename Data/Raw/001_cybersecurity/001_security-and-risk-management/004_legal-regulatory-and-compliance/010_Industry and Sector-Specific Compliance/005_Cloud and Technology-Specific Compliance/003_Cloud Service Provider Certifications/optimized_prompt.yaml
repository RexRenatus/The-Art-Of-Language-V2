active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of relying solely on CSP certifications like SOC 2 and
    ISO 27001 for compliance versus implementing customer-specific controls. Use real-world examples from AWS, Azure, or GCP
    to support your arguments and consider industry-specific needs (e.g., PCI DSS for finance).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    with 27018), 2) Similar but incorrect standard (e.g., SOC 1 vs SOC 2), 3) Out-of-scope or outdated info (e.g., non-cloud
    specific cert). Ensure distractors promote critical thinking without misleading.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Cloud Service Provider
  Certifications (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance > Industry
  and Sector-Specific Compliance > Cloud and Technology-Specific Compliance > Cloud Service Provider Certifications).


  Incorporate this synthesized research context: CSP certifications (ISO/IEC 27001: ISMS; 27017: cloud security extension;
  27018: cloud PII; SOC 2: Trust Services Criteria for security/privacy; FedRAMP: U.S. gov cloud; CSA STAR: Levels 1-3 registry;
  PCI DSS: payment cloud; NIST CSF: cloud risks; HIPAA/HITECH/GDPR mappings). CSPs: AWS/Azure/GCP hold most. Process: Audits,
  continuous compliance.


  Use these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the full ''learning_objectives'' array here].

  - Scaffolding: [Insert the full ''scaffolding'' object here].

  - Active Learning: Embed concepts from activities into explanations for real-world ties.


  Generate 25 flashcards following the exact schema:
