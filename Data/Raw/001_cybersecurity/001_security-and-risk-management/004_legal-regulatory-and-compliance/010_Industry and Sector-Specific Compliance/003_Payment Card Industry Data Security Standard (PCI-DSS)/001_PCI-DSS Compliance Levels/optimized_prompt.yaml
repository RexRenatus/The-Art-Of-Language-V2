  **Full Research Context (Complete from PCI SSC v4.0+ sources):** PCI-DSS tiers organizations by annual transaction volume.
  Merchants (accept cards): Level 1 (>6M all channels or post-breach: QSA on-site audit, quarterly ASV, ROC/AOC); Level 2
  (1-6M: SAQ B-IP/D, quarterly ASV, AOC); Level 3 (20K-1M e-comm: SAQ P2PE-A/D, quarterly ASV); Level 4 (<20K e-comm or <1M
  total: SAQ A-EP, quarterly ASV per acquirer). Service Providers (process/store for others): Level 1 (>300K: QSA on-site
  audit, quarterly ASV, ROC/AOC); Level 2 (≤300K: SAQ D, quarterly ASV, AOC). Key: CDE scoping, tokenization reduces levels,
  acquirers define exacts.


  **Incorporate:**

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the 6 objectives above].

  - Active Learning: Tie cards to discussion (tier effectiveness), peer teaching (level comparisons), problem-solving (scenarios).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4 (progressive: simple recall → scenarios).

  - Variety: 40% Definition/TF, 40% MCQ, 20% Application.


  Generate 40-50 flashcards following the exact schema. Output as JSON array of card objects. Ensure completeness (all levels
  detailed), accuracy (PCI SSC-based), distractors plausible. End with summary: coverage stats per layer/objective.'
