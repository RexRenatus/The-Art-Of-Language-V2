  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the impact of NIST SP 800-171 Rev 3 changes on small contractors: Does the alignment with NIST
    SP 800-53 Moderate baseline make compliance easier or more burdensome, considering CMMC integration and DFARS reporting
    requirements? Provide pros, cons, and real-world examples from DoD implementations, addressing common misconceptions about
    revisions being minor updates.'
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains core concepts like SSP, POA&M, and ODPs using examples/non-examples of CUI
    (e.g., technical specs as CUI Basic vs. marketing materials as non-CUI), then switch roles to cover CUI categories (Basic
    vs. Specified) and their handling differences. Peers provide feedback on clarity and accuracy to reinforce teach-back.
  problem_solving: 'Present a scenario: A mid-sized DoD contractor handling CUI fails a NIST SP 800-171A assessment with gaps
    in Audit and Accountability (3.3) and System and Communications Protection (3.13). In small groups, identify control gaps,
    prioritize remediation in a POA&M template, propose cost-effective solutions (e.g., open-source tools), and present risk
    reductions.'
