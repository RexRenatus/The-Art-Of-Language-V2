active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges of categorizing a shared cloud-based federal information
    system (e.g., a multi-agency HR platform) under FISMA. How do CIA triad impacts differ from traditional on-premise systems,
    and what trade-offs arise in assigning Low/Moderate/High levels? Reference NIST SP 800-60 mappings and justify your positions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
