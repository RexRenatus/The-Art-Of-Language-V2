        "core_logic": "The System and Information Integrity (SI) control family is critical for maintaining trust in systems because compromised integrity can lead to data corruption, unauthorized modifications, or system failures, undermining operational reliability. These controls function by implementing mechanisms for flaw remediation, error handling, and monitoring for system and information integrity issues.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly assign the core functions of IA, PS, or MA to the SI family, missing its focus on detecting and responding to integrity violations.",
        "analogy": "SI controls act like the 'quality assurance' and 'damage control' systems for your data and systems, ensuring everything is accurate and functioning correctly, and quickly addressing any issues that compromise integrity."
