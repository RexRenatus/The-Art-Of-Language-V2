        "core_logic": "The EAR's 'Know Your Customer' guidance identifies 'red flags' as suspicious circumstances that warrant further investigation. Reluctance to disclose end-use is a key indicator that the transaction might be intended for an unauthorized purpose, thus triggering a duty to inquire further to prevent potential violations.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors describe normal business practices or positive customer attributes, failing to identify suspicious indicators that would trigger an EAR compliance inquiry.",
        "analogy": "If a salesperson is asked to sell a powerful tool, and the buyer refuses to say what they'll use it for, that's a red flag – like a warning light on a car's dashboard."
