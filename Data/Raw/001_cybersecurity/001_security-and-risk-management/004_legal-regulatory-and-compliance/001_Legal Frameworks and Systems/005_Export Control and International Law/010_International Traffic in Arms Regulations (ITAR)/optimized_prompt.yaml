active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the implications of 'deemed exports' in a remote work environment post-COVID.
    How does sharing ITAR technical data via Zoom with international team members violate ITAR, and what mitigations (e.g.,
    VPNs, access controls) align with NIST SP 800-171? Support with real-world examples from defense contractors.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Learning Objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]

  Active Learning Integration: Draw from scenarios/discussions for applied cards.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly:

  - 40-50 cards total.

  - Categorize: 10 Foundation (Layer 1, REMEMBER), 12 Components (Layer 2, UNDERSTAND/ANALYZE), 12 Implementation (Layer 3,
  APPLY), 10 Integration (Layer 4, EVALUATE/CREATE), 6 Mixed/Concept Map.

  - Q&A: 60%, MCQ: 30% (distractors per protocol), Scenarios: 10%.

  - Each card: {''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'':
  ''#'', ''hierarchy_tags'': [''tag1'', ''tag2''], ''source'': ''...''}}

  - Ensure active recall: Use cloze deletions, images/descriptions if textual (e.g., USML table snippet).

  - Plausible distractors: Base on voter-noted misconceptions (ITAR vs. EAR, CUI overlaps).

  - Pedagogical Best Practices: Spaced repetition friendly (atomic facts), Bloom''s progression, scaffolding reinforcement.
