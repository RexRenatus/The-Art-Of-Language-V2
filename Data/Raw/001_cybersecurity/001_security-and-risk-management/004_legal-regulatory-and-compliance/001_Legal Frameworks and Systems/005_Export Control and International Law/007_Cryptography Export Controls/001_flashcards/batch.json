      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The distinction between ECCN 5A002 and 5A992.c is crucial because it differentiates between advanced cryptographic capabilities (5A002) subject to stricter controls and mass-market items (5A992.c) with more liberal export treatment, reflecting a tiered approach to managing cryptographic technology risks. This allows for easier trade in widely available encryption while maintaining oversight on more powerful systems.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractor 1 incorrectly assigns item types. Distractor 2 reverses the control levels. Distractor 3 mischaracterizes the primary basis for differentiation.",
        "analogy": "Think of 5A002 as 'high-security vault' encryption, requiring special permits and checks. 5A992.c is like 'standard home door lock' encryption, widely available and less restricted because it's common and less powerful."
