        "core_logic": "An SBOM is crucial because it enhances transparency and aids in vulnerability management by detailing all software components and their origins, allowing manufacturers and users to track dependencies and potential risks. This works by providing a structured inventory that supports supply chain security and risk assessment.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly define SBOM as a vulnerability list, a source code certification, or a user manual, missing its core function as a software component inventory.",
        "analogy": "An SBOM is like an ingredients list for software; it tells you exactly what components are in the product, helping you understand potential allergens (vulnerabilities) or where the ingredients came from (supply chain)."

        "core_logic": "A 'substantial modification' is significant because it implies the product may no longer meet its original security compliance or intended function, potentially introducing new risks, thus requiring re-evaluation. This works by defining a threshold for changes that necessitate a new conformity assessment, ensuring ongoing security throughout the product's lifecycle.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly define substantial modification as any update, minor fix, or user change, failing to capture the criteria related to compliance impact or alteration of intended purpose.",
        "analogy": "It's like modifying a car's engine significantly after it's sold; if the modification changes its performance or safety compliance, it's a 'substantial modification' requiring re-certification, unlike a simple oil change."
