active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a global cybersecurity team operating across EU (civil law) and U.S. (common law) jurisdictions, debate
    the advantages and challenges of civil law systems for enforcing data privacy regulations like GDPR. Support your position
    with examples of codified statutes versus case precedents and evaluate impacts on incident response.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Legal, Regulatory, and
  Compliance under Security and Risk Management. Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Legal, Regulatory,
  and Compliance > Legal Frameworks and Systems > Categories of Law > Civil Law Systems.


  Civil Law Systems refer to codified legal traditions (e.g., continental Europe, GDPR jurisdictions) relevant to cybersecurity
  compliance, contrasting common law; focus on international risk management, data protection liabilities, not NIST-only.
