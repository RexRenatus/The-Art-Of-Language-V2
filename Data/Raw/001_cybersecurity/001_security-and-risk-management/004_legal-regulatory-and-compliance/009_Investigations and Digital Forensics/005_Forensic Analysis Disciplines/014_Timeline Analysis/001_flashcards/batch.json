      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Relying solely on configuration-based threat detection poses a primary risk because it flags almost any deviation from a baseline, leading to a high volume of false positives. This works by alerting on new processes, files, or network activity without context, which can overwhelm analysts and obscure genuine indicators of compromise, making it harder to build an accurate timeline of actual malicious events.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly claim this method fails to detect changes, is impractical due to configuration, or only detects known signatures, misrepresenting its core risk: generating excessive false positives that hinder accurate timeline analysis.",
        "analogy": "It's like a security alarm that goes off for every leaf blowing past the window, making it hard to notice when a real intruder is trying to break in."
