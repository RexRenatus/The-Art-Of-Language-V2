active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In small groups, debate the trade-offs of live vs. dead forensics in a real-world incident response scenario
    (e.g., ransomware attack on a running server). Consider legal admissibility, data volatility, and chain of custody risks.
    Report back with pros/cons and a consensus recommendation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    vulnerability); 2) Partial truth/opposite (e.g., ''Live forensics preserves original'' vs. risks volatility); 3) Plausible
    unrelated term (e.g., ''Encryption'' instead of ''Hashing''). Ensure distractors are realistic based on forensics pitfalls
    (e.g., SSD issues, anti-forensics).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert cybersecurity educator and flashcard generator specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 25 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Media/Disk Forensics''
  (Category: Cybersecurity; Domain: Security And Risk Management; Subdomain: Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance; Entry: Investigations
  and Digital Forensics; Entry Subdomain: Forensic Analysis Disciplines; Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the 6 objectives above].

  - Scaffolding: Cover Layers 1-4 evenly [reference scaffolding content].

  - Active Learning Hooks: Tie flashcards to discussions (e.g., live/dead debate), peer teaching (e.g., tool demos), problem-solving
  (e.g., mock acquisition).

  - Voter Priorities: NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1 complete (sanitization phases), standards (NIST 800-86/ISO 27037), prior knowledge
  (file systems/hashing), concept map relationships, big picture (legal integrity).

  - Research Context: Definitions (digital forensics, acquisition, hashing MD5/SHA, chain of custody, live/dead); Tools (dd,
  FTK, Autopsy); Challenges (SSD, anti-forensics).


  Flashcard Generation Rules:

  - Balance: 30% Remember/Understand (Layer 1-2), 30% Apply/Analyze (Layer 2-3), 40% Evaluate/Create (Layer 3-4).

  - Types: 40% Short Answer (definitions/processes), 50% MCQ (analysis/comparisons), 10% Fill-in-Blank (steps/tools).

  - Coverage: All objectives, layers, key terms, steps, standards, tools, challenges.

  - Schema: Strictly output JSON array of 25 flashcards matching [flashcard_schema structure above]. No extra text.

  - Quality: Questions active/pedagogical; Answers precise/measurable; Explanations scaffolded with ties to objectives/activities/sources.


  Output ONLY the JSON array, e.g., [{''id'':1, ...}, ...].'
