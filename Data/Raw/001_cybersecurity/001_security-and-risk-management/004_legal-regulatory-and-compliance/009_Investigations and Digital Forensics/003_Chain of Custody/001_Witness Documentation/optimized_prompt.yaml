  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Witness documentation is more critical than technical
    logs for chain of custody in cyber prosecutions.'' Use real-world examples (e.g., Enron or SolarWinds cases) to support
    arguments, focusing on how human testimony bridges technical evidence to legal outcomes.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions (e.g., for fact vs. expert:
    confuse roles like ''fact witnesses give opinions''; overlap with chain of custody like ''witnesses handle physical evidence'').
    Ensure distractors are realistic from voter priorities (e.g., role overlap) and research (e.g., SWGDE confusions).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Witness Documentation''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Level 1: Cybersecurity > Level 2: Security And Risk Management > Level 3: Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance

  pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (objectives provided), active learning (discussion/peer/problem-solving), 4-layer scaffolding
  (foundation to integration), prior knowledge (Chain of Custody, NIST 800-61), big picture (evidence integrity for prosecutions).


  Research Context: Core Concepts - Witness Testimony: Statements on incidents; Fact Witness: Observes facts, no opinions
  (SWGDE.org); Expert Witness: Opinions on technical data (Daubert-qualified); Digital Evidence: Binary data (ITU.int); Chain
  of Custody: Evidence history log; Data Integrity: No unauthorized changes. Standards: NIST SP 800-86 (Guide to Integrating
  Forensic Techniques into Incident Response: Documents witness roles in forensics; https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-86.pdf);
  NIST 800-61 (Incident Handling); SWGDE Best Practices (https://www.swgde.org/).

  (full NIST), pedagogy (assessments), progression. Output ONLY the JSON array.'
