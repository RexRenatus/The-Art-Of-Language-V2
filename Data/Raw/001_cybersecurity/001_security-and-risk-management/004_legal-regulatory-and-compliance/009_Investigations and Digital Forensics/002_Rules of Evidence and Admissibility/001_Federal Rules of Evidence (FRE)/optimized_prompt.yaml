active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a cybersecurity breach investigation like the SolarWinds incident, debate whether automated log files
    from SIEM tools qualify as hearsay under FRE 801-802. Argue for/against admissibility and propose mitigation strategies
    using authentication (FRE 901). Support with real-world examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (2) Related but wrong rule (e.g., mix FRE 401 relevance with 403 prejudice), (3) Partial truth (e.g., ''Hashing verifies
    relevance, not authenticity''). Ensure plausibility from research context/voter suggestions.'

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use for contextual explanations (e.g., reference debate on log hearsay).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM ABOVE].

  - Prior Knowledge: Link to NIST IR, general forensics.

  - Big Picture: FRE mastery enables court-admissible cybersecurity evidence.

  - Best Practices: Hashing (SHA-256), documentation, isolation, chain of custody steps.
