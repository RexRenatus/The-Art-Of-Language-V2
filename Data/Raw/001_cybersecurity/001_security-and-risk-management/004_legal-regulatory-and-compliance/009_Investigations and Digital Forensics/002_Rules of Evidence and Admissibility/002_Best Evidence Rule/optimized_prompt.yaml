active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a cybersecurity breach investigation, the original server log is encrypted by attackers and inaccessible.
    Debate whether a forensic image, system backup, or reconstructed testimony qualifies as 'best evidence,' considering risks
    to integrity, chain of custody, and admissibility in court. Address common misconceptions about digital duplicates being
    equivalent without proper validation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''screenshot'' as best evidence),
    2) Related but incorrect concept (e.g., chain of custody without hash), 3) Edge case exception misused (e.g., testimony
    as primary). Ensure distractors test subtle understanding.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Legal, Regulatory, and
  Compliance topics. Topic: Best Evidence Rule (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Legal, Regulatory,
  and Compliance > Investigations and Digital Forensics > Rules of Evidence and Admissibility > Best Evidence Rule).


  Core Content: Best Evidence Rule (FRE 1002) requires originals for writings/recordings/photographs; in cyber: prioritize
  unaltered data/logs/images with integrity (hashes) and chain of custody. NIST SP 800-53: AU-9, MA-2; NIST CSF: Respond/Protect;
  ISO 27001: A.12.4/A.18.1.

  - Active Learning: Incorporate elements from discussion/peer/problem-solving into scenario cards.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following EXACT schema:

  Front: Question.

  Back: {answer, explanation (cite sources, address misconceptions), blooms_level, scaffolding_layer, related_objective, distractors
  (for MCQs)}.


  Balance: Cover all objectives/layers; 40% MCQs with distractor protocol; vary types. Ensure university-level rigor, active
  recall, spaced repetition optimization. Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}}].


  Prioritize voter consensus: Include phishing scenarios, NIST examples, chain of custody comparisons.'
