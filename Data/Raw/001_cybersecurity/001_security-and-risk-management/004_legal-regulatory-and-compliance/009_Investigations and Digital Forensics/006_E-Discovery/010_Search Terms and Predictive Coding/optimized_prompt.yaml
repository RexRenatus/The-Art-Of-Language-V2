active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue the pros and cons of relying solely on search terms versus TAR for e-discovery
    in high-stakes litigation. Consider factors like FRCP 26(g) certification requirements, cost savings, accuracy risks (e.g.,
    over-culling relevant documents), and judicial precedents. Support arguments with Sedona Conference Principles.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    threats'' instead of document relevance); (2) Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Uses only keywords, no ML'');
    (3) Inverse/extreme (e.g., ''100% accurate, no human review needed''). Ensure plausible for cybersecurity/e-discovery
    novices.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in e-discovery under Security
  and Risk Management > Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance > Investigations and Digital Forensics > E-Discovery > Search Terms
  and Predictive Coding.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema. Ensure accuracy: Focus on LEGAL e-discovery (not threat hunting)—search
  terms cull ESI via keywords; predictive coding = TAR (ML for relevance prediction via training/control sets, recall/precision).
