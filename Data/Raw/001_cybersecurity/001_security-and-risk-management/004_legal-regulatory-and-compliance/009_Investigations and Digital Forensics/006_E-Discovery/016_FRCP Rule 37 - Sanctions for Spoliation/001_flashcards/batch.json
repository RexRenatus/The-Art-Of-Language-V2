        "core_logic": "FRCP Rule 37(e) distinguishes between unintentional loss (potentially leading to (e)(1) sanctions if prejudice occurs) and intentional loss (potentially leading to severe (e)(2) sanctions). Failing 'reasonable steps,' even if unintentional, can result in sanctions if prejudice is demonstrated.",
