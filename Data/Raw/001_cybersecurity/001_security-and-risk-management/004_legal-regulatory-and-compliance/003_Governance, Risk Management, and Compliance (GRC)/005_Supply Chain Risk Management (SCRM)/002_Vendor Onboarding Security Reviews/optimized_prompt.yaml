    - Confuse security with financial/product audits (e.g., ''financial stability'' vs. ''cybersecurity posture'').

    - Mix pre-onboarding VSR with post-onboarding monitoring.

    - Overlap VRM/TPRM/C-SCRM (e.g., ''only ICT hardware'' for C-SCRM).

    - Regulatory errors (e.g., GDPR as financial reg). Ensure distractors are realistic (50% correct-like phrasing).'

  **Full Research Context:**

  Vendor onboarding security reviews (VSR) are a critical part of Vendor Risk Management (VRM), evaluating a vendor''s cybersecurity
  posture before access. VRM identifies/assesses vendor risks; TPRM broadens to all third parties; C-SCRM focuses on ICT supply
  chain risks (NIST SP 800-161). Crucial because: Mitigate attacks (SolarWinds Orion hack exposed 18k orgs); prevent breaches
  (60% via third parties per Verizon DBIR); ensure compliance (GDPR Art.28, HIPAA Business Associates, SOX 404, NIST 800-53
  Rev5 SA-4/-9). Process: Questionnaire (SIG, CAIQ), audits (SOC2 Type II, ISO27001), risk scoring, contracts. Tools: UpGuard,
  Panorays, SecurityScorecard. Sources: upguard.com/blog/vendor-security-review, upguard.com/blog/vendor-risk-management,
