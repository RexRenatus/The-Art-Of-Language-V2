    tool or as an educational guide for users?'' Support your position with examples from real-world breaches caused by human
    error (e.g., phishing incidents) and propose improvements to AUPs in modern remote work environments.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

  **Research Context (Complete Summary):** An AUP outlines rules for IT resource use to protect assets and mitigate human
  error. IT Resources: computers, networks, email, data. Importance/Benefits: Minimizes breaches, ensures GDPR/NIST compliance,
  reduces liabilities/costs, protects IP, fosters security culture. Components: Prohibited activities, responsibilities, enforcement.

  **Pedagogical Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the full ''learning_objectives'' array here].

  - Scaffolding: Use 4 layers – cite layer in cards (e.g., Layer 1: Foundation).

  - Active Learning Tie-in: Cards should prompt recall for discussions (e.g., ''Scenario for peer teach?'').

  - Big Picture: Emphasize AUP in GRC for risk maturity.


  **Generate 30 flashcards (10 Basic, 10 Cloze, 10 MCQ) covering all Bloom''s levels and scaffolding layers proportionally
  (40% lower, 30% middle, 30% higher).**


  **Output Format (JSON Array):** Each card as object: {''type'': ''Basic/Cloze/MCQ'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'',
  ''explanation'': ''... (incl. source, layer, Bloom''s)'', ''distractors'': [''...''] if MCQ}.


  Ensure active recall, no hints on front, web-grounded accuracy, voter-approved depth.'
