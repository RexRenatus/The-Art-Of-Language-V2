      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Continuous Monitoring, as described in NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2, is essential for regulatory change management because it provides ongoing visibility into the effectiveness of controls and compliance status, allowing organizations to adapt to new regulations and threats proactively.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors misrepresent the purpose of continuous monitoring by suggesting it replaces initial authorization, is only reactive, or is limited to technical scanning.",
        "analogy": "Continuous monitoring is like a car's dashboard warning lights; they constantly provide feedback on the vehicle's status, allowing the driver (organization) to address issues proactively and ensure safe, compliant operation, especially when road conditions (regulations/threats) change."
