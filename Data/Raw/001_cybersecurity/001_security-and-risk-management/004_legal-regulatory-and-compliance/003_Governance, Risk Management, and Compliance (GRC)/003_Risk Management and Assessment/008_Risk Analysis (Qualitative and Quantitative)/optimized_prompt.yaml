active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In cybersecurity risk management, when might qualitative analysis be preferable to quantitative, and
    vice versa? Use examples from real breaches like the Equifax data breach (qualitative for rapid prioritization amid uncertainty)
    or Log4j vulnerability (quantitative for modeling widespread exploit probabilities). Consider factors like data availability,
    time constraints, stakeholder needs, and compliance requirements. Argue your position and respond to peers.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Context and Content (Complete and Authoritative):** Use this full topic content, integrating voter priorities (complete
  quantitative with formulas/tools), research (NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1, ISO/IEC 27005:2018, FAIR Institute), and hierarchy:

  - Foundation: Risk, threat, vulnerability, likelihood, impact.

  - Qualitative: Descriptive scales, matrices (likelihood x impact), steps.

  - Quantitative: SLE=Asset Value×EF, ARO, ALE=SLE×ARO; Monte Carlo, decision trees; steps, best practices (data validation,
  simulations).

  - Integration: Hybrids, GRC/compliance links, examples (Equifax qualitative speed; Log4j quantitative modeling).


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Align to Bloom''s (REMEMBER to CREATE) via these objectives: [insert learning_objectives array].
  Use 4-layer scaffolding: [insert scaffolding object]. Incorporate active learning for depth (e.g., reference discussion
  on qual/quant tradeoffs).


  **Generation Rules:**

  - Output 50-75 flashcards, distributed: 12-18 Layer 1, 13-19 Layer 2, 13-19 Layer 3, 12-18 Layer 4.

  - Follow exact schema: [insert flashcard_schema.structure].

  - Distractors: [insert flashcard_schema.distractor_protocol].

  - Explanations: [insert flashcard_schema.explanation_requirements].

  - Optimize for Anki/spaced repetition: Active recall, varied phrasing, images if describable (e.g., ''risk matrix diagram'').

  - Ensure completeness: Cover truncated quantitative (formulas, Monte Carlo examples: simulate ARO variability), sources.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''layer'': ''1'', ''bloom_level'': ''REMEMBER'', ...}]. No extra text.'
