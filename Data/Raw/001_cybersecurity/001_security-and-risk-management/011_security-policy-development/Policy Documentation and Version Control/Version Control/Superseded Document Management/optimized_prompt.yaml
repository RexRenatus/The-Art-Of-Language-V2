  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Simply deleting superseded documents is sufficient for
    cybersecurity compliance.'' Use examples from NIST SP 800-171 to support your position, considering risks like legal retention
    requirements and CUI protection.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    without access controls''). Ensure one is ''attractive'' common error from voter suggestions (e.g., confusing superseded

  **Context (Completed Research):** Managing superseded documents prevents breaches from legacy sensitive info (e.g., CUI).
  NIST SP 800-171 Rev 3: Protects CUI in nonfederal systems (full: access control 3.1, awareness 3.2, audit 3.3, media protection
  3.8 incl. sanitization/destruction, SSP 3.14.4 for documenting protections). NIST 800-53: MP-6 Media Sanitization, AC-20
  Use of External Systems. ISO 27001: A.8.3, A.12.3. Best practices: Archive read-only, log access, retain per legal, sanitize
  before dispose. Big picture: Extends version control to post-replacement security, ensures compliance evolution.


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Use these [LEARNING_OBJECTIVES], [ACTIVE_LEARNING], [SCAFFOLDING_LAYERS]. Objectives progress
  Bloom''s: Remember/Understand → Apply/Analyze → Evaluate/Create. Embed active elements (e.g., ''Apply in problem-solving
  scenario''). Include formative assessments: 2-3 MCQs, 1 short answer per layer with feedback.


  **Task:** Generate 32-48 high-quality flashcards following [FLASHCARD_SCHEMA] exactly. Distribute evenly across 4 scaffolding
  layers. Vary types. Ensure completeness (no truncation), voter priorities (pedagogy, links to prior knowledge). Output as
  JSON array: [{''type'': ''MCQ'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''metadata'': {...}}, ...].


  Prioritize: Measurable verbs, misconceptions, NIST ties, cybersecurity risks.'
