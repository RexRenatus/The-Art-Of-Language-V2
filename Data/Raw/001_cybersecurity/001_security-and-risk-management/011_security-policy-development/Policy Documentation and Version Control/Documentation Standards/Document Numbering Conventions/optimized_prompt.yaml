active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of NIST's SP 800-series numbering convention (e.g., SP 800-53 Rev.
    5) compared to sequential RFC numbering (e.g., RFC 7525) for cybersecurity policy documents. Debate which system better
    supports version control, compliance auditing (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001), and scalability in a multinational organization.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs, create 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions: (1) Confuse prefixes (e.g.,
    SP vs. FIPS); (2) Mix revision styles (Rev. 5 vs. v1.0 vs. date); (3) Organizational vs. standard schemes (SEC-POL vs.
    RFC). Ensure distractors are realistic from research context (e.g., wrong series like 500 vs. 800).'

  - Learning Objectives: [insert the full array from ''learning_objectives'' above].

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert full descriptions from ''scaffolding'' above, including quizzes].

  - Active Learning: [insert full descriptions from ''active_learning'' above].

  - Big Picture: Conventions ensure compliance (SOC 2, ISO 27001), scalable management; examples from NIST SP 800 (e.g., SP
  800-53 Rev. 5), FIPS 140-3, RFC 7525, org schemes (SEC-POL-001 v1.0), COBIT.

  - Sources: NIST.gov/SP-800-series, IETF.org/RFCs, ISO.org/27001.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: [insert full ''flashcard_schema'' above]. Generate 50 flashcards (balanced: 20% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND,
  30% APPLY/ANALYZE, 30% EVALUATE, 20% CREATE; 25% per layer). Cover prior knowledge (file naming), org best practices (prefixes,
  dates), misconceptions.
