      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "NIST SP 800-171r3 Requirement 03.05.03 mandates Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) because it significantly strengthens access security by requiring multiple, independent verification methods. This layered defense makes it much harder for unauthorized individuals to gain access to CUI, even if one factor is compromised.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors confuse MFA with password policies, brute-force protection, or data encryption, failing to recognize that MFA is about combining different categories of authentication evidence (knowledge, possession, inherence).",
        "analogy": "Multi-factor authentication is like needing a key, a security badge, and a fingerprint to enter a high-security area; compromising just one doesn't grant access."
