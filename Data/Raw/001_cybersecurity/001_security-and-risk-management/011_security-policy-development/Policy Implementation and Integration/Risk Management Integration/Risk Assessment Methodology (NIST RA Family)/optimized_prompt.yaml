  discussion_prompt: 'Using the NIST RA methodology (SP 800-30), debate whether organizations overemphasize likelihood over
    impact in risk assessments. Draw on real-world examples like the Equifax breach (2017, where unpatched vulnerability had
    high impact despite moderate likelihood). What misconceptions arise from this imbalance, and how can NIST''s framework
    address them? (Encourage critical thinking: students cite evidence, counterarguments, and propose balanced metrics.)'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Distractor 1: Common confusion (e.g., ''threat'' vs. ''vulnerability'').

    - Distractor 2: Partial truth/overemphasis (e.g., ''likelihood only'' ignoring impact).

    - Distractor 3: Inverse/non-example (e.g., ''benefit'' instead of ''harm'').

    Base on misconceptions: confusing components, ignoring uncertainty, real-world biases (Equifax-like). Ensure plausible,
    derived from NIST docs.'

  Incorporate:

  - Research: NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 (full: Prepare risk assessment; Conduct: identify threat sources/events, vulnerabilities/predisposing
  conditions, likelihood, impact, risk levels w/uncertainty; Communicate results; Maintain assessment). SP 800-37 Rev. 2 (RMF).
  Definitions: Risk (uncertainty effect), Threat (adverse potential), Vulnerability (exploitable weakness), etc.
