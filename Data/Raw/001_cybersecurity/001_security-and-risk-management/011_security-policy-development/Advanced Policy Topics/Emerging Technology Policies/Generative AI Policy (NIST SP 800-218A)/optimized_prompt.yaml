  discussion_prompt: 'Debate: How does NIST SP 800-218A balance innovation in generative AI with security risks from dual-use
    foundation models? Provide examples of high-risk tasks (e.g., cyber operations, evasion of human control) and argue whether
    the SSDF Community Profile sufficiently mitigates them, citing specific practices like PO or PR.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST SP 800-218A: Generative\
  \ AI Policy (Secure Software Development Practices for Generative AI and Dual-Use Foundation Models). Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity\
  \ > Security And Risk Management > Security Policy Development > Advanced Policy Topics > Emerging Technology Policies >\
  \ Generative AI Policy (NIST SP 800-218A).\n\nIncorporate these pedagogical elements:\n- Learning Objectives: [Insert the\
  \ full 'learning_objectives' array here].\n- Active Learning: Use discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving to inspire explanations\
  \ (e.g., tie cards to debate on innovation vs. risks).\n- Scaffolding: Generate cards across 4 layers: [Insert full 'scaffolding_layers'\
  \ here].\n\nGenerate 25 flashcards following this EXACT schema for each:\n{\n  \"question\": \"...\",\n  \"correct_answer\"\
  : \"...\",\n  \"bloom_level\": \"REMEMBER|UNDERSTAND|APPLY|ANALYZE|EVALUATE|CREATE\",\n  \"scaffolding_layer\": \"1|2|3|4\"\
