active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of implementing ZTNA versus traditional VPNs in a hybrid work environment, considering
    cost, user experience, security efficacy, and scalability. Use NIST SP 800-207 to support arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Plausible but incorrect: e.g., for ZTNA definition, distractor ''Relies on perimeter firewalls'' (confuses with legacy).'
    - 'Common misconceptions: e.g., ''ZTNA grants full network access like VPN''.'
    - 'Partial truths: e.g., ''Uses static trust'' vs. continuous verification.'
    - Generate 3 per MCQ; explain why each is wrong, referencing standards.
    variety: 30% definitions (recall), 40% MCQs (understand/apply), 20% scenarios (analyze), 10% open-create (evaluate/create).
