        "core_logic": "GDPR Article 17(2) requires controllers, when personal data has been made public and an erasure request is received, to take 'reasonable steps' to inform other controllers processing the data about the erasure request. This includes informing third parties to whom the data was disclosed, unless doing so is impossible or disproportionately burdensome, ensuring a more complete fulfillment of the right to erasure.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors fail to acknowledge the controller's active duty to inform third parties about erasure requests, suggesting refusal, incomplete erasure, or passive waiting, all of which fall short of GDPR requirements.",
        "analogy": "It's like recalling a product from the market; you don't just stop selling it in your store, you also notify your distributors and retailers to remove it from their shelves."
