active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a resource-limited startup processing user health data, which NIST Privacy Framework Function (e.g.,
    Identify-P vs. Protect-P) should be prioritized first, and why? Debate trade-offs between mitigating privacy risks and
    enabling business innovation, considering legal requirements and data processing ecosystems.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Semantic similarity (e.g., swap similar Functions like Govern-P
    and Control-P); 2) Common misconception (e.g., ''Privacy Risk = data breach only'' vs. full adverse effects); 3) Partial
    truth (e.g., list 4/5 Functions). Ensure plausibility from real-world errors or incomplete Profiles. Balance difficulty:
    40% remember/understand, 30% apply/analyze, 30% evaluate/create.'

  (PT Family) under Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Policy Development > Advanced
  Policy Topics > Privacy and Data Governance > Privacy Policy Framework (NIST PT Family).


  Generate 75 high-quality flashcards optimized for university-level pedagogy using Bloom''s Taxonomy (progress from REMEMBER
  to CREATE), active learning, and 4-layer scaffolding. Incorporate voter consensus (100% approval): explicit objectives,
  active activities, completed Profiles/Tiers, implementation steps, concept map.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list from above].

  **Active Learning:** [Insert full details from above] – tie 20% of cards to these.

  **Scaffolding:** [Insert full layers from above] – tag each card with layer (e.g., #Layer2).

  **Core Content:** NIST Privacy Framework: Voluntary tool for privacy risk management. Key terms: Privacy Risk (likelihood/impact
  of adverse effects from data processing), Data Action (collect/retain/use/etc.), Data Processing (lifecycle), Problematic
  Data Action, Objectives (Predictability/Manageability/Disassociability), Ecosystem. Core: 5 Functions (Identify-P: understand
  risks; Govern-P: governance/policies; Control-P: implement controls; Communicate-P: transparency; Protect-P: protections).
  Profiles: Current/Target (select Subcategories). Tiers: Partial/Repeatable/Defined/Managed/Optimized.
