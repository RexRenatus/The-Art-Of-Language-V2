  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''NIST CSF 2.0 Respond and Recover functions are sufficient
    for all organizations'' crisis management needs, or should ISO 22301 be mandatory for business resilience?'' Support arguments
    with real-world examples like the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack, considering factors like organization size and
    industry.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse IR with full Crisis Management; mix NIST
      RS with RC functions; swap ISO 22301 with NIST SP 800-61).
    - Ensure distractors are 70% similar to correct answer in phrasing/structure for challenge.
    - 'Vary difficulty: Easy (obvious wrong), Medium (partial truth), Hard (contextual trap).'
    - Avoid 'all/none' options; tie to voter priorities like framework comparisons.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Crisis Management Policy
  (Topic Hierarchy: Level 1: Cybersecurity > Level 2: Security And Risk Management > Level 3: Security Policy Development
  > Level 4: Advanced Policy Topics > Level 5: Crisis Management and Business Resilience > Level 6: Crisis Management Policy).
  Voter consensus (82.9% approval) emphasizes completeness (full NIST CSF 2.0: Govern/ID/AM, Protect/PR, Detect/DE, Respond/RS:
  Analysis/AN, Mitigation/MI, Improvements/IM, Recover/RC: Planning, Improvements; add ISO 22301 BCMS, NIST SP 800-61 IR,
  COBIT governance), Bloom''s progression, 4-layer scaffolding, higher-order skills, measurable outcomes, and prior IR links.


  Research Context: Crisis Management Policy outlines strategies for cybersecurity crises (e.g., breaches, ransomware). Integrates
  IR (detection/containment), BC (continuity), DR (restoration). Standards: NIST CSF 2.0 (voluntary framework for resilience,
  expanded RS/RC); ISO 22301 (BCMS certification); COBIT (IT governance); NIST SP 800-61 (IR lifecycle). Sources: NIST.gov/csf,
  iso.org/22301, isaca.org/cobit.

  Generate flashcards per Flashcard Schema [insert schema]. Output as JSON array: [{''id'':1, ''front'': {...}, ''back'':
  {...}, ''bloom_level'':''APPLY'', ''layer'':3}]. Ensure 50+ cards, balanced coverage, distractors as specified. Prioritize
  pedagogy: University-style (active recall, spaced repetition), real-world scenarios, quantifiable (e.g., ''at least 3 functions'').
  No truncation; full framework details.'
