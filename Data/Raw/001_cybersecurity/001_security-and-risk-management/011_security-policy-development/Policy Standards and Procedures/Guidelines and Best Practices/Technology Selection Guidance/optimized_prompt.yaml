active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given budget constraints, debate whether an organization should select a low-cost technology vendor with
    unknown supply chain practices or invest in one vetted via NIST SP 800-161 C-SCRM guidelines. Use NIST CSF outcomes (e.g.,
    Identify, Protect, Detect) to argue pros and cons, considering real-world trade-offs in risk management.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    1. Common misconception (e.g., ''CSF prescribes specific controls'' vs. outcomes).

    2. Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''RMF only for federal systems'' vs. adaptable).

    3. Confusable term/mix-up (e.g., swap C-SCRM with general risk mgmt).

    Ensure distractors test nuance, avoid obvious errors; balance across objectives.'
