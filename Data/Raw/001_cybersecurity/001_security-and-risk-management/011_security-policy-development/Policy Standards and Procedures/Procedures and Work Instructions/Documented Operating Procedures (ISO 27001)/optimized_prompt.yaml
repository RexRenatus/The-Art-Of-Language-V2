active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what ways can poorly documented operating procedures contribute to a cybersecurity breach? Debate
    the balance between detailed procedures and operational flexibility, using ISO 27001 Control A.5.37 as a reference. Share
    examples from recent incidents (e.g., misconfigured cloud access leading to breaches).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives** (span Bloom''s): [insert full array from learning_objectives]. Balance flashcards: 30% Remember/Understand,
  40% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate/Create.

  - **Active Learning**: Draw questions from discussion prompt, peer teaching (e.g., procedure drafting), problem-solving
  (cloud scenario), concept map links.

  - **Scaffolding**: Distribute across 4 layers: [insert full scaffolding]. Tag each flashcard with layer.

  - **Content Sources**: ISO 27001:2022 A.5.37 (document and access procedures); Annex A themes; ISMS/risk management defs;
  Best practices incl. regular reviews (annual/post-incident, approvals, version control); Sources: Advisera, Vanta.
