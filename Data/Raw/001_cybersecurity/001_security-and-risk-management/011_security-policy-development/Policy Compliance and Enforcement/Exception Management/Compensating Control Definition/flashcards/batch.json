        "core_logic": "The risk assessment's role is crucial because it justifies the infeasibility of the primary control and validates the compensating control's effectiveness by demonstrating it addresses the same risk. It functions as the foundation for the decision, ensuring that the compensating measure is a suitable alternative for risk mitigation.",
