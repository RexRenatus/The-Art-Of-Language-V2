        "core_logic": "Because effective assessments require clear boundaries, the preparation step focuses on defining the 'what,' 'when,' and 'why' of the assessment—establishing the objective, scope, and timeframe—to ensure all stakeholders understand the assessment's parameters and goals before it begins.",
