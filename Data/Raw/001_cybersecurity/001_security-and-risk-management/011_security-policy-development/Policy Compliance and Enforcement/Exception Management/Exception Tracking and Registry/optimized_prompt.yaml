active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of granting a cybersecurity exception for a critical legacy
    application unable to support multi-factor authentication. Consider business needs versus risks, referencing NIST CSF
    GV.RM for risk tolerance, and propose compensating controls. Each participant must cite one voter-suggested best practice.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 25 flashcards following the exact schema: {front, back, distractors (array), bloom_level, scaffolding_layer, explanation,
  source}. Balance: 30% Remember/Understand (Layer 1-2), 40% Apply/Analyze (Layer 2-3), 30% Evaluate/Create (Layer 3-4). Incorporate
  best practices (registry fields: ID, justification, risk, expiration; reviews quarterly), example (legacy MFA exception),
  big picture (NIST Govern maturity). Distractors per protocol. Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcard objects, grouped
  by layer.'
