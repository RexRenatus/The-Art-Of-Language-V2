  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one learner explains policy archiving (retrievable storage for audits) versus policy disposal (secure
    permanent deletion), while the partner teaches back with examples from the policy lifecycle; switch roles and discuss
    risks of improper choices.
  problem_solving: Given an outdated BYOD policy from 2015 that no longer aligns with current NIST standards, design a full
    retirement procedure. Include steps for relevance assessment, stakeholder notifications, archiving decisions, and communication
    of changes to avoid security gaps.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ flashcards (prioritize 70% of cards): Generate 3 plausible distractors based on: 1) Common
    misconceptions (e.g., confusing archiving with disposal), 2) Related but incorrect terms (e.g., ''update'' instead of
    ''retire''), 3) Partial truths (e.g., a step out of sequence), 4) Edge cases from NIST/GSA. Ensure distractors are challenging
    for learners at the card''s Bloom''s level but debunkable via explanation.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security and Risk Management.
  Generate 40 high-quality flashcards on ''Policy Retirement Procedures'' (Topic Hierarchy: Level 1: Cybersecurity > Level
  2: Security And Risk Management > Level 3: Security Policy Development > Level 4: Policy Development Lifecycle > Level 5:
  Maintenance and Review > Level 6: Policy Retirement Procedures). Prerequisites: Learners know policy creation, implementation,
  and review.


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert the full ''learning_objectives'' array above]. Distribute flashcards evenly across 6 objectives.

  - Active Learning: [insert the full ''active_learning'' object above]. Reference in 20% of explanations.

  - Scaffolding: [insert the full ''scaffolding'' object above]. Assign ~10 cards per layer (Layer 1: Foundation basic recall;
  Layer 4: advanced evaluation/create).

  - Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (GV.PO: review/update policies), GSA IT Security Procedural Guide (policy maintenance, archiving/disposal),
  ISO 27001 policy mgmt. Steps: Assess relevance, notify stakeholders, approve, archive/dispose, update repo, communicate.


  Use exact ''flashcard_schema'' format. Mix types: 70% MCQ (w/ 3 distractors), 15% cloze, 15% Q&A. Ensure variety, progression
  from low to high Bloom''s. Cover voter priorities: completeness (full steps/sources), pedagogy (Bloom''s/active), real-world
  cases (BYOD, breaches). Output ONLY a JSON array of 40 flashcards, valid and parseable.'
