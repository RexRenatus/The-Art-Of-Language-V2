        "core_logic": "Defining authorization boundaries is crucial for scope because it clearly delineates the systems and assets under an authorizing official's responsibility and risk acceptance, as per NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2 (CA-6). This boundary clarifies management oversight and accountability, because it establishes a defined perimeter for security and privacy governance, ensuring that risk is managed within defined limits.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly link boundaries to physical security, data limitations, or automatic control assignment, missing their core function of defining management responsibility and risk acceptance scope.",
        "analogy": "An authorization boundary is like the jurisdiction of a police department; it defines the specific geographical or functional area for which that department is responsible for security and law enforcement."
