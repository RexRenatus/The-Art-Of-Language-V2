active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how SoD contributes to zero-trust architectures and its role in reducing
    insider threats. Use real-world examples like the Enron scandal (SoD failure) versus effective implementations in banks.
    Link to prior concepts like Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (30% of cards): Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g., for
    SoD definition: ''Single user efficiency'' instead of multi-role checks). Ensure 1 from related concept (e.g., PoLP confusion),
    1 regulatory misquote, 1 real-world violation example twisted positively. Distractors must be realistic to test analysis.'

  Use this optimized content (synthesized from NIST, SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, CIS Controls, voter consensus, and web research)
  to generate high-quality flashcards:


  **Prior Knowledge:** PoLP, RBAC, governance basics.

  **Big Picture:** SoD enables compliance, reduces risk/insider threats, supports zero-trust in Security domain.

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full scaffolding from above JSON].

  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list from above JSON].

  **Active Learning Integration:** Draw from discussion/peer/problem-solving for scenario-based cards.

  **Real-world:** Examples (Enron fraud, Wells Fargo, HIPAA PHI breaches); Violations/case studies.

  **Standards (Complete):** NIST SP 800-53 AC-5; SOX §404; HIPAA §164.312(a)(2)(i) (SoD for PHI: separate authorize/access/review);
  PCI-DSS Req 7; Sources: nist.gov/sp800-53, hhs.gov/hipaa, pcisecuritystandards.org.


  **Output 75 flashcards in JSON array:** Each as {"front": "...", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "hints":
  ["..."]}, "metadata": {"bloom_level": "...", "layer": #, "type": "...", "source": "..."}}.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly [Insert full schema from above JSON]. Ensure active recall, spaced repetition friendly,
  no hints on front. Cover all Bloom''s levels progressively, voter priorities (e.g., pedagogy, completeness), and scaffold
  layers. Make explanations pedagogical with transitions/summaries.'
