active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate whether a RACI matrix should strictly have only one Accountable (A) per task in high-stakes security
    governance or if exceptions (e.g., shared accountability in joint ventures) are justifiable. Reference the NIST CSF Govern
    function and discuss risks like diffusion of responsibility. Students must support arguments with examples from security
    policy development.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Multiple A''s allowed; 3) C as optional (vs. required input); 4) I as two-way comms; 5) Security-specific errors (e.g.,
    CISO as only R). Ensure distractors are plausible from voter-noted pitfalls or standards (NIST single A emphasis). Limit
    to 20-30% trickiness to avoid frustration.'
