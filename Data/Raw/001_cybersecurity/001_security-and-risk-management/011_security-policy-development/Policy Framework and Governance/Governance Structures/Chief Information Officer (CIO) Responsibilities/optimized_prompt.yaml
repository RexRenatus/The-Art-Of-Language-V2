active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''The CIO should directly manage day-to-day cybersecurity
    operations rather than delegating to a CISO.'' Use examples from NIST frameworks and GSA guidelines to support your position,
    considering governance structures and risk integration.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:\
  \ Chief Information Officer (CIO) Responsibilities (Hierarchy: Level 1 Cybersecurity → Level 2 Security And Risk Management\
  \ → Level 3 Security Policy Development → Level 4 Policy Framework and Governance → Level 5 Governance Structures → Level\
  \ 6 CIO Responsibilities). Use this synthesized content:\n\n**Core Concepts:** Cybersecurity (protecting systems/networks\
  \ from attacks - Hyperproof); Cybersecurity Risk (negative IT outcomes from CIA loss - GSA/Hyperproof); Risk Management\
  \ (assess/respond/monitor risks - GSA); ERM (holistic risk integration).\n\n**CIO Responsibilities (Completed/Expanded):**\
  \ Strategic oversight of cybersecurity programs; Develop risk management strategies (establish context, assess, respond,\
  \ monitor); Integrate cybersecurity with ERM; Ensure compliance (NIST CSF, GSA RMS); Report risks to executives/board; Foster\
  \ security culture (training/awareness); Govern policy frameworks; Collaborate with CISO (CIO strategic, CISO tactical).\n\
  \n**Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full scaffolding from above].\n\n**Learning Objectives:** [Insert full objectives from\
  \ above].\n\n**Voter Consensus (68.6% approval):** Emphasize completeness (full risk integration), pedagogy (Bloom's progression),\
  \ misconceptions (CIO vs CISO).\n\nGenerate 40-50 high-quality flashcards following this EXACT schema:\n```json\n[\n  {\n\
  \    \"front\": \"Question text (Bloom: LEVEL | Layer: #)\",\n    \"back\": {\n      \"answer\": \"Correct answer\",\n \

  \ confusion, tactical tasks). Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, progressive complexity.\
