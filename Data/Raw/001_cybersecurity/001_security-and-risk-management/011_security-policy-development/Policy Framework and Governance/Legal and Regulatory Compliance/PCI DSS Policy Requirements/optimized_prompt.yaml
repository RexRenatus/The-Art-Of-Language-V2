active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges of maintaining PCI DSS compliance in a small e-commerce
    business versus a large financial institution. Consider factors like CDE scope, cost of implementation, and integration
    with existing security policies. Support arguments with references to the 12 PCI DSS requirements.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Plausible but incomplete (e.g., CHD definition missing PAN).
    - Common misconceptions (e.g., SAD can be stored if encrypted – false).
    - Confuse similar terms (e.g., CHD vs. SAD).
    - Out-of-scope elements (e.g., non-CDE systems).
    - Partial truths from adjacent requirements (e.g., mix Req 1 firewall with Req 6 patching).
    - Generate 3 per MCQ, ensure balanced difficulty.
