      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The primary objective of encrypting data at rest is to prevent unauthorized disclosure because encryption renders stored data unreadable without the correct decryption key, functioning through cryptographic scrambling to protect confidentiality, as emphasized in NIST guidelines like SP 800-171r3.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractor 1 relates to availability. Distractor 2 relates to performance. Distractor 3 relates to data integrity, which is a separate security goal.",
        "analogy": "Encrypting data at rest is like putting your valuables in a locked safe; its main purpose is to keep them secret (confidential) from anyone who might break into your house, not to make them easier to find (availability) or prevent them from being tampered with inside the safe (integrity)."
