active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: 'In pairs, one learner explains NIST SP 800-88 sanitization methods (Clear: overwrite; Purge: degauss/encrypt
    erase; Destroy: physical shredding) with examples/non-examples (e.g., ''Delete'' is not sanitization), then switch roles
    for teach-back verification.'
  problem_solving: In groups, design a data protection policy for a fictional healthcare company handling PHI on removable
    media. Apply CIA Triad protections, NIST CSF Govern/Protect functions, and step-by-step sanitization protocols; present
    and peer-review for compliance gaps.

  distractor_protocol: Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Formatting sanitizes
    media' vs. 'Overwriting per NIST Clear'; 'Delete recovers data' vs. 'Purge makes irretrievable'; mix media types or CIA
    elements). Ensure distractors are 70% correct-sounding but wrong (e.g., valid for low-security but not high-security).
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Removable Media Controls
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Policy Development > Policy Content and Types
  > Data Protection Policies > Removable Media Controls). Synthesize comprehensive, accurate content from: NIST SP 800-88
  Rev. 1 (2014) / draft Rev. 2 (target 2025), NCSC Removable Media Guidance (Profile 3: encrypt, scan, log, disable autorun),
  ISO 27001/27002:2022 (A.8.2.3 media handling), NIST CSF 2.0 (Govern/ID/Protect), research context (removable media risks
  to CIA, ICS/OT constraints, Stuxnet examples).


  Big Picture: Essential data protection control in enterprise risk management/CISSP domain; builds on CIA Triad prerequisites.


  Concept Map: Central ''Removable Media Controls'' → CIA Triad (threats) → Sanitization Methods (Clear/Purge/Destroy) → Standards
  (NIST/NCSC/ISO) → Policy (implementation/integration) → CSF Functions.
