active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of 'shifting security left' in SSDLC (integrating security
    early) versus traditional SDLC bolt-on security. Use real-world examples from tech firms like Microsoft SDL and reference
    NIST SSDF groups to support arguments, then vote on the most compelling point.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
