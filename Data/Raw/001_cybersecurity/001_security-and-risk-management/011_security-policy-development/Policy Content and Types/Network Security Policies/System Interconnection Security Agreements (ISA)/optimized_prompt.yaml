active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a scenario where a healthcare provider and a cloud service provider plan to interconnect systems,
    debate whether an ISA is redundant if they already have an MOU and strong firewalls. Identify potential risks (e.g., CIA
    impacts) and responsibilities each party should define in the ISA. This encourages critical thinking on policy vs. technical
    controls.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Distractors must be: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''ISA is same as MOU'' instead of security-specific);
    2) Partial truths (e.g., lists only 2/3 CIA elements); 3) Plausible alternatives (e.g., wrong NIST doc like SP 800-53);
    4) Edge cases (e.g., technical controls only, ignoring responsibilities). Ensure 1 best answer, no overlaps. For non-MCQ,
    use open-ended with rubrics in explanation.'

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full array from ''learning_objectives'']

  - Scaffolding: Foundation (definitions/CIA), Components (ISA structure vs MOU), Implementation (NIST SP 800-47 steps), Integration
  (RMF/cloud).

  - Active Learning: Use discussion/peer/problem-solving for context in explanations.

  - Big Picture: ISAs for federal/cloud interconnects ensuring CIA/adequate security.
