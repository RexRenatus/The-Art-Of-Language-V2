active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between signature-based, anomaly-based, and stateful protocol analysis detection
    methods in an IPS policy. In what scenarios would each be most appropriate, considering false positives/negatives, performance
    impact, and unknown threats? Address common misconceptions like over-relying on signatures for zero-day attacks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: (1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''IPS is passive
    like IDS''), (2) Partial truths (e.g., ''Signatures detect all threats''), (3) Confusions with related concepts (e.g.,
    firewall rules vs. IPS tuning), (4) Extremes (e.g., ''Zero false positives possible''). Ensure distractors promote critical
    thinking.'

  Incorporate this research-grounded content:

  - IPS: Proactively detects/prevents incidents via signature-based (known threats, low false negatives but misses unknowns),
  anomaly-based (unknown threats, high false positives), stateful protocol analysis (protocol deviations).

  - NIST SP 800-94 (2007): Key guide for IDPS deployment, management, tuning; covers detection methods, policy components
  (scope, roles, config, monitoring), steps (risk assess, test, tune).

  - Policy components: Scope, responsibilities, standards, procedures, integration (SIEM, IR).

  - Prerequisites: Firewalls, network protocols, general policies.

  - Sources: NIST SP 800-94 Rev.1 (2007), NIST SP 800-53 (controls), CIS Controls v8 (IDS/IPS), ISO 27001 Annex A.12.4.

  - Scaffolding: Generate cards across 4 layers [insert full scaffolding from JSON].

  - Active Learning: Draw from discussion (detection trade-offs), peer teaching (methods), problem-solving (financial firm
  false positives).


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards following this exact schema [insert full flashcard_schema from JSON]. Ensure spaced
  repetition optimization: Varied formats, progressive difficulty (Bloom''s REMEMBER to CREATE), distractors per protocol.
  Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': 1-4, ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...''}].
