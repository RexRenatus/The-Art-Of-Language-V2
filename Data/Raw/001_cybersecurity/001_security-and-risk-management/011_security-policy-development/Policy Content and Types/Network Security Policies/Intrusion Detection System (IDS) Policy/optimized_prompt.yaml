    verbs:

    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast signature-based and anomaly-based detection in IDPS. In a resource-constrained environment
    like a small business network, which would you prioritize and why? Debate the trade-offs in false positives versus detection
    of zero-day attacks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
  additional_activities:
  - 'Think-Pair-Share: Address misconceptions (e.g., IDS prevents vs. detects intrusions).'
  - 'Role-Playing: Simulate an intrusion alert response as a security team.'
  - 'Case Study: Analyze the Equifax breach and discuss how a robust IDS policy could mitigate it, contrasting with firewall-only
    setups.'

    Ensure distractors test nuance from research context and voter priorities.'
