  discussion_prompt: 'Debate in groups: In what scenarios is DAC preferable to MAC (e.g., flexible small teams vs. rigid high-security
    environments like military)? Consider trade-offs between flexibility/user control and risks like over-permissive access,
    privilege escalation, or Trojan horse attacks. Support arguments with real-world examples.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    ''Labels'' for MAC), 2) Over-generalizations (e.g., ''Owner only'' ignoring groups), 3) Partial truths (e.g., ''Central
    admin'' for DAC''s decentralized nature). Ensure distractors teach by contrast (e.g., highlight DAC flexibility vs. MAC
    rigidity).'
