active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between conducting quarterly access reviews (high security, aligns with NIST CSF
    Govern function and HIPAA safeguards) versus semi-annual reviews (cost-effective for resource-limited mid-sized enterprises)
    in a mid-sized enterprise handling sensitive data. Support arguments with references to NIST CSF, HIPAA, SOX, and real-world
    risk factors like insider threats.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs: 3 plausible distractors. Make them common misconceptions (e.g., for ''frequency'': ''Daily''
    (too frequent), ''Never'' (non-compliant), ''Ad-hoc only'' (lacks structure)). Base on real errors (e.g., confuse recertification
    with provisioning). Ensure 1-2 distractors are ''almost correct'' to test deeper understanding. No ''all/none'' traps.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Access Review and Recertification
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Policy Development > Policy Content and Types
  > Access Control Policies > Access Review and Recertification). Use the provided research context, complete standards (e.g.,
  SOX Section 404 mandates access controls for financial reporting integrity; add PCI-DSS Req. 7, GDPR Art. 25/32, CIS Control
  5), sources (NIST CSF 2.0: https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework; HIPAA: 45 CFR §164.308; SOX: Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002; PCI-DSS
  v4.0; GDPR; CIS Controls v8), prior knowledge (RBAC/least privilege), and concept map (Central: Access Review & Recertification
  → Least Privilege, IAM, Standards, Processes).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full array above]

  - Active Learning: Use for scenario inspiration (e.g., debate frequency, peer-teach standards).

  - Scaffolding: 4 layers [insert full scaffolding above]; tag each card.


  Generate flashcards per schema: [insert full schema above]. Ensure university-level rigor: active recall, spaced repetition
  friendly, higher Bloom''s emphasis. Cover voter priorities: completeness (full SOX: post-Enron law for accurate financials
  via access controls), integration. Output ONLY the JSON array of 50 flashcards.'
