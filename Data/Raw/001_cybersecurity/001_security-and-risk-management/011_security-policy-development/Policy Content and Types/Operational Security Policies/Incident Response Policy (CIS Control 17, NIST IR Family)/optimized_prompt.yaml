active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether CIS Control 17 or NIST SP 800-61r3 provides a more actionable framework
    for developing an Incident Response Policy in a resource-constrained SMB. Use real-world examples like the 2021 Colonial
    Pipeline ransomware attack to support your position, considering factors like implementation cost, scalability, and recovery
    speed.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards\
  \ for 'Incident Response Policy (CIS Control 17, NIST IR Family)' in Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security\
  \ Policy Development > Policy Content and Types > Operational Security Policies.\n\n**Context:** Use provided scaffolding\
  \ layers, learning objectives, active learning activities, and research (NIST SP 800-61r3 full lifecycle: Preparation, Detection\
  \ & Analysis, Containment/Eradication/Recovery, Post-Incident Activity; CIS Control 17: IR program/plan with logging). Sources:\
  \ NIST SP 800-61r3, CIS Controls v8, Cynet IR Guide.\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. Generate 40-60 cards distributed across 4\
  \ scaffolding layers (10-15 each). Ensure progression: Layer 1 basic recall, Layer 4 synthesis.\n2. Align to Bloom's objectives:\
  \ Mix REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND (Layer 1-2), APPLY/ANALYZE (Layer 3), EVALUATE/CREATE (Layer 4).\n3. Incorporate active learning:\
  \ Reference discussion (CIS vs NIST debate), peer teaching (CSIRT roles), problem-solving (phishing scenario) in explanations.\n\
  4. Follow exact schema: 50% cloze, 30% Q&A, 20% MCQ with distractors. Tag: [Layer X] [Bloom: Level].\n5. Ensure completeness:\
  \ Cover truncated NIST (recommendations for lifecycle, policy elements); connections to CIA triad, risk mgmt.\n\n**Output\
  \ Format (JSON array of objects):**\n[\n  {\n    \"front\": \"Question/cloze\",\n    \"back\": \"Answer\",\n    \"explanation\"\
