  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full list above].

  - Prior Knowledge: Links to risk assessment and incident response.

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste full layers above, including concept map and NIST CSF completion].

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to discussions, peer teaching, problem-solving.

  - Big Picture: BCP''s role in NIST CSF Recover, ISO 22301, cybersecurity maturity, resilience vs. cyber-physical threats.

  - Research Context: Use definitions (BC, BCP, cybersecurity, disruptive incident, resilience); intertwined cyber-BC nature.


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (aim for even distribution across Bloom''s levels and layers). Output ONLY a JSON array
  of flashcards matching the schema: {''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'':
  [...]}}. Ensure questions are active, measurable, and scaffolded (Layer 1 simple, Layer 4 complex). Distractors per protocol.
  Explanations reference objectives/layers/standards explicitly for spaced repetition best practices.'
