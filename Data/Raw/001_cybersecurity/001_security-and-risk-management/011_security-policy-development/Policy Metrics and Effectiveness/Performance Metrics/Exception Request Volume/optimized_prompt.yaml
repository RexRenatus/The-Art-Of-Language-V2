  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of allowing high exception request volumes: Does it foster
    business agility or signal policy failure? Use NIST CSF GV.OC and GV.RM to support arguments, and propose metrics for
    ''acceptable'' volume.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    incident volume vs. exception); (2) Misapply NIST refs (e.g., GV.PO as ''IDENTIFY''); (3) Use real but incorrect values/thresholds
    from sources; (4) Partial truths (e.g., ''high volume always good for agility''). Ensure 1-2 highly tempting distractors
    per card.'
