        "core_logic": "Risk monitoring, as described in NIST SP 800-30 and SP 800-39, is the continuous process of maintaining awareness of the risk environment and the effectiveness of risk management activities. Because the threat landscape and organizational systems constantly change, ongoing monitoring is essential to identify new risks, track changes, and ensure that risk responses remain effective. Therefore, it supports informed, timely risk-based decisions.",

Therefore, it empowers organizations to tailor their approach based on unique risks, missions, and resources, rather than mandating specific methods.",
