        "core_logic": "Risk Mitigation (CC9) requires organizations to implement strategies to address identified risks, which can include reducing their likelihood or impact, or transferring them. Because effective risk management is crucial for protecting systems and data, this criterion ensures that identified threats are actively managed rather than ignored.",
