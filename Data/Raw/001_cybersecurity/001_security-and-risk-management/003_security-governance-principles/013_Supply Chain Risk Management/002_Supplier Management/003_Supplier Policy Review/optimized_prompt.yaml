  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the following: ''Given real-world incidents like the SolarWinds supply
    chain attack, should organizations prioritize NIST SP 800-161r1 over ISO/IEC 27001 for supplier policy reviews, or integrate
    both? Provide evidence from the standards and evaluate trade-offs in implementation.'' Encourage critical thinking by
    requiring participants to reference Bloom''s higher levels (analyze/evaluate).'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
