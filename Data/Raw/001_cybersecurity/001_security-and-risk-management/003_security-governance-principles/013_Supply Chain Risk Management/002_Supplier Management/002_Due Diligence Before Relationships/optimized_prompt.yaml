active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of the SolarWinds supply chain attack, debate the trade-offs between comprehensive pre-relationship
    due diligence and the pressure for rapid supplier onboarding. How does this align with NIST SP 1326 and regulatory requirements
    like ISO 27001? Support your position with evidence from real-world breaches (e.g., Target's HVAC vendor).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    but wrong concept (e.g., VRM vs. C-SCRM), (3) Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., ''always requires full audit''). Ensure
    plausible for cybersecurity novices.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Supply Chain Risk Management.
  Topic: ''Due Diligence Before Relationships'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Governance
  Principles > Supply Chain Risk Management > Supplier Management > Due Diligence Before Relationships).


  Incorporate these exactly:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the array above]

  - Active Learning: Use for scenario cards.

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste the object above] – Distribute cards across layers.

  - Voter Consensus: 100% approval; emphasize NIST SP 1326 completion (Quick-Start Guide steps), case studies (SolarWinds,
  Target, Colonial Pipeline), misconceptions.

  - Research Context: Due diligence is pre-relationship investigation; contrasts VRM (ongoing). Prioritize third-party breach
  prevention.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards in JSON array format: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {full schema as above}}].


  Best Practices: University pedagogy (Bloom''s progression), active recall, spaced repetition. Questions test deep understanding.
  Distractors per protocol. Every back includes explanation tying to objectives/layers/real-world. Output ONLY the JSON array
  – no extra text.'
