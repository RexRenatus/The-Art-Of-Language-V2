active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Using the SolarWinds hack as a case study, debate whether continuous monitoring tools like automated
    vulnerability scanners are sufficient for ongoing supplier risk management, or if human intelligence and relationship-building
    are equally critical. What trade-offs exist in terms of cost, scalability, and effectiveness? (Encourages critical thinking,
    evaluation, and peer debate.)
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
