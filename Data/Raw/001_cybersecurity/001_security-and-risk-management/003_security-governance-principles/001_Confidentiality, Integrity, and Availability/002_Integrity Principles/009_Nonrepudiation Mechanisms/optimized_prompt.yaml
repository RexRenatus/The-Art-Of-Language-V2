active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the role of nonrepudiation mechanisms in Security Governance Principles
    for risk management and trust-building. How do they contribute to compliance with regulations like GDPR (Article 32) and
    SOX Section 404? Provide real-world examples, such as email disputes resolved via S/MIME signatures, and counterarguments
    for scenarios where nonrepudiation might fail (e.g., key compromise). Synthesize key takeaways as a class mind map.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Distractor 2: Related but incorrect mechanism (e.g., ''hashing alone'' vs. signature).

    - Distractor 3: Partial truth/exaggeration (e.g., ''only for physical evidence''). Ensure distractors test subtle differences,
    avoid ''all/none'' options.'
