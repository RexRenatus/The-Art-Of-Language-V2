active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the implications of failing truthfulness validation in high-stakes scenarios
    like election interference via deepfakes or tampered financial logs. What governance failures enable this, and how does
    NIST CSF address them? Support with evidence from frameworks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Research Context (Complete Summary):**

  Truthfulness validation ensures accuracy, integrity, and trustworthiness of data/comms in cybersecurity. Core concepts:
  Truthfulness (accurate, non-deceptive info), Validation (confirmation process), Integrity (unaltered data), Authenticity
  (genuine source), Trustworthiness (reliability).

  NIST CSF 2.0 supports via:

  - **Govern (GV):** Establishes cybersecurity risk management strategy, governance, policies (e.g., GV.OC-01: Organizational
  context; GV.RM-01: Risk management). Completes oversight for truthfulness policies.

  - **Identify (ID):** Assets, risks, vulnerabilities (e.g., ID.AM-01: Asset management).

  - **Protect (PR):** Integrity controls like access control, data security (e.g., PR.DS-03: Data integrity via hashing/signatures;
  PR.AC-01).

  - **Detect (DE):** Anomalies in data/logs (e.g., DE.AE-01: Anomalies/events).

  - **Respond (RS):** Integrity breach handling (e.g., RS.MI-01: Mitigation).

  - **Recover (RC):** Restore trustworthy state (e.g., RC.RP-01: Recovery plan).

  Implementation: 1. Hashing/checksums; 2. Digital signatures; 3. SIEM logs; 4. Audits. Advanced: AI deepfake detection, zero-trust.
