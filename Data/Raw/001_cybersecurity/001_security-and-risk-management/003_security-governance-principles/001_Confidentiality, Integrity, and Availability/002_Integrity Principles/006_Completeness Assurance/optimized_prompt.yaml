  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Completeness assurance is more critical than individual
    control effectiveness in achieving trustworthy cybersecurity governance.'' Support your position with references to NIST
    frameworks and real-world breaches where completeness gaps led to failures (e.g., SolarWinds). Identify 2-3 counterarguments
    and rebuttals.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    completeness with ''accuracy''; mix NIST SP 800-53 with CSF 1.1; overlook CIA integrity link). Ensure 1 distractor is
    a near-miss (e.g., partial definition), 1 overly narrow, 1 unrelated framework (e.g., ISO 27001). Distractors must be
    verifiable from sources.'

  **Context**: Completeness assurance ensures confidence that all security/privacy requirements are identified and addressed
  for trustworthiness (NIST). Core: Completeness (exhaustive coverage), Assurance (effectiveness confidence), Trustworthiness
  (reliability/resilience/security). Sources: NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r5), CSF 2.0 Govern
  (https://www.nist.gov/itl/smallbusinesscybersecurity/cybersecurity-framework/cybersecurity-framework-20).


  **Pedagogy Integration**:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the 6 objectives above].

  - Scaffolding: Use 4 layers [Insert scaffolding details].

  - Active Learning: Inspire cards with discussion/peer/problem-solving hooks.

  - Big Picture: Ensures governance achieves ''sufficient trustworthiness'' via risk mgmt.

  - Concept Map: Central: Completeness Assurance → Completeness/Assurance/Trustworthiness → NIST CSF/SP 800-53 → CIA/Integrity
  prereqs → Risk Mgmt/Audits.
