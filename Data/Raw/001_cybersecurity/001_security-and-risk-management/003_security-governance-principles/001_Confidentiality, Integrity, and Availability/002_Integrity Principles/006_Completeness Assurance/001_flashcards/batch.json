      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Supply Chain Risk Management (SR) is vital for completeness assurance because it addresses risks originating from external sources (suppliers), ensuring that the entire lifecycle of acquired systems and services, from development to disposal, is secured, thus completing the security picture.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors misrepresent SCRM by limiting its scope to finance, mandating open-source, or excluding software/services, ignoring its comprehensive approach to supply chain security.",
        "analogy": "SCRM's role in completeness is like inspecting all the ingredients and their sources before baking a cake; it ensures nothing harmful or substandard enters the process, making the final product (system) more complete and secure."

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Failing to tailor controls based on a specific risk assessment undermines completeness because it assumes generic controls are sufficient, potentially leaving unique organizational risks unaddressed, thus creating critical gaps in the security posture.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly assume generic controls are inherently sufficient, misapply the scope of completeness, or confuse a lack of relevant controls with an excess of generic ones.",
        "analogy": "Implementing generic controls without a tailored risk assessment is like buying a standard toolkit without knowing the specific repairs needed for your car; you might have tools, but you likely won't have the exact ones required, leaving the job incomplete."
