active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios might strict Separation of Duties hinder operational efficiency (e.g., slowing financial
    transactions or software deployment pipelines), and how can organizations balance security with productivity? Debate pros/cons
    using real-world examples and propose hybrid solutions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (4 options, 1 correct): Distractors are plausible misconceptions from research/voters, e.g.,
    ''Confuse SoD with single-person control'', ''Mix PoLP as identical to SoD'', ''Overstate speed benefits'', ''Ignore collusion
    risks''. Ensure 1-2 highly plausible (e.g., related concepts like PoLP), 1 common error (e.g., CIA focus wrong), 1 absurd.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Separation of Duties (SoD)
  under topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Governance Principles > Confidentiality,
  Integrity, and Availability > Additional Security Concepts > Separation of Duties.


  Incorporate this research summary: SoD prevents fraud/errors by dividing critical tasks (no single control). Key concepts:
  Segregation of Duties, Four Eyes Principle, TPI, PoLP (complementary). Purpose: Fraud prevention, accountability, Integrity
  protection (CIA link). Examples: Workflows, Enron violations. NIST CSF: PR.AC-4/PR.AA integration.


  Use these LEARNING OBJECTIVES (span Bloom''s): [insert array above].

  SCAFFOLDING LAYERS: [insert layers above] – cards must cover progressively.

  ACTIVE LEARNING: Weave in hooks from [discussion/peer/problem-solving above] for application.


  Generate flashcards PER EXACT FLASHCARD SCHEMA above. Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition, higher-order
  (50% Apply+). Balance: 10 cards/Layer, hit all objectives. Varied types for engagement. Output ONLY valid JSON array of
  flashcards, no extra text.'
