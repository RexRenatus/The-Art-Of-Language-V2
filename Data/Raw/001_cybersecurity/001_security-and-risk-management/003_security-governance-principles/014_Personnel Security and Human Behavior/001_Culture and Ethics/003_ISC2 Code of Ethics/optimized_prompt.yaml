  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list from above]. Cover all Bloom''s levels evenly.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards: 6 Layer 1 (foundation), 6 Layer 2 (components), 7 Layer 3 (implementation), 6 Layer 4 (integration).

  - Active Learning Tie-Ins: 5 cards as scenario-based (e.g., discussion/peer teach prompts miniaturized).

  - Concept Map: Ensure cards reference hierarchy (e.g., ''Canon 1 links to Security Governance'').


  **Output Format (Strict JSON Array):** Each card as object: {"id":1, "type":"MC|Recall|Application", "front":"full question",
  "back":{"answer":"...", "explanation":"detailed, 2-4 sentences, verbatim canon quotes, Bloom''s level, layer, tags: [''hierarchy-level6'',
