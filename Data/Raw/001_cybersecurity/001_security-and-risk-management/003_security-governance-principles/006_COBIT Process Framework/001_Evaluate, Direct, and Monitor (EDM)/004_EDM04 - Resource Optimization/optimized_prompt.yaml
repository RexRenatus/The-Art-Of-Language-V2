active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of over-allocating resources to compliance-driven cybersecurity
    tools versus risk-prioritized threat hunting under EDM04 constraints. Use real-world examples like the Equifax breach
    to support arguments on value maximization.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
