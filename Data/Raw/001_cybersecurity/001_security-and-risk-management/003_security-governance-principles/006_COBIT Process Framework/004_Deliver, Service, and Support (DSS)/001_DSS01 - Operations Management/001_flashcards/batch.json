        "core_logic": "The Information Security Program Plan (PM-1) provides a strategic overview because it functions by outlining the program's requirements, management controls, common controls, and responsibilities. This plan guides the overall security program, connecting to risk management strategy and resource allocation (PM-3), ensuring a cohesive approach.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors describe elements that belong to lower-level documentation (system plans, inventories, IR procedures) rather than the high-level overview required for an organization-wide program plan.",
        "analogy": "An Information Security Program Plan is like a company's strategic business plan; it outlines the overall goals, structure, and key responsibilities, not the detailed operational procedures for each department."
