active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a cybersecurity firm implementing a new zero-trust architecture, what are the top three sources of
    employee resistance, and how can BAI05 principles mitigate them? Debate in pairs and share with the class.
  peer_teaching: Students pair up; one explains COBIT BAI05 core concepts (e.g., OCE vs. traditional change management, key
    practices) while the partner takes notes and asks clarifying questions, then switch roles.
  problem_solving: Present a case study of a hospital adopting NIST CSF updates. Groups identify change enablement gaps using
    BAI05, propose a step-by-step enablement plan, and define metrics for adoption success.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ flashcards (30% of total): Generate 4 options (1 correct, 3 distractors). Distractors must
    be plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse BAI05 with BAI06; mix up NIST CSF functions; oversimplify resistance
    sources). Ensure distractors test nuance (e.g., ''fear of job loss'' vs. actual BAI05 mitigations).'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in COBIT frameworks. Generate\
  \ high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for the topic 'BAI05: Organizational Change Enablement' (Category: Cybersecurity;\
  \ Domain: Security And Risk Management; Subdomain: Security Governance Principles; Entry: COBIT Process Framework > Build,\
  \ Acquire, and Implement (BAI)).\n\nIncorporate these elements:\n- **Topic Hierarchy**: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk\
  \ Management > Security Governance Principles > COBIT Process Framework > BAI > BAI05.\n- **Research Context**: OCE proactively\
  \ fosters adoption in cybersecurity changes (beyond traditional change mgmt). Key: user adoption, resistance (fear, misunderstanding).\
  \ COBIT BAI05: Managed Organizational Change Enablement – practices (plan initiatives, assess readiness, enable adoption);\
  \ goals (sustained change); metrics (adoption rates, resistance reduction). Integrate NIST CSF (Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover\
