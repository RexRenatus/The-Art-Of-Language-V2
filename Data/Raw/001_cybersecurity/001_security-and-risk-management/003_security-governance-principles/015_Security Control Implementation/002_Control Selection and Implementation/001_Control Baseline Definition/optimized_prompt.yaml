active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using a moderate baseline versus tailoring a low baseline
    for a cloud-based financial system with moderate CIA impacts. Reference NIST SP 800-53B examples and consider organizational
    risk tolerance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions: 1) Confuse with unrelated
    concepts (e.g., risk assessment vs. categorization); 2) Mix impact levels (e.g., high control as low); 3) Misstate tailoring
    (e.g., remove without justification). Ensure distractors are realistic from NIST examples.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST standards. Generate
  30 high-quality flashcards on ''Control Baseline Definition'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management
  > Security Governance Principles > Security Control Implementation > Control Selection and Implementation > Control Baseline
  Definition). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema
  exactly.


  **Prior Knowledge:** Assume learners know CIA triad and basic security categorization (FIPS 199/NIST SP 800-60).


  **Key Content:** Draw from NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final) and SP 800-53B (https://www.nist.gov/publications/control-baselines-information-systems-and-organizations).
  Include examples: Low baseline (e.g., AC-2 basic), Moderate (AC-2(1)), High (AC-2(4)). Cover tailoring steps, overlays,
  RMF integration, FISMA. Concept map: Central ''Control Baseline'' connects to ''Security Categorization'' (input), ''Tailoring/Overlays''
  (modification), ''RMF'' (framework).


  **Instructions:**

  - Distribute flashcards across 4 scaffolding layers (5-8 per layer).

  - Balance Bloom''s: 30% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 40% APPLY/ANALYZE, 30% EVALUATE/CREATE.

  - For MCQs: 1 correct + 3 distractors per protocol.

  - Every back includes explanation tying to pedagogy (e.g., ''This applies Layer 2 by comparing baselines'') and active learning
  tie-in (e.g., ''Use in peer-teaching'').

  - Ensure measurable, active recall format.

  - Output ONLY a JSON array matching the flashcard schema format. No extra text.'
