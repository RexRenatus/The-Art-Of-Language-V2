active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of cybersecurity governance, rank customer perspective goals (e.g., data protection, privacy,
    trust, compliance, risk mitigation) by importance for different industries like healthcare vs. e-commerce. Debate and
    justify with peers why priorities shift, referencing NIST CSF mappings.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Distractors must be plausible: Based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse CIA with privacy; mix NIST functions like
      Protect with Respond).'
    - 1 semi-correct (partial truth, e.g., 'Availability only' instead of full CIA).
    - 1 opposite (e.g., 'Ignore risks' for risk mitigation).
    - 1 unrelated (e.g., 'Financial profit' for trust goal).
    - Ensure 25% distractors from lower scaffolding layers to test progression.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 30 high-quality flashcards on
  ''Customer Perspective Goals'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Governance Principles
  > Goals Cascade and Alignment > Enterprise Goals > Customer Perspective Goals).


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Research Context: Customer goals = data protection (CIA), privacy, trust/transparency, compliance, risk mitigation, confidence.
  NIST CSF 2.0 full functions: Govern (oversight/trust), Identify (risks), Protect (safeguards/data protection), Detect (events),
  Respond (containment), Recover (restoration). Align all to customer goals. Frameworks: COBIT, ISO 27001. Example: Equifax
  breach failures in Detect/Respond.

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list from JSON above].

  - Active Learning: [Insert prompts/exercises from JSON above] – reference in explanations.

  - Scaffolding: [Insert 4 layers from JSON above] – tag each card to a layer.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly:

  - 10 Basic Q&A, 10 Cloze, 10 MCQ (1 correct, 3 distractors per protocol).

  - Distractor Protocol: [Insert rules from JSON above].

  - Every card: Question/Front, Answer/Back, Explanation (link Bloom''s, layer, NIST mapping, source).


  Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''Basic'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'':
  ''...'', ''layer'': ''...''}]. Ensure progressive difficulty: Layers 1-2 early cards, 3-4 later. Promote Bloom''s progression.'
