        "core_logic": "NIST SP 800-30 outlines risk responses including mitigation (reducing risk through controls) and acceptance (acknowledging and tolerating residual risk). These are distinct strategies for managing identified risks based on organizational risk tolerance and cost-benefit analysis.",
