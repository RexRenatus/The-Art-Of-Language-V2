active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs of sharing cyber threat intelligence across organizations using NIST SP 800-150
    guidelines. Argue for or against mandatory sharing in critical infrastructure sectors, citing benefits (e.g., proactive
    defense) and risks (e.g., data leakage).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
  additional_activities:
  - Think-pair-share on common misconceptions (e.g., 'All threat intel is classified' vs. open-source intelligence).
  - 'Role-play simulation: One group as threat actors using TTPs, another as defenders integrating CTI.'
  - 'Group project: Build a simple text-based TIP dashboard concept map showing CTI flow.'

    instead of artifacts); 2) Related but incorrect terms (e.g., ''TTPs'' vs. ''IoCs''); 3) Partial truths (e.g., NIST SP
    800-150 as ''only for classified intel''); 4) Voter-noted errors (e.g., ''All TI is classified''). Ensure distractors
    promote active recall and critical thinking.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in 'Threat Intelligence Integration'\
  \ (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Governance Principles > Threat Modeling and\
  \ Management > Threat Identification Approaches > Threat Intelligence Integration). Use the provided research context: CTI\
  \ (evidence-based threat knowledge: actors, TTPs, IoCs); TIPs (aggregate/analyze); NIST SP 800-150 (Guide to Cyber Threat\
  \ Information Sharing: collection, analysis, dissemination); MITRE ATT&CK (TTPs framework). Sources: NIST SP 800-150, MITRE\
  \ ATT&CK.\n\nIncorporate university pedagogy: Learning Objectives [insert full list above]; Active Learning [discussion,\
  \ peer teaching, problem-solving]; Scaffolding Layers [4 layers as defined]; Big Picture: Proactive defense for governance/compliance.\n\
  \nGenerate flashcards following this schema exactly: 25 cards (10 Q&A, 10 MCQ, 5 scenario-apply). For each:\n- **Front:**\
