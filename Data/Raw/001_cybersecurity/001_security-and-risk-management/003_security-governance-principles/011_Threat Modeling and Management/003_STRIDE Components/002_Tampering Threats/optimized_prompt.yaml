active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In small groups, debate the following: ''How does the Stuxnet worm exemplify a tampering threat, and
    why does it pose a greater risk to Integrity than other STRIDE threats like Denial of Service? Reference NIST SP 800-53
    controls like SI-7 and discuss preventive measures.'' Encourage critical thinking by requiring evidence from real-world
    cases and peer challenges to assumptions.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education. Generate 25 high-quality flashcards\
  \ on 'Tampering Threats' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Governance Principles\
  \ > Threat Modeling and Management > STRIDE Components > Tampering Threats). Ensure coverage: 30% Layer 1/Remember-Understand,\
  \ 30% Layer 2/Apply-Analyze, 40% Layer 3-4/Evaluate-Create. Incorporate research: tampering definitions, physical/logical\
  \ types, CIA Integrity link, NIST SP 800-53 full controls (CM-8: System Component Inventory - identify/document/maintain\
  \ inventory; SI-7: Software/Firmware/Information Integrity - detect changes, scans; CM-6, MA-6, SC-8), examples (Stuxnet\
  \ firmware tampering, Log4Shell data mods), APTs/insiders/malware. Use voter consensus: Complete NIST sections, Bloom's\
  \ progression, scaffolding layers, big picture in security governance.\n\nLearning Objectives: [Insert the 6 objectives\
  \ above].\nScaffolding Layers: [Insert the 4 layers above].\nActive Learning: Tie flashcards to discussion (Stuxnet debate),\
  \ peer teaching (NIST controls), problem-solving (Log4Shell scenario).\n\nOutput EXACTLY as JSON array of 25 objects, each\
