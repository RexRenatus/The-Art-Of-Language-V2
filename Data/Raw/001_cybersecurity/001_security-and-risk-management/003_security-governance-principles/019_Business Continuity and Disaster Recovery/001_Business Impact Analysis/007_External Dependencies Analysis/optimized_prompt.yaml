active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent should organizations hold third-party vendors accountable for supply chain risks, and
    how can frameworks like NIST CSF GV.SC be enforced contractually? Consider real-world examples like SolarWinds or Log4j
    vulnerabilities.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 1 plausible misconception (e.g., 'TPRM and C-SCRM are identical' ignoring scope differences)
    - 1 partial truth (e.g., correct framework but wrong category like GV.RM instead of GV.SC)
    - 1 unrelated/extreme option (e.g., 'Ignore all cloud providers' or irrelevant standard like PCI-DSS)
    - Base on voter-noted misconceptions (e.g., cloud security absolutes) or common errors from research (e.g., confusing
      SCRM with general procurement)

  - Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]

  - Active learning ties: Reference discussions/case studies in explanations (e.g., SolarWinds for vendor accountability).

  - 4 Scaffolding layers: [INSERT scaffolding_layers ARRAY HERE] – Ensure even coverage.


  Generate high-quality MCQ flashcards using this EXACT schema: [INSERT flashcard_schema HERE].


  Content must be comprehensive: Complete NIST SP 800-161r1 coverage (multilevel C-SCRM, identify/assess/mitigate/monitor
  risks, ERM integration); NIST CSF 2.0 GV.SC; TPRM/SCRM/C-SCRM distinctions; BIA linkages. Use web-grounded facts (e.g.,
  counterfeits/malicious inserts as risks). Distractors per protocol.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"front": "Question?", "back": {"correct_answer": "D", "options": ["A.
