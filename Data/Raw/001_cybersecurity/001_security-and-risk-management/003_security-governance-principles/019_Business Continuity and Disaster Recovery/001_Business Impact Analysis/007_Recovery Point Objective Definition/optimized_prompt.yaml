active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether a zero RPO is feasible and desirable for all organizations. Consider
    costs, cybersecurity threats (e.g., ransomware), and business types (e.g., finance requiring near-zero data loss vs. manufacturing
    tolerating hours). Use real-world examples and reference BIA outcomes to support positions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., RPO= downtime metric
    like RTO), 2) Edge cases (e.g., zero RPO as always feasible), 3) Related terms (e.g., MTD as data loss), 4) Real-world
    errors (e.g., ignoring costs in backup frequency). Ensure distractors are realistic from voter/research context (e.g.,
    ransomware data loss vs. outage).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security and Risk Management
  > Security Governance Principles > Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery > Business Impact Analysis > Recovery Point
  Objective Definition. Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Spaced Repetition using university pedagogy:
  Bloom''s Taxonomy (cover all levels via objectives), active learning inspiration (e.g., debate zero RPO, peer analogies
  for RPO vs RTO, hospital scenario), 4-layer scaffolding (foundation terms/BIA link, components/relations/diagram, implementation/backup
  calc, integration/DRP/examples like ransomware), and voter consensus (completeness with backup strategies, real-world cases).


  Incorporate research: RPO = max tolerable data loss time (NIST/AWS/Drata); influences backup frequency (e.g., 1hr RPO →
  hourly backups); zero RPO via real-time replication; vs RTO (downtime)/MTD.


  Use this EXACT flashcard schema for output as a JSON array of 50 objects: [flashcard1, flashcard2, ...]. Schema details:
  {"type": "mcq" or "short_answer", "front": "...", "back": "...", "explanation": "...", "distractors": [...] if mcq, "bloom_level":
  "remember|understand|apply|analyze|evaluate|create", "scaffolding_layer": 1|2|3|4}. Ensure 40% MCQs (distractors plausible
  per protocol), 60% balanced across layers/Bloom''s. Vary difficulty: 30% easy (Layer1/Remember), 40% medium (Apply/Analyze),
  30% hard (Evaluate/Create). No duplicates; inspire from active learning prompts for scenario-based cards.'
