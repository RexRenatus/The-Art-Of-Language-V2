active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the potential consequences of poor stakeholder communication during a ransomware
    attack. Reference NIST SP 800-61r2/r3 coordination strategies and FEMA guidelines. What metrics would you use to evaluate
    communication effectiveness post-incident? (Encourages critical thinking and evidence-based arguments).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truth (e.g., valid for IR but not DR); 3) Extreme/overly simplistic (e.g., ''email only'' vs. multi-channel).
    Ensure plausible based on voter suggestions (e.g., incomplete NIST refs) and research context (e.g., mislink PII handling).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security Governance Principles.

  prompt to generate high-quality flashcards.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the full ''learning_objectives'' array here].


  **Active Learning Components:** Incorporate references to [discussion_prompt], [peer_teaching_activity], [problem_solving_exercise]
  in explanations to encourage application.


  **Scaffolding Layers:** Build cards progressively: Layer 1 [layer1_foundation]; Layer 2 [layer2_components]; Layer 3 [layer3_implementation];
  Layer 4 [layer4_integration]. Balance 25% per layer.


  **Research Context:** DR Communications Plan ensures stakeholder comms during disruptions (NIST SP 800-61r2/r3: Incident
  comms coordination; NIST CSF: Respond/Recover; ISO 22301: BCMS comms; FEMA: Emergency messaging). Key terms: [from context].
  Examples: Stakeholder lists (IT, execs, regulators), templates (''Incident confirmed: Status, Actions, Next Steps''), escalation
  (Tier 1->2->Exec). Sources: NIST SP 800-61r3 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r3.pdf),
  ISO 22301, FEMA.gov.


  **Flashcard Generation:** Output 25 flashcards in JSON array using exact [flashcard_schema]. Ensure university pedagogy:
  Bloom''s-balanced (30% lower, 40% mid, 30% higher levels), active recall, spaced repetition friendly. 60% MCQ, 40% short
  answer/cloze. Distractors per protocol. Tie to prior knowledge (DR basics: RTO/RPO). Voter priorities: Complete NIST details,
  add examples/templates, SMART objectives.'
