  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Periodic test restores are more effective than automated
    hashing for backup integrity verification in ransomware-prone environments.'' Support your position with references to
    NIST SP 1800-25 and real-world examples like DR drills, considering trade-offs in time, cost, and reliability.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    instead of integrity); 2) Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Checksums are collision-resistant like SHA-256'');
    3) Irrelevant/confusable term (e.g., ''Encryption'' vs. ''Hashing''). Ensure plausibility from research/voter suggestions;
    avoid obvious errors.'

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [REMEMBER: Define terms; UNDERSTAND: Role in recovery; APPLY: Checksum process; ANALYZE: Compare
  methods; EVALUATE: Critique strategies; CREATE: Design protocols].

  - Scaffolding: Layer 1 (Foundation: defs, prior links); Layer 2 (Components: tools like SHA-256, NIST SP 1800-25 [https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/1800/25/final],
  Azure Benchmark PA-9); Layer 3 (Implementation: steps, rsync/Veeam); Layer 4 (Integration: automation, immutable storage,
  ransomware resilience).

  - Active Learning: Draw from discussion (ransomware debate), peer teaching (methods), problem-solving (failed backup scenarios).

  - Big Picture: Ensures BCDR reliability; voter consensus (82.9%) on completeness/pedagogy.

  - Sources: NIST SP 1800-25(A/B/C), CSWP 17; Azure Security Benchmark (DP-5 integrity).


  Flashcard Format (JSON array of objects):

  [{ "front": "Question", "back": { "answer": "Correct answer", "explanation": "Pedagogical rationale w/ Bloom''s, layer,
  source", "distractors": ["A) Distractor1", "B) Distractor2", "C) Distractor3", "D) Correct"], "hint": "Scaffold hint", "source":
  "Citation" } }]


  Schema Rules: 40% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND (basic Qs); 30% APPLY/ANALYZE (processes/comparisons); 30% EVALUATE/CREATE (scenarios/designs).
  Distractors: 3 plausible per card (misconceptions, partial truths). Explanations: Tie to objectives/scaffolding/active learning.
  Vary formats: cloze, MCQ, short answer. Ensure active recall, spaced repetition optimization.'
