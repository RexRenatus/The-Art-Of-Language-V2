active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of warm sites versus hot and cold sites for a hospital (RTO=4 hours, high regulation)
    versus a retail chain (RTO=48 hours, cost-sensitive). Consider costs, risks, data sync challenges, regulatory compliance
    (e.g., HIPAA), and BIA alignment to foster critical thinking on recovery strategy selection.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Weave in references to discussion debates, peer teaching, and problem-solving scenarios.

  - Scaffolding: Ensure coverage across 4 layers: [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING DESCRIPTION].

  - Best Practices (from NIST SP 800-34 Rev 1 and voters): Align with BIA/RTO; site selection (geographic separation, compatibility);
  partial hardware/software/telecom; data sync (periodic); testing (tabletop, parallel, full); vendor SLAs; training/maintenance.


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards using this schema: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD SCHEMA].


  Facts: Warm site = partially equipped (hardware/software/power/telecom), operational but needs hours-days setup; cheaper
  than hot (fully mirrored), costlier than cold (basic). Prior knowledge: BIA identifies critical systems.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, e.g., [{''type'': ''Multiple Choice'', ''front'': ''...'', ...}]. Balance across
  objectives/layers; make engaging/optimized for spaced repetition (Anki-compatible).'
