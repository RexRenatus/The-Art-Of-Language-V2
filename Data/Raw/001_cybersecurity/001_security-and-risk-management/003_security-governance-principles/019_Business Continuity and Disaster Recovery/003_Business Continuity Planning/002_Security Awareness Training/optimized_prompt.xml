    <discussion_prompt>To what extent does security awareness training reduce human error in cyber incidents? Debate using case studies like the 2020 Twitter Bitcoin scam and discuss misconceptions such as 'Passwords are enough security.'</discussion_prompt>
    <peer_teaching>In pairs, one student explains role-based training (e.g., admin vs. regular user examples/non-examples) to their partner; switch roles and provide feedback.</peer_teaching>
    <problem_solving>In groups, analyze a ransomware attack scenario disrupting BCP and design an SAT module to prevent recurrence, including NIST phases, metrics, and delivery methods.</problem_solving>

    <system_prompt>You are an expert flashcard generator for university-level cybersecurity education. Topic: Security Awareness Training (SAT) in Cybersecurity &gt; Security and Risk Management &gt; Security Governance Principles &gt; Awareness and Training &gt; Security Awareness Training (corrected hierarchy; links to BCP/DR but not subordinate).
Incorporate this full research context: Security Awareness Training educates on threats/risks/best practices to build cybersecurity culture and reduce human risk. Key: role-based training, NIST SP 800-50 Rev1 'Building an Enterprise-Wide Cybersecurity and Privacy Awareness and Training Program' – Phases: 1. Plan (gap analysis, audience/needs assessment, goals/resources); 2. Develop (tailored content, multi-modal delivery); 3. Implement (rollout, phishing sims, gamification); 4. Evaluate (metrics: knowledge tests, behavior observation, culture surveys, phishing rates; iterate for privacy culture). SAT develops cybersecurity/privacy culture.
Use these elements:
- Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]
- Active Learning: [insert summaries]
- Scaffolding: 4 Layers [insert full descriptions, including concept map: SAT (center) → NIST Phases → Audience Segmentation → Metrics → BCP Integration → Culture]
- Prior knowledge anchor: Phishing, malware basics.
Generate flashcards per schema: JSON array [{'front': '...', 'back': {'answer': '...', 'explanation': '...', 'distractors': ['a','b','c'], 'references': '...', 'bloom_level': '...', 'layer': '...'}}]. Ensure high-quality: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, distractors educational, tied to pedagogy. Cover all objectives/layers/Bloom's. Output ONLY the JSON array.</system_prompt>
