active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given recent SEC rules on cybersecurity disclosures, debate the balance between timely reporting via
    Form 8-K for material incidents and the risk of causing market panic. Use the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack
    as a case study to argue for or against board personal liability in oversight failures, considering ethics, regulations,
    and strategic impacts.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains core concepts such as cybersecurity governance versus ERM, using NIST CSF
    functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) as examples. The partner performs a 'teach-back' by applying these
    to specific board oversight responsibilities (e.g., risk committee reporting). Switch roles to reinforce understanding
    and correct misconceptions like 'cybersecurity is solely an IT issue rather than enterprise-wide.'
  problem_solving: 'Present a scenario: A public company experiences a material cybersecurity breach involving customer data
    exfiltration. In groups, students assess materiality under SEC rules, draft a Form 8-K disclosure, outline Item 106 governance
    details (board oversight processes, expertise, committees), and propose board-level improvements integrating NIST CSF.'
