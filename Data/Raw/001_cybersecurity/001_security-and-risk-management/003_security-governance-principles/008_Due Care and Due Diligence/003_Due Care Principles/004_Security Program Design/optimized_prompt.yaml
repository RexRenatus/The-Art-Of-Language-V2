active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what ways does the NIST CSF Govern function integrate cybersecurity into enterprise risk management,
    and how might this conflict with short-term business pressures in a startup (e.g., Tier 2 Risk Informed) versus a large
    corporation (e.g., Tier 4 Adaptive)? Debate the trade-offs and propose resolutions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    list 5/6 CSF functions), (2) Confusions (e.g., swap GOVERN with IDENTIFY), (3) Edge cases (e.g., outdated CSF 1.1 without
    GOVERN), (4) Irrelevant details (e.g., ISO 27001 instead of NIST). Ensure distractors test deeper understanding, not trivia.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security Program Design
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Governance Principles > Due Care and Due Diligence
  > Due Care Principles > Security Program Design). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (25 MCQ, 15 cloze/short answer, 10
  higher-order application) optimized for Anki/Quizlet using university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy progression, active learning
  hooks, 4-layer scaffolding, and distractor best practices.


  **Core Content Summary (Complete & Authoritative):** Security Program Design creates structured policies/procedures/controls
  protecting CIA Triad (Confidentiality: authorized access; Integrity: accuracy; Availability: timely access) and ensuring
  trustworthiness via risk management. Builds on Due Care (reasonable protections to avoid negligence). NIST CSF 2.0: 6 Functions—**GOVERN**
  (risk strategy/policy/oversight); **IDENTIFY** (risks/assets); **PROTECT** (safeguards); **DETECT** (events); **RESPOND**
  (mitigate); **RECOVER** (restore). Tiers: **Partial (1)** (ad-hoc/reactive); **Risk Informed (2)** (formal risks, inconsistent);
  **Repeatable (3)** (defined/managed); **Adaptive (4)** (proactive/adaptive). Implementation: Current/Target Profiles, gap
  prioritization. Integrate with ERM/ISO 27001. Misconceptions: CIA excludes availability (false); GOVERN optional (false,
  core in 2.0). Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/framework), SP 800-53.
