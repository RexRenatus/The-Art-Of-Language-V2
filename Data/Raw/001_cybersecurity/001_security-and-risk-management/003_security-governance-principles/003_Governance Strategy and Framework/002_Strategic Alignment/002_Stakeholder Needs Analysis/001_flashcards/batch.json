        "core_logic": "Because safeguards and countermeasures are designed to impede threat events, their presence and effectiveness directly influence the probability that an event will occur or succeed. This works by reducing the organizational susceptibility to threats, thereby lowering the assessed likelihood of adverse impacts and refining the overall risk calculation.",

        "analogy": "Considering safeguards when assessing likelihood is like checking if a house has deadbolts and an alarm system when assessing the likelihood of a burglary; these defenses reduce the probability of a successful break-in."
