active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges of balancing conflicting stakeholder needs (e.g., executives
    prioritizing cost savings vs. regulators demanding strict compliance) in cybersecurity governance. Use examples from NIST
    CSF or real-world breaches to support your arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Use this optimized content to generate 25 high-quality flashcards:


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the full learning_objectives array here]


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the full scaffolding array here]


  **Active Learning Integration:** Ensure flashcards support discussion (debate conflicts), peer teaching (teach layers),
  problem-solving (scenarios).


  **Related Concepts:** Risk Appetite Determination, Governance Frameworks, Regulatory Compliance.


  **Research Context:** Definitions from NIST CSF 2.0 (Govern GV.OC-02: Understand internal/external stakeholder needs), ISO
  27001 Clause 6.1 (interested parties), COBIT 2019 APO12 Managed Risk (stakeholder value drivers). Sources: NIST CSF 2.0
  PDF (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.CSWP.29), ISO/IEC 27001:2022, COBIT 2019 (ISACA), CISSP CBK, FAIR Institute.


  **Flashcard Generation Rules:**

  - Follow exact schema: Mix basic (30%), cloze (20%), MCQ (50%).

  - Cover Bloom''s progression and 4 layers proportionally.

  - Distractors: 3 per MCQ, plausible via protocol.

  - Each card: Tie to objective/layer, include explanation with framework ref/source.

  - Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': {...}, ''back'': {...}, ''scaffolding_layer'': 1, ''bloom_level'':
  ''REMEMBER''}]
