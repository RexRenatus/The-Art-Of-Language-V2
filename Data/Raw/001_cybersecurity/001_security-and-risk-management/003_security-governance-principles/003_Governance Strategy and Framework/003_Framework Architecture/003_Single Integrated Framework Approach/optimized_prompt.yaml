active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether the Single Integrated Framework Approach (using NIST CSF 2.0 GOVERN
    function) is superior to siloed risk management in a multinational corporation facing diverse geopolitical and cyber threats.
    Support with evidence from CSF Organizational Profiles and ERM integration.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truth/outdated info (e.g., CSF 1.1 functions without GOVERN); 3) Confusable term (e.g., mix-up IDENTIFY with
    GOVERN; siloed example as integrated). Ensure distractors teach via explanation.'

  **Core Content (Web-Grounded, Completed Sections):** Single Integrated Framework unifies cybersecurity with ERM/ICT risks,
  exemplified by NIST CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/cybersecurity-framework-20). Key: GOVERN function (organizational
  context, oversight, risk strategy); CSF Organizational Profiles (custom risk views); Tiers (maturity). Benefits: Breaks
  silos, aligns with enterprise objectives. Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (SP 800-53 rev5 integration), NIST.CSWP.29 PDF (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.29.pdf),
  ISO 27001 (non-example siloed).


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [insert array above]. Cover evenly across Bloom''s (Remember/Understand: 30%, Apply/Analyze: 40%,
  Evaluate/Create: 30%).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards: Layer1 20%, Layer2 25%, Layer3 30%, Layer4 25%. Reference prior knowledge (ERM basics).

  - Active Learning Tie-Ins: 10% cards prompt discussion/peer teach/problem-solve (e.g., ''Debate pro/con integrated vs siloed'').


  **Output Exactly in JSON Array:** [array of 40-50 flashcards, each per flashcard_schema structure]. Use schema strictly:
  front/back/explanation/tags/type. Ensure variety, no duplicates, optimized for active recall (spaced repetition). Distractors
  per protocol. Explanations scaffold learning.


  Prioritize: Completeness (full CSF Organizational: risk-informed profiles linking cyber/ERM); Engagement (scenario/role-play
  hints); Progression (foundation to integration).'
