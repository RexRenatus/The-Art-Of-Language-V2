active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether accountability for data protection should ever be fully delegable from
    the data owner to a custodian or processor. Use real-world examples like a GDPR breach to support your position and evaluate
    counterarguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
