active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent should cybersecurity measures, such as widespread surveillance, be limited to protect
    civil liberties? Debate using real-world examples like the NSA PRISM program or GDPR enforcement cases, referencing the
    NIST Privacy Framework functions to argue trade-offs between security and privacy.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Semantic shift (similar term, wrong context, e.g., ''cybersecurity
    risk'' for ''privacy risk''); 2) Partial truth (incomplete function description); 3) Common misconception (e.g., conflate
    Protect-P with cybersecurity ''Protect'' function). Ensure distractors teach by contrast.'
