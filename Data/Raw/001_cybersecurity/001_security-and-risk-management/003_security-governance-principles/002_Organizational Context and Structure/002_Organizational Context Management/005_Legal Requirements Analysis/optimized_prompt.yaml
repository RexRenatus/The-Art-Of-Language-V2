active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate whether voluntary frameworks like NIST CSF 2.0 are sufficient for legal compliance or if mandatory
    regulations like GDPR provide better security outcomes. Use case studies of fines (e.g., British Airways £20M GDPR breach
    due to Magecart attack) to support arguments, considering factors like enforcement, flexibility, and real-world risk mitigation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
