active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate whether strict Segregation of Duties (SoD) can hinder operational agility in high-pressure cybersecurity
    incident response teams. Use real-world examples from Zero Trust implementations, banking refund approvals, or e-commerce
    workflows. Propose hybrid approaches that balance security with speed, addressing common misconceptions like SoD being
    mere bureaucratic overhead.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    small teams''); ensure distractors are realistic from research context (e.g., insider threat examples) and voter suggestions
    (e.g., agility trade-offs).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Segregation of Duties (SoD)

  Implementation).


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [REMEMBER: Define SoD... CREATE: Develop policy...] (cover all evenly).

  - Scaffolding Layers: Layer 1 Foundation (definitions); Layer 2 Components (PoLP/RBAC relations); Layer 3 Implementation
  (steps, matrices, examples like banking refunds); Layer 4 Integration (env segregation dev/test/prod, Zero Trust).

  - Active Learning Tie-ins: Reference discussion (agility trade-offs), peer teaching (Four Eyes non-examples), problem-solving
  (e-commerce scenarios).

  - Research Context: SoD divides tasks to mitigate insider threats/errors; Four Eyes; compliance; examples: refunds need
  dual approval; env separation.


  Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema:

  - Mix formats: 30% Q&A/cloze, 40% MCQ (4 options), 20% scenarios, 10% higher-order.

  - Each: Front (question), Back (answer + 1-2 sentence explanation + distractor debrief if MCQ + pedagogical note + tags:
  Bloom level, Layer, Hierarchy).

  - Distractors: Plausible (misconceptions, partial truths, extremes).

  - Ensure progression: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 30% Layer 3, 20% Layer 4; span all Bloom levels.

  - Optimize for Anki/Spaced Repetition: Active recall, no hints on front, concise backs.
