active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs in prioritizing capability requirements (e.g., data encryption) versus statement
    of work requirements (e.g., regular audits) for a healthcare system, considering NIST SP 800-53 guidelines. How do stakeholder
    needs and risk assessments influence these priorities? Support arguments with examples from authoritative sources.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
