active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast penetration testing and vulnerability scanning using NIST SP 800-115 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/115/final).
    Debate which is more effective for integration validation in a DevSecOps pipeline, considering factors like speed, depth,
    and false positives.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Base on common misconceptions (e.g., ''Testing is only post-deployment'' → distractor: ''Security testing occurs solely
      after full system deployment'').'
    - Use non-examples (e.g., siloed controls → 'Security testing ignores inter-system dependencies').
    - Incorporate partial truths (e.g., wrong NIST phase order or control family).
    - Draw from real-world errors (e.g., SolarWinds-like gaps).
    - 'Ensure plausibility: Distractors should be voter-suggested or research-grounded (e.g., confuse SP 800-115 phases with
      RMF steps).'
    balance: 'Generate 20-30 flashcards: 40% MCQ (with distractors), 30% short answer, 20% true/false, 10% application-based.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on the topic ''Integration and Testing''
  using this EXACT topic hierarchy: {''Level 1'': ''Cybersecurity'', ''Level 2'': ''Security And Risk Management'', ''Level
  3'': ''Security Governance Principles'', ''Level 4'': ''Implementation and Lifecycle'', ''Level 5'': ''System Lifecycle
  Management'', ''Level 6'': ''Integration and Testing''}.


  Incorporate these learning objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]. Ensure flashcards align to specified Bloom''s
  levels.


  Integrate active learning hooks: Reference discussion prompts, peer teaching, or problem-solving in explanations where relevant.


  Structure content across 4 scaffolding layers: [INSERT scaffolding OBJECT HERE]. Distribute flashcards: 6 Layer 1, 7 Layer
  2, 7 Layer 3, 5 Layer 4.


  Use authoritative sources: NIST SP 800-115 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/115/final), SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final),
  SP 800-37 Rev. 2 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/37/r2/final). Address prior knowledge (system lifecycle stages), misconceptions
  (post-deployment only testing, siloed controls), big picture (RMF role), real-world (SolarWinds).


  Output EXACTLY in JSON array of objects matching this flashcard schema: [INSERT flashcard_schema STRUCTURE HERE]. Follow
  distractor protocol strictly for MCQs. Make questions optimized for active recall, explanations pedagogical (link to objectives/activities).
