active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How do the security needs of regulators (e.g., compliance reporting) differ from those of end-users (e.g.,
    usability) in a financial institution? Debate using examples from the NIST CSF Govern function and real-world breaches
    like SolarWinds.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Topic Context:** Stakeholder Needs Analysis (Category: Cybersecurity; Domain: Security And Risk Management; Subdomain:
  Security Governance Principles; Entry Domain: Implementation and Lifecycle; Entry Subdomain: System Lifecycle Management).
  Topic Hierarchy: Level 1: Cybersecurity → Level 2: Security And Risk Management → Level 3: Security Governance Principles
  → Level 4: Implementation and Lifecycle → Level 5: System Lifecycle Management → Level 6: Stakeholder Needs Analysis.


  **Core Content (Web-Grounded Research):** Stakeholder needs analysis identifies/gathers/analyzes requirements of stakeholders
  (end-users, IT, execs, customers, partners, regulators, threat actors) for cybersecurity alignment. Key: NIST CSF (Govern:
  oversight/strategy); NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 (full guide: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-30r1.pdf
  – stakeholder inputs for threat ID, vulnerabilities, risk determination); ISO/IEC 27001 (https://www.iso.org/standard/27001
  – stakeholder-informed controls); CIS Controls. Steps: Identify, Gather (surveys/interviews), Analyze/Prioritize, Document/Validate.
  Integration: Risk lifecycle, iterative feedback. Sources: NIST CSF (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework); ISO 27001; Bitsight
  (stakeholder risk ratings); FTC cybersecurity guidance (https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/privacy-security/cybersecurity).
