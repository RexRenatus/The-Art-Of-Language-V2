active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a multi-regulatory environment (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS), should organizations adopt a comprehensive
    framework like HITRUST CSF for mapping compliance requirements, or tailor mappings to individual regulations? Debate trade-offs
    in cost, scalability, and risk coverage.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse HITRUST domains with NIST functions; overlook Govern in CSF 2.0; mix HIPAA
    with PCI).

    - Use partial truths (e.g., correct framework but wrong component).

    - Draw from research (e.g., outdated CSF 1.1 without Govern).

    Ensure distractors promote active recall/discrimination.'

  Use this completed research context:

  ## Compliance Requirements Mapping

  [Insert full research context here, including scaffolding content above for Layers 1-4, completed frameworks (HITRUST: 14
  domains; NIST CSF 2.0: GV/ID/PR/DE/RS/RC; CIS Controls: 18 safeguards), and sources: HITRUST (hitrustalliance.net), NIST
  CSF 2.0 (nist.gov/cyberframework), CIS Controls (cisecurity.org/controls), ISO 27001 (iso.org), HIPAA (hhs.gov/hipaa), GDPR
  (gdpr.eu), PCI DSS (pcisecuritystandards.org)].


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste array from above].

  - Active Learning: Use discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving to inspire higher-order questions (e.g., ''Debate trade-offs...''
  or mapping scenarios).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers [reference layers above].


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards following this exact schema [paste flashcard_schema.structure above]. Output ONLY a
  JSON array of 30 flashcard objects. Ensure variety: 40% MCQ, 60% cloze/short answer. Distractors per protocol. Align to
  Bloom''s progression and voter consensus (e.g., mappings, comparisons, NIST completion). Make explanations educational,
  referencing sources/scaffolding for active learning reinforcement.'
