active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a debate format, argue whether Purple Teaming should always follow Red Teaming exercises or if independent
    operations are more effective for unbiased assessments. Support with pros/cons (e.g., collaboration accelerates learning
    vs. realism requires isolation), real-world examples (e.g., financial sector TIBER-EU implementations), and ties to vulnerability
    management.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Plausible alternatives: Based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse Red with Pentesting; Blue with Purple).'
    - 'Related concepts: Use terms from adjacent layers (e.g., TTPs as ''tools only'').'
    - 'Frequency: 60% MCQs with distractors; ensure 1 correct always first/marked.'
    - 'Avoid: Obvious wrongs; ensure distractors teach via explanation.'
    example:
      question: What is the primary goal of Purple Teaming?
      correct: Collaborative red-blue learning.
      distractors:
      - Solo red attacks
      - Blue-only defense drills
      - Physical pentesting only
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Red Team Operations (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Governance Principles > Security Operations Governance
  > Vulnerability Management > Red Team Operations). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities, scaffolding
  layers (4 layers), and flashcard schema to create high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards.


  **Core Content Sources:** Integrate research summary (Red Teaming defs, MITRE ATT&CK TTPs, Blue/Purple teams, TIBER-EU full
  phases: Planning/Target Selection, Intelligence Gathering, Red Teaming Simulation/Execution, Blue Team Testing/Response,
  Reporting/Debrief; NIST CSF), voter suggestions (ethical dilemmas, e-commerce scenarios), and concept map (Red Teaming central
  → TTPs/Teams/Frameworks).


  **Instructions:**

  1. Generate 40-50 flashcards covering all Bloom levels (at least 1-2 per objective), balanced across 4 scaffolding layers
  (10 per layer).

  2. Strictly follow flashcard schema: Mix types (60% MCQ with distractor protocol, 20% Definition/Cloze, 20% Application).
  Each card tags Bloom level, layer, related active learning.

  3. Ensure active recall: Questions test higher-order thinking where possible (e.g., ''Apply TTP to scenario''). Explanations
  scaffold learning, reference objectives/layers.

  4. Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'':
  ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''related_active_learning'': ''...''}, ''type'': ''MCQ/Definition/Application''}].

  5. Pedagogy: Align to university-style (Bloom progression, active learning ties). No criminal advice—focus ethical, defensive
  insights.
