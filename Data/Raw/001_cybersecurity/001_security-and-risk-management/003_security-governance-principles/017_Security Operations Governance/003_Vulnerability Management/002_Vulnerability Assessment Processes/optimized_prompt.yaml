active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a scenario where multiple critical vulnerabilities (e.g., 5 high CVSS scores) are discovered across
    hybrid cloud systems with a limited remediation budget, debate prioritization strategies. Consider CVSS base metrics vs.
    business impact (e.g., asset criticality), referencing real-world cases like Heartbleed (2014 OpenSSL flaw) or Log4Shell
    (2021 Apache Log4j). What trade-offs exist between technical severity and operational risk?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    assessment = exploitation'' vs. identification), 2) Partial truth (e.g., correct tool but wrong step), 3) Related concept
    mix-up (e.g., CVSS confused with CWE). Ensure stem tests higher-order thinking where possible; correct answer not first.'

  **Core Content (Research Context - Completed/Expanded per NIST/OWASP/CIS):** Vulnerability assessment systematically identifies,
  quantifies, prioritizes weaknesses (software flaws, misconfigs, etc.) to improve security posture pre-exploitation. NIST
  defs: Vulnerability (exploitable weakness), Threat (potential adverse event), Risk (impact x likelihood), Risk Assessment
  (threat-vuln analysis). NIST CSF 2.0: Six functions - Govern (GV: risk mgmt strategy), Identify (ID: asset/risk assessment
  incl. ID.RA), Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover. OWASP: Testing Guide for web vulns (A01:2021 Broken Access Control etc.).
  CIS Controls v8: Control 7 (vuln scanning, prioritization, remediation tracking). Tools: Nessus (Tenable, auth scans), OpenVAS
  (free). Process: Scope → Inventory → Scan → Prioritize (CVSS v3.1: Attack Vector/Complexity/Privs/Impact/User/Scope) → Report/Remediate.
  Integration: SIEM (Splunk/ELK), Patch Mgmt (WSUS/Ansible), Automation/ML (prioritization). Real cases: Heartbleed, Log4Shell.
  Sources: NIST.gov/cyberframework (SP800-30/53/CSF2.0), OWASP.org/testing-guide, CISecurity.org/controls, Tenable.com/nessus,
