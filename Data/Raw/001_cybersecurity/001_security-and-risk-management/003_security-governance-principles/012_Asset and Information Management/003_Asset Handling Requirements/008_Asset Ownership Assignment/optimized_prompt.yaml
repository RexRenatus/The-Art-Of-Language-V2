active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages and disadvantages of centralized versus decentralized asset
    ownership models in a large enterprise. Consider implications for incident response speed, compliance auditing, and scalability.
    Support arguments with references to NIST SP 800-53 CM-8 or ISO/IEC 27001.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in 'Asset Ownership Assignment'\
  \ (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Governance Principles > Asset and Information\
  \ Management > Asset Handling Requirements > Asset Ownership Assignment). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning\
  \ activities, 4-layer scaffolding, concept map, prior knowledge (asset inventory), big picture (risk treatment/compliance/incident\
  \ response), and research context to generate 30 high-quality flashcards (10 per basic/advanced split).\n\nSources: NIST\
  \ SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (CM-8: Inventory with accountability; PL-2: Roles); NIST CSF (ID.AM-1/2: Asset inventory by owner/criticality);\
