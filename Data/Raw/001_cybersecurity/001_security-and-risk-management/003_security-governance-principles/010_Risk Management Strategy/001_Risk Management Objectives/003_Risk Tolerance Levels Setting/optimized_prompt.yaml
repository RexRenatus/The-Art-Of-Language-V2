active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the implications of setting high versus low risk tolerance levels in a
    healthcare organization facing ransomware threats. Use NISTIR 8286A definitions to argue how this aligns (or misaligns)
    with ERM and provide real-world examples from recent breaches.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs: 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse appetite with tolerance;
    mix CSF/RMF steps; overlook ERM integration). Source from research context (e.g., vague ''appetite'' as distractor for

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security and Risk Management
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Governance Principles > Risk Management Strategy
  > Risk Management Objectives > Risk Tolerance Levels Setting). Use 82.9% voter-approved content focusing on NIST SP 800-37
  Rev. 3 RMF ''Prepare'' step (establish risk appetite, tolerance, acceptance), NISTIR 8286A definitions, and CSRM-ERM integration.


  Core Content Summary:

  - Definitions: Risk Appetite (broad, leadership-set); Risk Tolerance (specific variance acceptable); CSRM (cyber subset);
  ERM (holistic).

  - Steps: 1) Assess appetite; 2) Define tolerances/objective; 3) Align regs; 4) Document/review.

  - Frameworks: RMF Prepare, CSF GV.RM.

  - Concept Map: Appetite → Tolerance → CSRM → ERM.
