active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare the vulnerability identification processes in NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 2 versus NIST CSF 2.0 Identify
    function. Which is more effective for small businesses versus enterprises? Debate pros/cons, referencing predisposing
    conditions and real-world exploit examples like Heartbleed.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, Student A explains core concepts (vulnerability, threat, risk, predisposing condition) using NIST
    SP 800-30 definitions with examples/non-examples (e.g., Heartbleed bug as vulnerability, phishing as threat, unpatched
    software as predisposing condition); Student B teaches back, quizzes with scenarios, and provides feedback. Switch roles
    after 10 minutes.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: An organization runs an outdated web server (e.g., Apache 2.2.22 with known CVEs like CVE-2014-6271).
    In groups, identify vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions using hypothetical Nessus scan results. Prioritize risks
    by likelihood/impact, recommend mitigation steps, and present findings.'

  **Completed Research Context (Web-Grounded, Authoritative Sources):**

  Vulnerability identification discovers weaknesses in systems/processes exploitable by threats (NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 2). Key
  Definitions (NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 2):

  - Vulnerability: Weakness in IT systems, procedures, controls, or implementation exploitable by threats.

  - Threat: Potential circumstance/event adversely impacting ops/assets via info systems.

  - Risk: Function of impact x likelihood.

  - Predisposing Condition: Existing organizational conditions (e.g., poor patching, untrained staff) increasing vulnerability
  likelihood.

  - Process Steps: (1) Identify assets, (2) Categorize threats, (3) Scan/test for vulns/predisposing conditions (automated:
  Nessus/OpenVAS; manual: pen-testing, audits), (4) Pair with threats for risk estimation.

  Methods: Dynamic/application scanning, config reviews (NIST SP 800-53 RA-5). Frameworks: NIST CSF 2.0 Identify (ID.RA-3:
  Vuln discovery). Build on prior: Counterpart to threat ID.

  **Pedagogical Integration:** Use provided learning_objectives (span Bloom''s: REMEMBER to CREATE), active_learning activities
  (discussion/peer/problem-solving for reinforcement), scaffolding layers (progress from foundation to integration). Ensure
  flashcards scaffold learning, reference prior knowledge (threats/risks).


  **Generate Flashcards:** Follow flashcard_schema exactly. Output JSON array: [{''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'',
  ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''source'': ''...''}}]. Cover all objectives/layers evenly. 40-60
  cards total. High-quality, exam-ready (e.g., CISSP-aligned). Vary difficulty; include scenarios from active learning.'
