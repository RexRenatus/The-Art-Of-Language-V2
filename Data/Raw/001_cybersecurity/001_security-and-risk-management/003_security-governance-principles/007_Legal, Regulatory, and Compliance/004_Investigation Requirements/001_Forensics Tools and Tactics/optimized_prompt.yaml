active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of prioritizing volatile vs. non-volatile data collection in a live OT incident,
    such as a ransomware attack on industrial controls. What tactics (e.g., live acquisition with Volatility) ensure chain
    of custody while maintaining operational availability?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student teaches the concepts of hashing (e.g., SHA-256 for integrity) and chain of custody
    using real-world examples (e.g., evidence transfer logs); the partner uses teach-back method to explain back, then switch
    roles.
  problem_solving: 'Given a breach scenario (e.g., suspected malware on an OT system), students design a triage plan: select
    tools (Volatility for RAM dump, FTK Imager for disk imaging, Wireshark for network capture), outline steps for acquisition
    and verification, and justify choices based on order of volatility.'

    for physical evidence''); 2) Related but incorrect concept (e.g., confuse MD5 with encryption); 3) Partial truth/extreme
    (e.g., ''Always power off before imaging'' ignoring live volatility). Ensure distractors test nuance from OT/IT differences,
    tools, or phases.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Forensics Tools and Tactics''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Governance Principles > Legal, Regulatory, and
  Compliance > Investigation Requirements > Forensics Tools and Tactics). Generate 25 high-quality flashcards covering DFIR
  concepts, tools (Autopsy, Volatility, Wireshark, EnCase, FTK, dd, FTK Imager), tactics (order of volatility, live/dead acquisition,
  hashing, chain of custody, timeline analysis, data carving), volatile/non-volatile data, OT/IT differences, NIST standards,
  and best practices.


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [REMEMBER: Define terms like volatile data... CREATE: Design toolkit...] Distribute flashcards across
  Bloom''s levels (4-5 per level).

  - Scaffolding: 6-7 cards per layer (Layer 1 Foundation: basics; Layer 2 Components: phases/relationships; Layer 3 Implementation:
  steps/tools; Layer 4 Integration: OT/legal).

  - Active Learning inspiration: Include scenario-based questions mimicking discussion (OT trade-offs), peer-teach (explain
  hashing), problem-solving (triage plans).


  Use exact Flashcard Schema: Output an array of JSON objects as specified. Ensure questions are active/recall-focused, explanations
  scaffolded, distractors rigorous. Base content on research: DFIR phases, chain of custody (SWGDE/NIST), OT challenges, complete
  non-volatile data (HDDs/SSDs/USBs). Make engaging for university-level learners.'
