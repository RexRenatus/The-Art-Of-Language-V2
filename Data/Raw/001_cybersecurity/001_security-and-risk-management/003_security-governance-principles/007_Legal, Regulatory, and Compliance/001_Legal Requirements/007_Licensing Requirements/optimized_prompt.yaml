  discussion_prompt: 'Debate: Is mandatory licensing and certification (e.g., CMMC for DoD contractors or CISSP for professionals)
    necessary for ensuring cybersecurity competence, or is it an overly burdensome regulatory hurdle that stifles innovation?
    Support your position with evidence from NIST standards or real-world compliance failures.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Conceptual (partial truth, e.g., ''self-assessment only'' for CMMC Level 2); 3) Contextual (related framework, e.g.,
    ''ISO 27001'' vs. ''CMMC''). Ensure plausibility from voter consensus errors or research gaps (e.g., truncated CMMC levels).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Licensing Requirements''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Governance Principles > Legal, Regulatory, and
  Compliance > Legal Requirements > Licensing Requirements). Use university-style pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy progression,
  active learning, 4-layer scaffolding (Foundation: terms; Components: frameworks/roles; Implementation: steps; Integration:
  connections/roadmaps).


  Context: Licensing ensures competence in regulated environments like DoD supply chains via CMMC (Levels 1-3 protecting FCI/CUI),
  professional certs (CISSP/CISM), product standards (FIPS 140-2), ISO 27001. Sources: NIST.gov/CMMC, federalregister.gov/documents/2021/11/04/2021-23872,
  HITRUST.org. Concept map: Central ''Licensing'' branches to Certification/Accreditation/Authorization, interlinks to CMMC
  roles (C3PAOs/CCAs), NIST.
