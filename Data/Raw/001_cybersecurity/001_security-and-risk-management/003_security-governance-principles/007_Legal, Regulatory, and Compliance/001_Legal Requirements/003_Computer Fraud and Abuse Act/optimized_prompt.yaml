active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given the Supreme Court’s ruling in Van Buren v. United States (2021), debate whether an IT employee
    accessing a coworker’s files out of personal curiosity exceeds authorized access under CFAA. Use statutory definitions
    from 18 U.S.C. § 1030 and case details to support arguments for both sides.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education (CISSP-aligned: Cybersecurity > Security
  And Risk Management > Security Governance Principles > Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance > Legal Requirements > Computer
  Fraud and Abuse Act). Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema provided. Cover ALL voter priorities:
  full 7 prohibited conducts (§1030(a)(1)-(7)), Van Buren case, penalties, civil provisions.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste array above]

  - Scaffolding: Build flashcards progressively across 4 layers [paste scaffolding array].

  - Active Learning: Link 20% of cards to activities [paste active_learning object].


  Topic Context: CFAA (18 U.S.C. §1030) primary US anti-computer crime law. Key: protected computers (most internet devices),
  auth terms (Van Buren narrows ''exceeds''). Full prohibited list in scaffolding Layer 2.


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards, each: {"front": "...", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "distractors":
