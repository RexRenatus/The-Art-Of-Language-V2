active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how SOX Section 404's ICFR requirements have evolved to address modern
    cybersecurity threats like ransomware. Provide examples of IT controls that bridge financial reporting and cyber risk
    management, referencing real-world cases like the Equifax breach.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse SOX 302 with 404; mix PCAOB/SEC roles)
    - 1-2 highly similar to correct answer (e.g., wrong section number but right description)
    - 1 clearly wrong (e.g., unrelated reg like GDPR)
    - Avoid 'all/none' options; ensure 25-33% chance of random guess correct
    - Reference voter-noted gaps (e.g., tamper-proof records, ITGC)
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in SOX Compliance (Topic Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Governance Principles > Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance > Regulatory
  Compliance > SOX Compliance). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning ideas, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard
  schema to create optimized Anki-style flashcards.


  **Content Sources (Web-Grounded):** SOX (sarbanes-oxley.org, sec.gov/sox), PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 5 (pcaobus.org),
  COSO Framework (coso.org), NIST CSF (nist.gov/cyberframework), examples from Enron/Equifax breaches. Complete details: SOX
  Sections 302/906 (certifications), 404 (ICFR), 802 (penalties for destroying/tampering records, up to 20y prison), 409 (8-K
  real-time filings).


  **Instructions:**

  1. Generate 50 flashcards spanning all Bloom''s levels and scaffolding layers (aim for balance).

  2. Strictly follow flashcard_schema: Each card is a JSON object with ''front'' and ''back'' (including answer, explanation,
  bloom_level, scaffolding_layer, source).

  3. For MCQs: 4 options (A-D), bold correct one in answer; use distractor_protocol.

  4. Ensure active learning tie-ins: Include 5 cards prompting discussion/problem-solving phrasing.

  5. Make explanations pedagogical: Link to objectives, voter consensus (e.g., ITGC testing), prerequisites.

  6. Output ONLY a JSON array of 50 flashcards, no extra text.
