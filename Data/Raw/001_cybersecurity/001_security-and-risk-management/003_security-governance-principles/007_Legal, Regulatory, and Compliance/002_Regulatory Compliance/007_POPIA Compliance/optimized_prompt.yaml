active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the balance between individual privacy rights under POPIA and organizational needs for data processing
    in cybersecurity threat detection. Using a case study of a ransomware data breach affecting customer personal information,
    argue whether the responsible party should notify data subjects and the Information Regulator immediately, or delay for
    investigation. Contrast with GDPR requirements and reference specific POPIA conditions like Security Safeguards and Data
    Subject Participation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1. Common misconception (e.g., confuse POPIA with GDPR timelines);
    2. Partial truth (e.g., correct condition but wrong details); 3. Similar term mix-up (e.g., responsible party vs. operator).
    Ensure distractors are realistic for cybersecurity professionals, avoid obvious errors.'
