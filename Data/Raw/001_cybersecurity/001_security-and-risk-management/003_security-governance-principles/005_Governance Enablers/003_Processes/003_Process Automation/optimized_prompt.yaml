active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent should security processes be automated versus remaining manual? Debate the trade-offs
    in efficiency, error reduction, and potential risks like misconfiguration or lack of adaptability, using CISA's 'Enabling
    Automation in Security Operations' and NIST CSF 2.0 frameworks as references. Support arguments with real-world examples
    like SIEM or SOAR implementations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truth/overstatement (e.g., ''eliminates all errors'' vs. ''reduces''), 3) Unrelated/alternative framework (e.g.,
    mix with ISO 27001). Ensure distractors test nuance from research context and voter priorities.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 25 high-quality MCQ flashcards
  on ''Process Automation'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Governance Principles
  > Governance Enablers > Processes > Process Automation). Integrate university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives [insert
  learning_objectives array here], active learning activities [insert active_learning object here for inspiration], and 4-layer
  scaffolding [insert scaffolding object here].


  Use this research context: Process automation automates repetitive SecOps tasks to reduce errors, boost efficiency (CISA,
  NIST CSF 2.0). Key terms: SecOps, SIEM, SOAR. Examples: Phishing workflows, threat detection. Sources: CISA Enabling Automation
  (https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Enabling%20Automation%20in%20Security%20Operations_Whitepaper_2023.pdf),
  NIST CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/framework).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each strictly following this schema: { "id": 1, "bloom_level": "Remember", "scaffolding_layer":
  "Layer1", "objective_index": 1, "front": "Question?", "options": ["A. Correct", "B. Distractor", "C. Distractor", "D. Distractor"],
  "correct_answer": "A", "explanation": "Rationale + distractor errors + source tie-in." }. Balance coverage: 4-5 cards per
  Bloom''s level, 6 per layer. Distractors: Plausible misconceptions from frameworks/risks. Ensure measurable, active recall.'
