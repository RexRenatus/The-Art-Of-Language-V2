active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using Technology Processing Services (e.g., cost savings
    vs. increased supply chain risks). Use the shared responsibility model in cloud services as a starting point and reference
    NIST CSF 2.0's Govern function to propose mitigation strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Topic: Technology Processing Services (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Governance Principles
  > Governance Enablers > Services, Infrastructure, and Applications > Technology Processing Services). Use this complete
  research context:


  **Core Concepts:** Technology Processing Services are external IT capabilities like Cloud (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS), Managed Services,
  Outsourced Development, System Integration, Data Center Services. Risks: shared responsibility, third-party access, supply
  chain vulnerabilities.


  **Frameworks:** NIST CSF 2.0 Functions: Govern (GV - governance, supply chain), Identify (ID), Protect (PR), Detect (DE),
  Respond (RS), Recover (RC). NIST SP 800-53 (controls, e.g., SA-4, SA-9 for acquisitions), NIST SP 800-161r1 (Cybersecurity
  Supply Chain Risk Management), ISO 27001/27017 (cloud security).


  **Sources:** NIST CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final),
  NIST SP 800-161r1 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/161/r1/upd1/final), NIST IR 8011 Vol 1 (Automation Support for SC RM).


  **Prerequisites:** Basic IT infra (on-prem vs cloud), intro risk mgmt.

  Generate 25 flashcards following the schema: [insert flashcard_schema here]. Output as JSON array of objects, each with
  ''type'', ''front'', ''back'' (with answer, explanation, reference). Ensure measurable, active, scaffolded content for university-level
  pedagogy. Prioritize voter consensus: pedagogy, completeness.'
