active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Using the NICE Framework, debate whether competency definitions should prioritize technical skills or
    also emphasize soft skills like communication and ethics in cybersecurity roles. Provide evidence from real-world breaches
    (e.g., SolarWinds or Equifax) where non-technical competencies failed, and propose a balanced model.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
