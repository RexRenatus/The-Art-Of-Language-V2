active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the pros and cons of using HITRUST CSF versus NIST CSF 2.0 for compliance audits in a healthcare
    organization facing HIPAA requirements. Which is more scalable and why? Consider factors like customization, certification,
    and integration with other regulations like GDPR.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Distractors must be plausible based on voter-noted misconceptions: e.g., ''Compliance audit ensures
    comprehensive security'' (wrong: it focuses on adherence, not full risk mgmt); ''HITRUST CSF is only for healthcare''
    (wrong: covers 60+ sources); ''NIST CSF 2.0 has no Govern function'' (wrong: added in 2.0); real-world traps like Equifax
    (attribute breach solely to ''hacking'' vs. compliance failure). Ensure 1-2 distractors are ''near misses'' from related
    frameworks.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Compliance Audits (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance > Audit, Assessment, and Testing
  > Audit Types and Methodologies > Compliance Audits). Use the provided research context (completed: HITRUST CSF normalizes
  60+ sources like HIPAA, NIST, CCPA, GDPR, PCI DSS; NIST CSF 2.0: Govern/Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover; NIST SP
  800-39: Risk mgmt at organization/mission/system levels; sources: nist.gov, hitrustalliance.net, pci securitystandards.org,
  gdpr.eu; examples: Equifax breach from unpatched systems violating compliance), prior knowledge (basic audits, risk ID,
  compliance basics), and big picture (enables enterprise risk mastery, governance careers).
