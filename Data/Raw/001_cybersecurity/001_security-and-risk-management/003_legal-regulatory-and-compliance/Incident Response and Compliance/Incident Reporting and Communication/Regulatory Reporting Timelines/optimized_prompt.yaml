active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges of complying with overlapping reporting timelines (e.g.,
    CISA 72 hours vs. SEC 4 business days) in a multi-jurisdictional ransomware attack. Propose strategies to prioritize notifications
    and justify using evidence from regulations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in 'Regulatory Reporting Timelines'\
  \ (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance > Incident Response and Compliance\
  \ > Incident Reporting and Communication > Regulatory Reporting Timelines). Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using university\
  \ pedagogy: Bloom's Taxonomy (balance levels), active learning hooks, 4-layer scaffolding (Foundation, Components, Implementation,\
  \ Integration), and prior knowledge from NIST IR lifecycle.\n\nIncorporate this complete content:\n- Definitions: Cyber\
  \ incident, covered cyber incident (CISA), covered entity, notification incident (banking), ransom payment.\n- Timelines\
  \ table: CISA 72h, GDPR 72h, HIPAA 60 days (>500), SEC 4 business days (8-K), CCPA/NY SHIELD varies.\n- Sources: uscode.ecfr.io\
  \ (CISA), ecfr.gov (banking), GDPR Art 33, HIPAA Breach Notification Rule, SEC Cybersecurity Disclosure.\n- Concept map:\
  \ Central 'Regulatory Reporting Timelines' → Definitions/Timelines/Regulators (CISA)/Dependencies (Detection).\n\nLearning\
  \ objectives: [Insert the 6 objectives above].\nScaffolding: [Insert the 4 layers above].\n\nOutput ONLY valid JSON array\
