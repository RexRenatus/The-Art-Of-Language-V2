  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how internal reporting requirements in the NIST CSF 2.0 Govern function
    serve as an oversight mechanism for proactive risk governance. Consider real-world implications for compliance with regulations
    like GDPR and HIPAA, and link to prior knowledge from incident detection—provide examples of when delayed reporting could
    escalate risks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    vs. ''Internal''); 2) Conceptual (partial truth, e.g., wrong NIST function like ''Detect''); 3) Common error (e.g., outdated
    CSF 1.1 without Govern). Ensure distractors test nuance (e.g., timelines, categories). For Q&A, suggest 2-3 common wrong
    answers in explanation.'

  Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives, 4-layer scaffolding, NIST CSF 2.0 completion (Govern function: GV.OC, GV.RM, GV.RR, GV.PO,
  GV.OV; informative refs: ISO 27001, COBIT; examples: CSRR updates), prior knowledge (Detect/Risk Assessment), big picture
  (compliance oversight), related concepts (external reporting, ERM).
