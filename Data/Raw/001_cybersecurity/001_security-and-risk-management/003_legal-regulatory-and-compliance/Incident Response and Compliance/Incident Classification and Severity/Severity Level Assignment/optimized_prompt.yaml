  discussion_prompt: 'Using NIST SP 800-30 guidelines, debate in groups and assign severity levels to two incidents: (1) a
    massive data breach exposing customer PII in a financial firm, versus (2) a targeted DDoS attack disrupting e-commerce
    during peak hours. Consider organizational context, likelihood, impact on CIA triad, and risk exposure—reach consensus
    on prioritization and share rationales.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MC card: (1) Common misconception (e.g., ''CVSS base score directly
    = incident severity'' instead of ''informs prioritization''). (2) Confuse related concepts (e.g., likelihood with impact).
    (3) Edge case/extreme (e.g., ''always critical for any breach'' vs. contextual). Ensure distractors are realistic from
    NIST/CVSS errors or voter-noted pitfalls.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Severity Level Assignment''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance > Incident Response and
  Compliance > Incident Classification and Severity > Severity Level Assignment). Generate 40 high-quality flashcards optimized
  for Anki/Spaced Repetition, covering all Bloom''s levels via these objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE].
  Incorporate active learning hooks (e.g., scenario prompts from discussion/problem-solving). Use 4-layer scaffolding: [INSERT
  scaffolding JSON HERE]—distribute cards progressively (10 per layer). Follow flashcard schema exactly: [INSERT flashcard_schema
  JSON HERE]. Ensure coverage: NIST SP 800-30 (likelihood/impact assessment), CVSS (vuln scoring 0-10), risk = likelihood
  x impact, CIA triad, compliance (GDPR), misconceptions, concept map elements. Output as JSON array: [{''id'':1, ''front'':''...'',
  ''back'':''...'', ''blooms_level'':''APPLY'', ''scaffold_layer'':''2'', ''type'':''MC''}]. Vary difficulty; include 5 CREATE-level
  cards with open-ended design tasks. Ground in research: Risk as uncertainty effect, severity via harm magnitude.'
