  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between reactive incident response (e.g., forensics after
    a breach) and proactive Technology Watch (e.g., monitoring emerging AI-driven threats). Use NIST CSF Functions (Govern,
    Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) to argue which approach better supports long-term compliance in a regulated
    industry like healthcare (HIPAA).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (2) Common misconception (e.g., NIST Tier as ''Basic'' instead of ''Partial''); (3) Overgeneralization (e.g., Tech Watch
    only for threats, ignoring regs). Ensure distractors promote critical thinking via Bloom''s progression.'
