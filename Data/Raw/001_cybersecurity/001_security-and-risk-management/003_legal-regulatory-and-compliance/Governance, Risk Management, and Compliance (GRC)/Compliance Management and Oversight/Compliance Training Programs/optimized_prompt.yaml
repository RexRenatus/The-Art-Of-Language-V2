active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent do compliance training programs truly change employee behavior versus serving as a legal
    checkbox? Debate using examples from NIST SP 800-50 lifecycle stages and metrics for behavior change, referencing real-world
    cases like HIPAA violations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
  additional_activities:
  - Think-pair-share on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Compliance training eliminates all risks').
  - Role-play breach response simulations incorporating training takeaways.

  Incorporate this research context: Compliance training educates on CIA Triad, CPLP (role-based awareness/training/education),
  NIST CSF functions (Identify-Protect-Detect-Respond-Recover-Govern), NIST SP 800-50 lifecycle (Planning: needs analysis;
  Analysis/Design: role-based content; Development/Implementation: delivery methods; Assessment/Improvement: metrics like
  completion rates, knowledge tests, behavior indicators—drives continuous improvement). Metrics include pre/post assessments,
  behavior change. Sources: NIST SP 800-50 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-50.pdf),
  NIST CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework).


  Prior knowledge: CIA Triad, risk basics.
