        "core_logic": "Preventing duplicate accounting is crucial because it ensures accurate tracking and accountability, functioning by assigning unique identifiers to each component. This prevents gaps or overlaps in inventory, which is essential for asset management and security, as per CM-8.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors suggest outcomes contrary to accurate inventory management, such as reducing component count, enabling shared identifiers (a security risk), or focusing on decommissioning over the primary goal of tracking.",
        "analogy": "Preventing duplicate accounting of components is like ensuring each student in a school has a unique ID number; you wouldn't assign the same ID to multiple students, as it would cause confusion and make it impossible to track who is who, impacting attendance, grades, and access."
