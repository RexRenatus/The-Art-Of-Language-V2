active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the role of leadership commitment (Clause 5) in successful ISO/IEC 27001
    implementation. Provide examples of how lack of top-management support could lead to ISMS failure, referencing real-world
    cases like data breaches, and propose mitigation strategies using Annex A controls.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truth (e.g., outdated 2013 control count); 3) Related but incorrect (e.g., NIST-specific term). Ensure distractors
    are web-research grounded (e.g., 114 vs 93 controls). Provide brief explanation for why each distractor is wrong on the
    back.'

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Spaced Repetition using university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (Remember/Understand/Apply/Analyze/Evaluate/Create),
  active learning scaffolding (4 layers: Foundation=CIA/ISMS basics; Components=Clauses 4-10/PDCA/Annex A 93 controls in 4
  themes; Implementation=steps/certification/audits; Integration=GRC role/NIST links/27017-18), prior knowledge (CIA triad,
  risk mgmt), best practices (PDCA, leadership, continual improvement), big picture (certifiable GRC standard), concept map
  (ISMS → CIA/Risk/Annex A).


  Learning Objectives: [Insert the 6 objectives from above].

  Scaffolding: [Insert full scaffolding descriptions].

  Active Learning Integration: Draw from discussion/peer-teaching/problem-solving for scenario-based cards.


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"front": "Question", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "Detailed,
  with clause refs/misconceptions/Bloom level/layer/hierarchy", "distractors": [array of 3 for MCQs with why-wrong explanations]}}.


  Flashcard Schema: [Insert full schema]. Strictly: Exactly 3 distractors/MCQ; realistic/web-grounded (27001:2022 facts: 93
  controls, 4 themes, new threat intel/cloud); cover all layers/objectives evenly; no adult/offensive content.'
