active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent do vendor security scorecards mitigate supply chain risks, and what limitations do they
    have compared to full audits or continuous monitoring? Debate in groups using NIST CSF GV.SC as a framework, and vote
    on whether organizations should prioritize scorecards for all vendors or only Tier 1 critical suppliers.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    vs. ''complement audits''), 2) Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Only for Tier 1 vendors'' vs. ''All supply chain
    tiers''), 3) Confusable term (e.g., ''SCRM'' mixed with ''general CRM''). Ensure distractors test nuance from NIST frameworks
    and voter priorities (e.g., limitations vs. full audits).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Vendor Security Scorecards
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance > GRC > SCRM > Vendor
  Security Scorecards). Synthesize high-quality Anki-style flashcards using university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives,
  4-layer scaffolding, active learning prompts, and web-grounded context (NIST CSF 2.0 GV.SC, NIST SP 800-161 Rev. 1: lifecycle
  mgmt, risk assessment, controls; post-SolarWinds emphasis; GRC maturity).


  Core Content: Vendor Security Scorecard = standardized cybersecurity evaluation tool for vendors. Key frameworks: NIST CSF
  2.0 Govern (GV.SC for supply chain), SP 800-161 Rev. 1. SCRM/C-SCRM processes. Sources: NIST docs.

  Generate 75 flashcards: Balance Bloom''s (per objectives), layers. 20% MCQ w/ distractor protocol (plausible misconceptions).
  Cover voter priorities: completeness (NIST SP 800-161), pedagogy (progression), active learning (SolarWinds exercise, discussion).
