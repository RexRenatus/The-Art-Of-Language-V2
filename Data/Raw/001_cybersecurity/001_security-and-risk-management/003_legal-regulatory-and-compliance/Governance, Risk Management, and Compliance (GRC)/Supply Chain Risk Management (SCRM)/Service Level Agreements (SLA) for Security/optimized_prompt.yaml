active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a shared responsibility model like cloud computing (e.g., AWS or Azure), to what extent should SecSLAs
    hold Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) accountable for client misconfigurations? Debate with evidence from NIST SP 800-174
    and other frameworks, considering risk transfer in SCRM.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, explain SecSLA components (SLI, SLO, QoS) using a real CSP example like AWS Well-Architected Framework
    or Azure Security SLAs; switch roles for teach-back and quiz each other on misconceptions (e.g., SLAs only cover availability,
    not security/privacy).
  problem_solving: Given a supply chain scenario (e.g., third-party SaaS vendor breach impacting compliance), design SecSLA
    clauses for incident response (MTTR), uptime (99.95% security controls availability), and compliance reporting; think-pair-share
    solutions and role-play negotiation between client and provider.

  **Research Context (Complete):** Core Concepts: SLA (contract for service metrics); SecSLA (security-focused, for CSPs);
  SLI (metric); SLO (target); QoS (performance incl. security); Shared responsibility in cloud. Standards: NIST SP 800-174
  (''A Security Service Level Agreement (SecSLA) Template for Cloud Services'' – templates for controls like audit, incident
  response, SLIs/SLOs); ISO 27001 (ISMS controls); CSA STAR/CCM (cloud metrics, registry). Best Practices: Risk-based SLOs
  (e.g., 99.9% log availability, MTTR<4h), penalties, audits. Real-world: AWS/Azure CSP SLAs. Sources: NIST SP 800-174 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-174.pdf);
  ISO 27001; CSA STAR (https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/).


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Align flashcards to these Learning Objectives [insert array above]. Use Scaffolding Layers [insert
  scaffolding above] for progression. Incorporate Active Learning [insert active_learning above] via scenario-based questions.
  Prior knowledge: ITIL SLAs, basic risk mgmt. Big Picture: SecSLAs transfer risk in GRC/SCRM.


  **Task:** Generate 25 high-quality flashcards covering all objectives/layers balanced per schema. Use exact Flashcard Schema
  [insert schema above]. Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''references'': ''...''}, ''metadata'': {...}}, ...]. Ensure active recall, distractors teach, explanations reference standards/examples.
  No duplicates; vary phrasing for retention.'
