active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the optimal frequency of cybersecurity training refreshers (annual vs. quarterly or event-driven).
    Consider factors like threat evolution, regulatory requirements (e.g., NIST), and organizational size. Provide evidence
    from NIST SP 800-50r1 and share personal or hypothetical examples of impacts on security culture.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Use Flashcard Schema exactly: Front (question + A-D options), Back (correct answer, explanation with Bloom''s level/scaffolding
  layer/reference/active learning link, distractor rationale). Ensure progression: 8 foundational (Layers 1-2, lower Bloom''s),
  10 implementation (Layer 3, Apply/Analyze), 7 integration (Layer 4, Evaluate/Create). Distractors from misconceptions (e.g.,
  no metrics needed). Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''correct_answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
