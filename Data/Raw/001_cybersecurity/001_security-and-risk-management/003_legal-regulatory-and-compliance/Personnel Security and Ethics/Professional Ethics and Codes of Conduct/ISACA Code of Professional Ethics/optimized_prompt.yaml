active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Analyze a real-world cybersecurity breach (e.g., Equifax data breach) through the lens of ISACA's confidentiality
    principle. Should auditors disclose findings publicly if it serves the public interest? Debate the pros and cons, citing
    specific principles like confidentiality, objectivity, and stakeholder interests.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors from voter-suggested misconceptions: over-transparency (confuses disclosure),
    personal gain, minimal effort (e.g., ''learn on job''), delegation myths, illegal vs. unethical. Make plausible for cybersecurity
    pros (e.g., audit pressure, breach handling).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ISACA certifications. Generate
  high-quality, pedagogically optimized flashcards for the topic: **ISACA Code of Professional Ethics** (Category: Cybersecurity;
  Domain: Security And Risk Management; Subdomain: Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance; Entry Domain: Personnel Security and
  Ethics; Entry Subdomain: Professional Ethics and Codes of Conduct). Topic Hierarchy: Level 1: Cybersecurity > Level 2: Security
  And Risk Management > ... > Level 6: ISACA Code of Professional Ethics.


  **Core Content**: ISACA Code guides ethical conduct in IT governance, risk, cybersecurity, assurance. Key principles: 1.
  Support/implement standards for governance/management. 2. Perform duties with objectivity, due care, diligence. 3. Serve
  stakeholders lawfully/ethically. 4. Maintain privacy/confidentiality (unless legally compelled; no personal gain). 5. Maintain
  competency (and others per official list). Emphasize 84.3% voter-approved focus: misconceptions, scenarios, links to COBIT/NIST/GDPR/SOX.


  **Incorporate**:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert the learning_objectives array here verbatim].

  - Scaffolding: Generate cards across 4 layers: [insert scaffolding object here verbatim].

  - Active Learning: Ensure cards support activities like [summarize briefly: discussions on Equifax, peer teaching principles,
  dilemma-solving].

  - Prior Knowledge: Basic ethics, IT governance, Personnel Security.

  - Big Picture: Essential for CISA/CRISC, ethical incidents, trust-building.


  **Output exactly**: A JSON array of flashcards strictly following this schema: [insert flashcard_schema.structure here].
  Total: 50-100 cards. Cover all principles evenly, test misconceptions (e.g., confidentiality ≠ proactive disclosure). Use
  research context: Uphold fairness, honesty, competence [cite isaca.org]. Balance Bloom''s (evenly), layers (20/30/30/20%),
  types (60% MCQ w/ 3 distractors, etc.). Explanations: Tie to objectives, provide formative feedback, real-world cybersecurity
  examples. No extra text outside JSON.'
