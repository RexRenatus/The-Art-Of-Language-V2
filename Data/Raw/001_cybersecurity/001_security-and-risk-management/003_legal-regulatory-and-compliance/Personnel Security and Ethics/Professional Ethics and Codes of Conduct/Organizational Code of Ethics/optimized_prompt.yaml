  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the following: ''Should cybersecurity professionals prioritize organizational
    loyalty or public good when discovering a vulnerability that could harm users? Use tenets from the IEEE or ACM Code of
    Ethics to support your position, and consider stakeholder impacts.'' Encourage participants to reference real-world examples
    like the Equifax breach.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truths (e.g., IEEE prioritizes employer over public); 3) Cybersecurity specifics (e.g., vulnerability disclosure

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Organizational Code of\
  \ Ethics (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance > Personnel\
