active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss common misconceptions about data sanitization (e.g., 'Deleting files or formatting a drive permanently
    removes data') and explain how NIST SP 800-88 counters them with evidence-based methods like Purge or Destroy. Share real-world
    examples from news breaches and debate enterprise implications.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these exactly:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the full array above]

  - Active Learning: Use elements to inspire questions (e.g., misconception scenarios from discussion, peer-quiz styles, problem-solving
  cases).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers (aim 12-13 per layer, progressive difficulty). Start with Layer 1 basics,
  build to Layer 4 integration.

  - Voter Priorities: High accuracy (cite NIST Rev. 1 2014 as current; Rev. 2 Sep 2025 final/draft—link csrc.nist.gov); completeness
  (cover Clear/Purge/Destroy, media types HDD/SSD, DoD 5220.22-M, FIPS 199); pedagogy (Bloom''s verbs, examples).
