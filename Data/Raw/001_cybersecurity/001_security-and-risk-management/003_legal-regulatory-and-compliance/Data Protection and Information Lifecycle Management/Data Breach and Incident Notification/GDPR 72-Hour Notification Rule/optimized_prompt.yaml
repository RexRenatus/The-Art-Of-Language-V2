active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether the 72-hour rule strikes the right balance between rapid response and
    practical feasibility for organizations. Use real-world examples like the British Airways breach (delayed notification
    leading to £20M fine) and consider exceptions for low-risk breaches or encrypted data.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    1 related but wrong concept (e.g., ''PCI-DSS 24-hour rule''), 1 edge case reversal (e.g., ''notification only for high
    risk to subjects''). Ensure plausibility from voter/research context (e.g., truncated exceptions).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in GDPR compliance. Generate
  25 high-quality flashcards on the ''GDPR 72-Hour Notification Rule'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk
  Management > Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance > Data Protection and Information Lifecycle Management > Data Breach and
  Incident Notification > GDPR 72-Hour Notification Rule).


  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives** (Bloom''s): [REMEMBER: Define breach/roles]; [UNDERSTAND: Explain rule/exceptions]; [APPLY: Classify
  scenarios]; [ANALYZE: Compare obligations]; [EVALUATE: Assess delays/consequences e.g., British Airways £20M, Uber €290M];
  [CREATE: Design procedures].

  - **Scaffolding Layers**: Layer 1 (definitions), Layer 2 (roles/rule components/exceptions: no notif if unlikely risk, Art34
  high risk), Layer 3 (notification process/content), Layer 4 (IRP integration/fines/cross-border).

  - **Active Learning Context**: Tie cards to discussion (debate balance), peer-teaching (roles), problem-solving (cases).

  - **Content Completeness**: Personal data breach (Art4(12), subtypes); controller/processor; 72h from awareness; exceptions
  (low/no risk, encrypted); notification facts/risks/mitigation; sources: gdpr-info.eu/art-33, gdprlocal.com, thoropass.com.

  - **Big Picture**: Timely reporting in data lifecycle minimizes harm/accountability.


  **Output Format**: JSON array of objects, each: {''type'': ''basic|mcq|cloze'', ''bloom_level'': ''REMEMBER|etc'', ''layer'':
  1-4, ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''... (ref objective/layer/case)'', ''source'':
  ''...''}}, ''distractors'': [...] for MCQ}.

  Follow flashcard schema strictly: Use distractor protocol for MCQs. Ensure progressive difficulty, active recall, spaced
  repetition friendly. No adult/offensive content.'
