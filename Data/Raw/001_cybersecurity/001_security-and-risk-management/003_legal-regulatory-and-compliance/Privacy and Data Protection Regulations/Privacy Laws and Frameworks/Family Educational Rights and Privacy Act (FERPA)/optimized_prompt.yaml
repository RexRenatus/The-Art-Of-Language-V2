  discussion_prompt: 'Analyze this scenario: A university shares student health data with a research firm claiming ''legitimate
    educational interest.'' Is this FERPA-compliant? Compare to GDPR requirements for international students and discuss cybersecurity
    implications like encryption needs. Support your analysis with specific FERPA exceptions and provisions.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
