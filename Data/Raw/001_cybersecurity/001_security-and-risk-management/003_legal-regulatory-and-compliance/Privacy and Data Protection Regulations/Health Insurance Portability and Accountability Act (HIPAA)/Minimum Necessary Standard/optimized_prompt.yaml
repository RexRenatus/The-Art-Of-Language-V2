active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a hospital setting, a nurse needs to consult a pharmacist about a patient's medication. Should the
    nurse share the full patient history or only the relevant allergy info? Debate the boundaries of the Minimum Necessary
    Standard, potential risks of over-sharing (e.g., increased breach exposure), and exceptions like treatment disclosures
    among providers. Consider misconceptions, such as assuming it applies to patient-requested disclosures.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
