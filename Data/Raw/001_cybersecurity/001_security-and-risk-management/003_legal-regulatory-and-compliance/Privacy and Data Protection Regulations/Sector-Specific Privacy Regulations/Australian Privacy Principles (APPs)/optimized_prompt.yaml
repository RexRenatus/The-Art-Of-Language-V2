  discussion_prompt: In a debate format, argue whether APP 2 (anonymity and pseudonymity) is feasible for e-commerce platforms
    handling financial transactions. Provide examples and counterarguments using real-world cases like online shopping data
    breaches (e.g., referencing OAIC investigations).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''APPs apply only
    to gov'' vs. APP entities); 2) Similar APPs (e.g., confuse APP3 collection with APP6 use); 3) Edge cases/exceptions (e.g.,
    ''Always need consent'' ignoring secondary purposes); 4) Real-world errors from OAIC cases. Ensure distractors are realistic
    to test understanding.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Australian Privacy Principles
  (APPs) under Privacy Act 1988. Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance
  > Privacy and Data Protection Regulations > Sector-Specific Privacy Regulations > Australian Privacy Principles (APPs).
  Voter consensus: 84.3% approval, prioritize completeness of all 13 APPs.


  **Full Research Context (Complete 13 APPs):** APPs govern APP entities (gov agencies + private orgs >$3M turnover) handling
  personal information (info about identified individuals; sensitive subset: health/race/etc.). Principles by lifecycle:

  1. APP1: Open/transparent management – privacy policy, publicly available.

  2. APP2: Anonymity/pseudonymity – offer where lawful/practicable.

  3. APP3: Solicited collection – necessary, lawful/fair, consent for sensitive.

  4. APP4: Unsolicited – assess/retain only if reasonable, else destroy.

  5. APP5: Notification – inform of collection, purposes, contacts.

  6. APP6: Use/disclosure – primary purpose or consented/necessary related.

  7. APP7: Direct marketing – consent or easy opt-out.

  8. APP8: Cross-border – ensure overseas recipient protected or exceptions.

  9. APP9: Govt identifiers – don''t adopt/use/disclose as own ID unless essential.

  10. APP10: Quality – accurate/complete/up-to-date/relevant.

  11. APP11: Security – protect from misuse/loss/unauth access; destroy EOL.

  12. APP12: Access – provide on request unless exceptions.

  13. APP13: Correction – amend inaccurate info, notify recipients.


  **Concept Map (Text):** APPS (center) -> Collection (1-5) -> Use/Disclosure (6-9) -> Management (10-11) -> Access/Correction
  (12-13). Dependencies: APP1 informs all; APP11 cross-cuts.
