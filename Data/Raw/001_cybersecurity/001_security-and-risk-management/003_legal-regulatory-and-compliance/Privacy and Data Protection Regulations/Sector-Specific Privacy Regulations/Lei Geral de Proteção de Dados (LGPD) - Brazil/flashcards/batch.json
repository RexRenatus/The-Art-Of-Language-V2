        "core_logic": "The LGPD outlines several legal bases for processing personal data beyond consent, such as fulfilling legal duties, protecting vital interests, or pursuing legitimate interests that do not override data subject rights. This multi-basis approach allows for necessary data processing while maintaining safeguards, because relying solely on consent would hinder essential operations like law enforcement or public health.",

The exemptions listed in Article 4 are specific and generally relate to public interest, security, or purely private activities, because broad marketing exceptions could undermine individual privacy rights.",
