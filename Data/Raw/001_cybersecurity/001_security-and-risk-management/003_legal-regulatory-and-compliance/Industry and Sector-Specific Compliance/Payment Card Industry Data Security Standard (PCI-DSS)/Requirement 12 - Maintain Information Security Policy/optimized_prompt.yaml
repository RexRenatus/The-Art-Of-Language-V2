active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the consequences of failing to maintain an up-to-date Information Security
    Policy under PCI-DSS Req 12 (e.g., fines, breaches). Use real-world examples like the Target breach to support arguments
    and propose mitigation strategies tied to sub-requirements 12.1 and 12.10.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
