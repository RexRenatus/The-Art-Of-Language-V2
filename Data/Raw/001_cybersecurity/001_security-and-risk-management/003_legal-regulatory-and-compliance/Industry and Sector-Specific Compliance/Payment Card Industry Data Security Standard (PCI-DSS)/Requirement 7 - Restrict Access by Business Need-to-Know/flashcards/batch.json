        "core_logic": "PCI DSS Requirement 7's 'need-to-know' principle is exemplified by granting a customer service representative access only to necessary data (name, last four PAN digits) because this limits exposure, unlike granting full PAN/CVV access or broad administrative access to sensitive data.",

        }
      ],
      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The principle of 'separation of duties' is intrinsically linked to PCI DSS Requirement 7 because it functions as a critical control within access management, ensuring that critical functions involving cardholder data are divided among multiple individuals, thereby preventing a single person from having end-to-end control and mitigating fraud or error.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors misrepresent the relationship: claiming it's a separate requirement, limiting its scope to physical access, or downplaying its importance as a mere recommendation, when it's a foundational concept for effective access control under Requirement 7.",
