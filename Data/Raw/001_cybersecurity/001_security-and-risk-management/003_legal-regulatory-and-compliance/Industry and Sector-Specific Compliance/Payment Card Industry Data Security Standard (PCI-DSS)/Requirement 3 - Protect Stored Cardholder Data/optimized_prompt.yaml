active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using encryption versus tokenization for protecting stored
    CHD in a high-volume e-commerce environment. Consider costs, performance impacts, compliance ease, and breach scenarios.
    Reference PCI DSS sub-requirements 3.4–3.6 and real-world examples like the Target breach.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert PCI DSS flashcard generator. Use the following to create 50 high-quality flashcards for
  ''Requirement 3: Protect Stored Cardholder Data'' (PCI-DSS, Cybersecurity > Security & Risk Mgmt > Legal/Regulatory/Compliance
  > Industry Compliance > PCI-DSS > Req 3).


  **Context:** PCI DSS Req 3 mandates CHD protection via limits, no SAD storage, PAN masking/unreadability (truncate/encrypt/tokenize/hash),
  key protection. Sub-reqs: 3.1–3.7. Big picture: One of 12 reqs; prereqs Req 1–2. Sources: PCI DSS v4.0/v3.2.1.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list above].

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full layers above].

  **Active Learning:** Draw from discussions/problems for scenario cards.


  **Generate per Flashcard Schema:** [Insert full schema above]. Ensure progression: 10 cards Layer 1 (Remember/Understand),
  15 Layer 2 (Understand/Analyze), 15 Layer 3 (Apply/Analyze), 10 Layer 4 (Evaluate/Create). Balance Bloom''s. Distractors
  from misconceptions (CHD=SAD, truncation sufficient). Output ONLY as JSON array of flashcards.'
