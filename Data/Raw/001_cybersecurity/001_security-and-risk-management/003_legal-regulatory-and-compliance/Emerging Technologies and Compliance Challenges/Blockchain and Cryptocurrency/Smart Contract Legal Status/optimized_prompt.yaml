active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a post-DAO hack world, should smart contracts be granted full legal enforceability equivalent to traditional
    contracts, or do they require hybrid regulatory frameworks? Argue with pros, cons, and real-world examples from different
    jurisdictions (e.g., US, EU), addressing misconceptions about immutability implying legality.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert array above]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert scaffolding descriptions above] – Distribute cards: 3-5 per layer, progressing from foundation
  to integration.

  - Active Learning: Draw from discussion/problem-solving for scenario-based cards.

  - Research Context: Smart contracts (self-executing code on DLT); smart legal contracts (binding with code); challenges
  (traditional law applicability: capacity, duress, fraud, mandatory rules; jurisdiction, enforceability, DAO hack); compliance
  (GDPR, AML/KYC). Sources: mondaq.com, sciencedirect.com, rapidinnovation.io.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly:

  - Types: Q&A, MCQ (4 opts), Cloze.

  - Distractors: Plausible misconceptions.

  - Explanations: Answer + Bloom''s/layer/objective link + distractor rationale + real-world tie-in + source.

  ''...'', ''back'': ''...''}]. Ensure active learning integration (e.g., DAO scenarios) and voter priorities (e.g., hybrid
  contracts, case studies).'
