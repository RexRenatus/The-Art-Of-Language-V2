  discussion_prompt: 'Debate: ''Crypto''s pseudonymity makes full AML compliance impossible.'' Divide into teams: Propose
    arguments for/against, using FATF standards and real-world cases (e.g., Binance fines). Synthesize class consensus on
    balanced compliance approaches.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following the exact schema:

  1. Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'':
  ''...'', ''source'': ''...''}]

  2. Balance: 5 Remember/Understand, 7 Apply/Analyze, 7 Evaluate, 6 Create.

  3. Distractors: Strictly follow protocol – misconceptions like crypto anonymity.

  4. University pedagogy: Scaffolded, active recall, spaced repetition friendly.

  5. Ensure traceability: Cite sources in every card.
