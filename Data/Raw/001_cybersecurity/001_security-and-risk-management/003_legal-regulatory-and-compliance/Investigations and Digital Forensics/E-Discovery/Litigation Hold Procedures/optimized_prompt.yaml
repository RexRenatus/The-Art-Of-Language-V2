  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student role-plays a custodian receiving a litigation hold notice during a simulated cyber
    breach, while the other explains the process, responsibilities, and consequences of non-compliance; switch roles and debrief
    on misconceptions like assuming holds only apply post-lawsuit filing.
  problem_solving: Given a real-world cyber breach scenario (e.g., a phishing-induced data leak via email, similar to the
    Equifax breach), identify relevant ESI sources (emails, logs, backups), preserve chain of custody, and draft a sample
    hold notice; evaluate potential spoliation risks and quantify fine exposure (e.g., millions in sanctions).

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs: 1. Common misconception (e.g., ''Litigation hold only after
    lawsuit filing''); 2. Related but incorrect term (e.g., ''Records retention'' vs. ''Legal hold''); 3. Real-world pitfall
    (e.g., from spoliation cases like ''Ignore backups as non-ESI''). Base on voter suggestions, research (ESI scope), and
    ensure 70% plausibility to test deep understanding.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Litigation Hold Procedures
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance > Investigations and
  Digital Forensics > E-Discovery > Litigation Hold Procedures). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards using university pedagogy:
  Bloom''s Taxonomy (cover all 6 levels progressively), active learning, 4-layer scaffolding, and best practices (spaced repetition,
  active recall).


  **Core Content Sources:** Use provided research (definitions: litigation hold, ESI, spoliation, custodian, trigger event;
  Sedona guidelines; spoliation risks/sanctions); voter consensus (82.9% approval: real-world cases like Equifax/Qualcomm,
  prior links to NIST IR/data retention); big picture (prevents sanctions in incident lifecycle).


  **Learning Objectives (Integrate):** [REMEMBER: Define terms... ] [Full list as above].


  **Scaffolding (Distribute evenly):** Layer 1 Foundation (10 cards: basics); Layer 2 Components (15 cards); Layer 3 Implementation
  (15 cards); Layer 4 Integration (10 cards).


  **Active Learning Ties:** End 20% of explanations with prompts from [discussion/peer_teaching/problem_solving as above].


  **Flashcard Format (JSON Array):** [{''front'': ''Question [BLOOM LEVEL]'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''measurable_outcome'': ''...''}}, ...]. Use schema:
  varied Q types, distractors per protocol.


  Ensure completeness: Prior knowledge (incident response), measurable (90% metrics), engagement (cases), progression (low-to-high
  Bloom''s). Output only the JSON array of 50 flashcards.'
