active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between forensic readiness in resource-constrained IoT devices and privacy concerns
    in heterogeneous ecosystems. Which challenges (e.g., data volume/velocity, encryption) are most critical and why? Support
    with real-world examples like the Mirai botnet.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

    rules:
    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs based on common misconceptions (e.g., for ''heterogeneous ecosystems'': ''All
      IoT devices use standard protocols'' vs. correct ''Diverse hardware/software/protocols'').'
    - 'Draw from challenges: Mix-up resource constraints with data volume; privacy with volatility.'
    - Ensure distractors are realistic (e.g., outdated tools, ignored legal aspects) but identifiable via explanation.
    - Avoid trivial errors; promote critical thinking.

  **Research Context (Completed):** IoT Device Forensics involves collection, preservation, analysis, and reporting of evidence
  from IoT ecosystems. Core concepts: IoT (networked devices), Digital Forensics (evidence gathering), IoT Forensics Readiness
  (preparedness), Weaponized IoT (botnets like Mirai), Constrained Devices (limited resources), Heterogeneous Ecosystems (diverse
  protocols: MQTT, CoAP, Zigbee).


  **Challenges (Completed):** 1. Heterogeneity (varied hardware/OS); 2. Resource Constraints (low memory/power); 3. Data Volume
  and Velocity (massive real-time streams); 4. Encryption/Proprietary Protocols (access barriers); 5. Data Volatility (RAM/ephemeral
  storage); 6. Legal/Privacy Issues (GDPR compliance); 7. Lack of Standardization (no uniform tools).


  **Big Picture:** Contributes to regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR IoT breaches) and cybersecurity against emerging threats.
