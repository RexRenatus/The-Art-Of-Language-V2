  **Research Context (Complete):** Cloud forensics applies digital forensics to cloud environments, addressing challenges
  like multi-tenancy, data ephemerality, jurisdiction (e.g., CLOUD Act), and shared responsibility. NIST SP 800-201 (Cloud
  Computing Forensic Reference Architecture - CCFRA): Defines actors (forensic investigator, CSP, customer), activities (planning,
  collection, examination), and functional components for readiness. NISTIR 8006 (Cloud Computing Forensic Science): Details
  challenges (volatility, anti-forensics) and proposes architecture with preparation, live acquisition via APIs (e.g., AWS
  CloudTrail), and hybrid analysis. Other: ENISA guidelines on cloud evidence handling. Sources: nist.gov/sp-800-201, nist.gov/nistir/8006,
  csrc.nist.gov.


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Align to Bloom''s objectives [insert learning_objectives array]. Use scaffolding layers [insert
  scaffolding.layers]. Prior knowledge: Digital forensics basics, cloud models.


  **Active Learning Tie-in:** Cards should prompt recall for discussions (e.g., challenges) or problem-solving (e.g., scenarios).


  **Generate 50 flashcards using schema [insert flashcard_schema]:**

  - Balance: 10/Layer, span Bloom''s.

  - Output JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''blooms_level'': ''...'',
  ''layer'': 1, ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'', ''opt3'']}}]

  - High-quality: Precise, educational, misconception-busting. Varied formats.'
