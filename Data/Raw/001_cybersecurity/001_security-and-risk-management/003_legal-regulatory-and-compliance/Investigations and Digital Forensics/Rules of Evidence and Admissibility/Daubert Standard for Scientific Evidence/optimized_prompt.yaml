active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'Debate whether a forensic tool X (e.g., controversial digital imaging software) meets the Daubert factors
    for reliability in a cybercrime trial. Divide into groups: proponents (argue for admissibility) vs. challengers (argue
    against), citing specific factors and real-world examples.'
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains the five Daubert factors using a digital forensics example (e.g., chain of
    custody in evidence handling); the partner teaches it back and critiques potential weaknesses in application.
  problem_solving: 'Analyze a real-world case (e.g., hash analysis in a malware investigation from a cybersecurity breach).
    Role-play as the judge: decide on admissibility based on Daubert criteria, justifying with at least three factors and
    providing a written ruling.'

    with Frye (overemphasizing general acceptance), misstating factors (e.g., ''widespread rejection'' instead of acceptance),
    inverting roles (defense as gatekeeper), or outdated FRE 702 phrasing. Ensure distractors are realistic for cybersecurity/forensics

  Core Content (Web-grounded): Daubert Standard (Daubert v. Merrell Dow, 1993) requires judges as ''gatekeepers'' for relevant
  + reliable expert testimony, superseding Frye. FRE 702: Qualified expert testimony based on sufficient facts/data, reliable
  principles/methods, reliably applied to case facts. 5 Flexible Factors: 1. Testability; 2. Peer review/publication; 3. Error
  rate; 4. Standards; 5. General acceptance. Trilogy: Daubert, Joiner (discretion), Kumho (non-scientific). Cybersecurity
  relevance: Admissibility of forensics tools (e.g., hash analysis).
