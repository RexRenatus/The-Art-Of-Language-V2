        "core_logic": "The Convention on Cybercrime is significant because it provides a foundational international legal framework that requires signatory nations to criminalize key computer offenses and cooperate in investigations, thereby enabling a more unified global response to cybercrime. It functions by setting common standards and facilitating mutual legal assistance treaties, because cybercrime transcends national borders.",

        "analogy": "The Convention is like an international agreement for extradition: it sets rules for how countries can work together to catch and prosecute criminals who cross borders, rather than creating a single international police force."
