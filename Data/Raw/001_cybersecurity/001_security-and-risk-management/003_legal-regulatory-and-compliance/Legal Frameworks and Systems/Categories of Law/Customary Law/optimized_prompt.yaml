  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the following: ''To what extent do current international cyber norms,
    as outlined in the Tallinn Manual, constitute binding customary international law? Provide evidence from state practices
    and opinio juris, and consider challenges in enforcement within cybersecurity contexts.'' Encourage participants to reference
    real-world cyber incidents like state-sponsored attacks.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Semantically similar: Swap elements (e.g., ''state practice'' distractor as ''treaty ratification'').'
    - 'Contextual traps: Cyber-specific (e.g., ''NIST framework'' as customary law source vs. voluntary standard).'
    - 'Frequency-based: 1 semi-correct (partial truth), 1 opposite, 1 unrelated.'
    - 'Avoid randomness: Ground in real confusions from international law (e.g., persistence vs. generality of practice).'

  **Core Content Summary (Web-Grounded Synthesis):** Customary law is unwritten international law from consistent state practice
  (general, consistent, representative) plus opinio juris (acceptance as obligatory; ICJ Statute Art. 38(1)(b)). In cybersecurity:
  Applies where no treaties exist; e.g., sovereignty, non-intervention, due diligence (Tallinn Manual 2.0 Rules 1-4, 6). Industry
  customs (e.g., best practices) as de facto norms for compliance. Examples: State responses to WannaCry (due diligence);
  emerging norms via UN GGE. Challenges: Ambiguity, slow evolution vs. rapid cyber threats.
