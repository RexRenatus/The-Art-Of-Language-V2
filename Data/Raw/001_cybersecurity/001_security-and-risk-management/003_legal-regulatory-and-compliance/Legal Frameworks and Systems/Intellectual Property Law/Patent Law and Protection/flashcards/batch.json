This date is typically the date the application was filed, but can be earlier if priority is claimed from a prior application, ensuring that only genuinely new and non-obvious inventions are patented.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly equate the effective filing date with the grant date, conception date, or public disclosure date, all of which are distinct and have different legal implications.",
