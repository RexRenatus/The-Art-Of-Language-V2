active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of cybersecurity, debate whether a phishing site using a slightly altered version of a
    company's service mark (e.g., 'Goog1e' vs. 'Google') constitutes infringement under the Lanham Act. Consider factors like
    consumer confusion, use in commerce, and mark distinctiveness. Provide real-world examples like typosquatting and discuss
    implications for digital risk management.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    1. Partial truths (e.g., ''Domain registration grants trademark rights'' vs. reality: no, needs use in commerce)

    2. Confusions between terms (e.g., trademark vs. service mark; Principal vs. Supplemental Register)

    3. Cybersecurity-specific errors (e.g., ''Phishing always requires exact mark copy'' vs. likelihood of confusion)

    Ensure distractors are plausible to educated learners but incorrect per law.'

  **Topic Hierarchy:** Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance > Legal Frameworks
  and Systems > Intellectual Property Law > Trademark and Service Mark Protection.


  **Comprehensive Research Context (Complete Summary):**

  - **Core Concepts:** Trademark: Identifies goods source. Service Mark: Identifies services source (e.g., titles, program
  features). Brand: Marketing perception. IP: Includes patents/copyrights. Domain Name: No auto TM rights. Trade Name: Business
  name, can be TM if source-indicating. Related Company: Controlled use benefits owner. Use in Commerce: Bona fide ordinary
  trade use (goods tagged, services advertised/sold interstate).

  - **Registers:** Principal: Distinctive marks; benefits: validity presumption, nationwide priority, notice, incontestability
  (5 yrs). Supplemental: Descriptive/weak marks; benefits: later conflicting app bar, path to Principal via secondary meaning;
  no prima facie rights.

  - **Infringement:** Lanham Act §32: Likelihood of confusion (Sleekcraft factors: strength/similarity/proximity/channels/confusion
  evidence). Abandonment: 3+ yrs nonuse + no resume intent.

  - **Enforcement:** Cease-desist, suits, UDRP (bad faith domains), ACPA (cybersquatting). Cybersecurity: Phishing/typosquatting
  (e.g., ''FireWallPro.net'' malware site), brand risk mgmt.

  - **International/Best Practices:** Madrid Protocol (WIPO int''l filings). Monitor domains, register key marks, use TM®/SM™,
  watch services.

  **Sources:** USPTO.gov/trademarks/basics; 15 USC §1051 (Lanham Act); WIPO.int/udrp; icann.org/resources/pages/help/dndr/udrp-en.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives from above].

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers from above].

  **Active Learning Prep:** Flashcards should scaffold discussions (e.g., confusion factors), peer teaching (e.g., term diffs),
  problem-solving (e.g., scenarios).


  **Task:** Generate 40 high-quality flashcards (10 per scaffolding layer) aligned to objectives/Bloom''s. 50% cloze (Layer
  1-2), 50% MCQ (Layer 3-4). Ensure cybersecurity relevance (e.g., phishing examples). Strictly follow the flashcard_schema
  structure. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards.'
