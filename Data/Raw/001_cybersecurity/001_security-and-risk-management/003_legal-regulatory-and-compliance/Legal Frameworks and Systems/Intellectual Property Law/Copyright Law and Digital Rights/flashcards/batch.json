        "core_logic": "A copyright notice (17 U.S.C. § 401) serves as a public declaration that a work is protected by copyright, identifying the owner and the year of first publication. While not mandatory for works published after March 1, 1989, it provides practical benefits by informing potential users and potentially preventing innocent infringement defenses, thereby supporting the copyright holder's rights.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly suggest the notice relinquishes copyright, grants free usage, or is a mandatory registration step, all misrepresenting its function as an informative assertion of copyright ownership.",
        "analogy": "A copyright notice is like a 'Private Property' sign on land. It doesn't grant permission to enter, nor does it mean the land is now public. It simply informs everyone that the property is owned and protected, deterring unauthorized access."

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Copyright law (17 U.S.C. § 102(b)) protects the expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves. Therefore, a novel, song, or computer program's source code, which are expressions fixed in a tangible medium, are copyrightable. However, an abstract idea, like the concept for a social media platform, remains unprotected by copyright, as it lacks specific expression.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors represent common categories of copyrightable works (literary, musical, computer programs), while the correct answer identifies an abstract idea, which copyright law explicitly excludes from protection.",
        "analogy": "Copyright law protects the specific words in a book (the expression), but not the underlying plot idea (the idea). Similarly, it protects the specific code of a computer program, but not the general concept of what the program does."
