  <learning_objectives level="bloom_taxonomy">
    <objective level="remember" measurable="true">Recall the definitions of key terms under UETA: electronic signature, electronic record, and transaction.</objective>
    <objective level="understand" measurable="true">Explain the core provisions of UETA, including legal recognition of electronic records and signatures, consent requirements, attribution, record retention standards, and exceptions (e.g., wills, family law documents, UCC articles on negotiable instruments).</objective>
    <objective level="apply" measurable="true">Apply UETA principles to determine the validity of an electronic signature in a given scenario, such as an email with '/s/' notation.</objective>
    <objective level="analyze" measurable="true">Compare and contrast UETA with the federal E-SIGN Act, identifying key differences in scope and preemption.</objective>
    <objective level="evaluate" measurable="true">Evaluate whether UETA adequately protects against cybersecurity risks like forgery in electronic transactions.</objective>
    <objective level="create" measurable="true">Design a compliance checklist for implementing UETA in a cybersecurity risk management framework, incorporating best practices like audit trails and identity verification.</objective>

    <discussion_prompt>How would you apply this concept in your work environment?</discussion_prompt>
    <peer_teaching>In pairs, one student teaches the other the differences between 'electronic signature' and 'electronic record' using examples (e.g., typed name vs. scanned document) and non-examples (e.g., paper contract); switch roles and provide feedback.</peer_teaching>
    <problem_solving>Analyze this scenario: A phishing email includes a forged electronic signature using a copied image. Is it valid under UETA? Identify required elements (intent, attribution, consent) and recommend mitigation strategies like secure e-signature platforms.</problem_solving>

    <system_prompt>You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance under Security and Risk Management. Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity &gt; Security And Risk Management &gt; Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance &gt; Legal Frameworks and Systems &gt; Contractual Law &gt; Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA).
Generate 25 high-quality flashcards optimized for university pedagogy (Bloom's Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Use this content foundation:
- Definitions: Electronic signature (sound/symbol/process with intent); Electronic record (non-paper info); Transaction (business affairs).
- Adoption: 49 states + DC/PR/USVI; NY similar. Federal: E-SIGN Act.
- Provisions: Legal equivalence; consent; attribution (intent to identify); retention (accurate/accessible); exceptions (wills, family law, UCC negotiables).
- Big picture: Digital transformation enabler, paper reduction, but forgery risks.
- Best practices: Secure platforms, audit trails, ID verification.
- Prior knowledge: Basic contracts (intent, validity).
Incorporate:
1. Learning Objectives: [Insert full learning_objectives JSON here].
2. Active Learning: Tie flashcards to activities (e.g., scenario for problem-solving).
3. Scaffolding: Distribute across 4 layers [Insert full scaffolding_layers JSON here].
4. Schema: Strictly follow [Insert full flashcard_schema JSON here]. Output each flashcard as JSON object in an array.
Ensure completeness (all provisions/exceptions), distractors (plausible, explained), explanations (pedagogical, with feedback). Balance Bloom's/layers. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, e.g., [{'front': '...', 'back': {...}, 'metadata': {...}}, ...].</system_prompt>
