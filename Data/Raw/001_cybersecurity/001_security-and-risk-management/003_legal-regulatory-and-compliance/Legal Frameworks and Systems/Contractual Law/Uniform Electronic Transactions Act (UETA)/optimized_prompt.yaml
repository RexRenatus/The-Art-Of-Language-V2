learning_objectives:
  analyze:
  - objective: Compare and contrast UETA with the federal E-SIGN Act, identifying key differences in scope and preemption.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  remember:
  - objective: 'Recall the definitions of key terms under UETA: electronic signature, electronic record, and transaction.'
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  create:
  - objective: Design a compliance checklist for implementing UETA in a cybersecurity risk management framework, incorporating
      best practices like audit trails and identity verification.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  understand:
  - objective: Explain the core provisions of UETA, including legal recognition of electronic records and signatures, consent
      requirements, attribution, record retention standards, and exceptions (e.g., wills, family law documents, UCC articles
      on negotiable instruments).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Apply UETA principles to determine the validity of an electronic signature in a given scenario, such as an
      email with '/s/' notation.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  evaluate:
  - objective: Evaluate whether UETA adequately protects against cybersecurity risks like forgery in electronic transactions.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student teaches the other the differences between 'electronic signature' and 'electronic record'
    using examples (e.g., typed name vs. scanned document) and non-examples (e.g., paper contract); switch roles and provide
    feedback.
  problem_solving: 'Analyze this scenario: A phishing email includes a forged electronic signature using a copied image. Is
    it valid under UETA? Identify required elements (intent, attribution, consent) and recommend mitigation strategies like
    secure e-signature platforms.'

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards optimized for university pedagogy (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding).
  Use this content foundation:

  - Definitions: Electronic signature (sound/symbol/process with intent); Electronic record (non-paper info); Transaction
  (business affairs).

  - Adoption: 49 states + DC/PR/USVI; NY similar. Federal: E-SIGN Act.

  - Provisions: Legal equivalence; consent; attribution (intent to identify); retention (accurate/accessible); exceptions
  (wills, family law, UCC negotiables).

  - Big picture: Digital transformation enabler, paper reduction, but forgery risks.

  - Best practices: Secure platforms, audit trails, ID verification.

  - Prior knowledge: Basic contracts (intent, validity).


  Incorporate:

  1. Learning Objectives: [Insert full learning_objectives JSON here].

  2. Active Learning: Tie flashcards to activities (e.g., scenario for problem-solving).

  3. Scaffolding: Distribute across 4 layers [Insert full scaffolding_layers JSON here].

  4. Schema: Strictly follow [Insert full flashcard_schema JSON here]. Output each flashcard as JSON object in an array.


  Ensure completeness (all provisions/exceptions), distractors (plausible, explained), explanations (pedagogical, with feedback).
  Balance Bloom''s/layers. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, e.g., [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}, ''metadata'':
  {...}}, ...].'
