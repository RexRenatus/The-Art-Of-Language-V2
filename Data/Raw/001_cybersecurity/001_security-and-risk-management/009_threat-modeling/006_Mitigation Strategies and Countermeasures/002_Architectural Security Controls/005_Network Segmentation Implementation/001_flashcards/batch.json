        "core_logic": "Policy as Code (PaC) is advantageous for microsegmentation because it enables automation and consistency, since policies are treated as code, versioned, and managed within development pipelines. This works by integrating security policy definition directly into the CI/CD process, ensuring that segmentation rules are applied consistently and automatically as microservices are deployed or updated.",
