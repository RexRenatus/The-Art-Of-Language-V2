  discussion_prompt: 'In a fast-paced DevSecOps environment, debate the trade-offs of strict DoD security criteria: Do they
    slow down velocity or prevent costly security debt? Use examples from NIST SP 800-53 controls and real-world breaches
    (e.g., SolarWinds) to support your position.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truth (e.g., NIST control but wrong family); 3) Extreme/overly simplistic (e.g., ''No criteria needed in Agile'').
    Ensure plausible for cybersecurity learners; base on real pitfalls like ignoring shift-left.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Threat Modeling within
  Security and Risk Management. Topic: ''Definition of Done Security Criteria'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk
  Management > Threat Modeling > Threat Modeling in SDLC/DevSecOps > Agile/DevSecOps Integration > Definition of Done Security
  Criteria).


  Incorporate this research context: DoD is a checklist ensuring security tasks are complete, derived from NIST SP 800-53
  Rev. 5 (controls like AC-2, IA-2), SP 800-30 Rev. 1 (risk assessments), OWASP, CIS Controls. Prevents security debt in DevSecOps.
  Prior knowledge: Agile DoD, STRIDE, SDLC.
