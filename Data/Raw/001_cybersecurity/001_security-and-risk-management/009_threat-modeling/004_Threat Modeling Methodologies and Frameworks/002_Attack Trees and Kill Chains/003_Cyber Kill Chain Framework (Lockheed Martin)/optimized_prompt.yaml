active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the effectiveness of the Cyber Kill Chain's linear model against real-world
    non-sequential attacks (e.g., insider threats or supply chain compromises like SolarWinds). Propose modifications and
    justify using evidence from MITRE ATT&CK mappings.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

      framework (e.g., MITRE TTP). Ensure plausible to test understanding, not trickery.'

  Core content from research: Lockheed Martin''s 7-stage model (Hutchins, Cloppert, Amin 2011): 1.Reconnaissance (info gathering),
  2.Weaponization (payload creation), 3.Delivery (phishing/etc.), 4.Exploitation (trigger vuln), 5.Installation (persistence),
  6.Command & Control (C2), 7.Actions on Objectives (exfil/impact). Part of Intelligence-Driven Defense. Defenses per stage.
  Integrates with MITRE ATT&CK, Diamond Model, NIST CSF. Limitations: linear, misses insider/non-sequential attacks. Sources:
