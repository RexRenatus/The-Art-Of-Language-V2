active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, compare ISO/IEC 27001's approach to threat intelligence (Control 5.7) with NIST's
    threat framework. What are the strengths and limitations of each in handling real-world incidents like the SolarWinds
    breach? Provide evidence from the clauses.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    full risk assessment''), (2) Similar but incorrect clauses/controls (e.g., 6.1.3 instead of 6.1.2), (3) Partial truths
    (e.g., ''Annex A only'' omitting Clause 6.1.2), (4) Real-world confusions (e.g., NIST terms). Ensure distractors are plausible
    for mid-level learners.'
