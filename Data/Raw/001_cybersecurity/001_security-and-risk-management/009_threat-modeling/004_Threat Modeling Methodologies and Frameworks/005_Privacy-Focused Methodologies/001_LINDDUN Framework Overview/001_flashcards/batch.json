It functions by correlating identifiers or behavioral patterns across different contexts.",
        "distractor_analysis": "While 'Identifying' might be a consequence, the primary action described is the combination of data. 'Data Disclosure' is too broad, and 'Unawareness' focuses on the user's knowledge rather than the system's action of combining data.",

It functions by violating the principle of data minimization, therefore highlighting potential misuse or breaches.",
