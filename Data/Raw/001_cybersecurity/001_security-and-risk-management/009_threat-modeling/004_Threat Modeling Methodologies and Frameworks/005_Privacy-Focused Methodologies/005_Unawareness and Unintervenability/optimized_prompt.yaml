active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how unawareness of supply chain risks contributed to the SolarWinds breach
    and evaluate whether standard threat modeling like STRIDE alone is sufficient, or if privacy-focused methods like LINDDUN
    are essential. Propose 2-3 interventions and justify using risk assessment basics from the CIA triad.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Threat Modeling (Privacy-Focused
  Methodologies). Topic: ''Unawareness and Unintervenability'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management >
  Threat Modeling > Threat Modeling Methodologies and Frameworks > Privacy-Focused Methodologies > Unawareness and Unintervenability).
  Use this research context: Unawareness = lack of knowledge of assets (shadow IT), threats/TTPs, risks, supply chain, personnel;
  Unintervenability = inability to intervene (poor IR, roles, tools). Examples: SolarWinds (unawareness), Equifax (unintervenability).
  Frameworks: LINDDUN (Unawareness threat), NIST Privacy Framework/SP 800-53, MITRE ATT&CK.


  Incorporate pedagogy: Learning objectives [insert full list above]; Active learning [insert summaries]; Scaffolding layers
  [insert full descriptions]. Prior knowledge: STRIDE, CIA triad, asset ID.


  Big picture: Addressing these enables comprehensive privacy threat modeling against insidious threats.


  Generate 25 flashcards following this exact schema [insert full flashcard_schema above]. Balance across Bloom''s levels
  and layers. Ensure active learning hooks and distractors per protocol. Output as JSON array of objects, each with ''front''
  and ''back'' (nested object). No additional text.'
