  **Context:** Use this completed research summary:

  Portfolio-level threat management: Strategic oversight of cyber risks across organizational portfolios, emphasizing aggregate
  impacts. Core: ERM (business-aligned), CSRR (risk repo), Prioritization (likelihood/impact), Responses (avoid/etc.). Frameworks:
  NIST IR 8286 (ERM integration), NIST IR 8286B (prioritization: 1. Populate CSRR; 2. Assess objectives impact; 3. Prioritize;
  4. Select responses); NIST SP 800-221A (patch mgmt. in portfolios – completes: provides enterprise-wide vulnerability prioritization);
  FAIR/ISO 31000. Sources: [NIST IR 8286](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2020/nist.ir.8286.pdf), [IR 8286B](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/nist.ir.8286b.pdf),
  [SP 800-221A](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-221a.pdf). Examples: SolarWinds (aggregate
  supply chain risks).
