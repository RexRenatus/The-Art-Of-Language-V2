  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether 'Security by Design' in infrastructure operations is more effective
    than retrofitting security post-deployment. Support your position with NIST CSF 2.0 examples (e.g., Govern and Protect
    functions), real-world breaches like SolarWinds, and references to ISO 27001 or CIS Controls. Identify common misconceptions
    that security is solely an IT function rather than a shared responsibility.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
