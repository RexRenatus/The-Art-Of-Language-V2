      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Risk aggregation, as detailed in NISTIR 8286C, involves combining individual cybersecurity risks into a composite view. This process is vital for resource allocation because it allows leadership to understand the cumulative effect of multiple risks on enterprise objectives, enabling more strategic and efficient allocation of resources at an enterprise level.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The correct answer accurately defines risk aggregation as combining risks for a composite view to inform enterprise resource decisions. Distractors describe opposite processes (identification), isolated actions, or unorganized lists, all of which fail to capture the essence of aggregation for resource optimization.",
        "analogy": "Risk aggregation is like understanding that while individual traffic jams are annoying, a city-wide gridlock (aggregated risk) requires a much larger, coordinated response (enterprise-level resource allocation) than fixing one pothole."
