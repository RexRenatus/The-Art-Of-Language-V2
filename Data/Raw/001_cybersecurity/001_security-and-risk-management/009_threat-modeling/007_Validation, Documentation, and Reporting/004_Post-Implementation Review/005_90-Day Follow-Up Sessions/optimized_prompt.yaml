active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the potential risks of skipping 90-day follow-up sessions after implementing
    threat modeling recommendations. How do these sessions prevent 'security drift' in dynamic environments like cloud migrations?
    Support your arguments with NIST CSF 2.0 references and real-world breach examples (e.g., SolarWinds).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    gaps (e.g., incomplete NIST refs); (4) Plausible in edge cases but not best practice. Ensure 1-2 high-quality distractors
    per card.'

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet using university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (prioritize
  progression from REMEMBER to CREATE), active learning hooks, 4-layer scaffolding (Foundation: definitions/priors; Components:
  agenda/participants/tools; Implementation: steps/templates; Integration: NIST CSF/optimizations), and voter consensus (82.9%
  approval).


  **Research Context (Completed):** 90-day sessions validate implementation, assess effectiveness (e.g., NIST CSF 2.0 Govern
  GV.OC-06: cybersecurity performance evaluation), identify gaps, drive improvement. Frameworks: NIST CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/framework),
  SP 800-53 Rev 5 (controls assessment), SP 800-61r2 (incident handling follow-ups, https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf),
  ISO 27001:2022 (9.1 monitoring), CIS Controls v8 (7: Vulnerability Management). Prior knowledge: STRIDE threat modeling,
  DREAD scoring, risk registers.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives from above].

  **Active Learning:** Weave in hooks (e.g., ''Discuss in group: ...'').

  **Scaffolding:** Distribute cards: 40% Layer 1-2, 40% Layer 3, 20% Layer 4.


  **Output 50 cards in JSON array:** Each: {"front": "Question", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "distractors":
  ["opt1", "opt2"]}, "metadata": {...}}. Vary types: 20 cloze, 20 MCQ (4 options), 10 short answer. Follow flashcard_schema
  strictly. Ensure distractors per protocol. Make explanations comprehensive with sources/links to objectives/scaffolding.'
