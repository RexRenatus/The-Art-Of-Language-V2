  Validation).


  Incorporate this research context: Red Team Validation simulates adversarial attacks using TTPs (MITRE ATT&CK) to test defenses
  across people, processes, technology. Key: RTA (CISA), adversary emulation, posture assessment. Standards: DoD Instruction
  8585.01 (DoD Cyber Red Team for APT simulation, requirements for planning/execution/reporting; sources: https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/858501p.pdf).
  Links threat models by testing assumptions/missed threats/mitigations. Contrasts: Pentesting (narrow), Blue (defensive),
  Purple (collaborative).


  Use these EXACT learning objectives, active learning for inspiration (e.g., scenario-based Qs), and 4 scaffolding layers
  (with prior knowledge). Generate flashcards covering all Bloom''s levels and layers.

  Output ONLY a JSON array of 24 flashcards (4 per Bloom level). Each matches this snake_case schema EXACTLY: [INSERT FULL
  flashcard_generation_schema.fields HERE]. No extra text. Balance coverage. Questions active/recall-style. Ensure pedagogical
  depth: explanations reference objectives/layers/research.'
