active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a real-world scenario where a company's firewall was bypassed despite passing initial accuracy assessments,
    debate whether the failure was due to poor implementation, operation, or unmet outcomes. Reference NIST SP 800-53 CA-2
    and provide arguments for each side, considering threat model validation aspects like data flow accuracy.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs based on voter-identified misconceptions (e.g., confuse implementation
    with outcomes; overlook threat model specifics like DFD realism; mix RMF phases). Ensure distractors are realistic (e.g.,
    partial truths from NIST) but incorrect; explain why each is wrong on back.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST-aligned content. Generate
  20-30 high-quality flashcards on ''Accuracy Assessment'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management
  > Threat Modeling > Validation, Documentation, and Reporting > Model Validation > Accuracy Assessment). Focus on threat
  model validation: verifying DFDs, threat lists, control alignment per NIST SP 800-53, 800-53A, 800-37, 800-154.
