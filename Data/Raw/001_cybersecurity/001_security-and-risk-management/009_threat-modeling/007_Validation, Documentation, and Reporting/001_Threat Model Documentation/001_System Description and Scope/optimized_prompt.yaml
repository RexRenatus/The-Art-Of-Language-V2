    compliance (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS) versus resource constraints. What factors should determine inclusion/exclusion?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Distractors must be: 1) Plausible (common misconceptions, e.g., confusing scope with full ERM vs.
    cybersecurity-only), 2) Derived from research (e.g., partial NIST quotes, out-of-context functions like ''Detect focuses
    on recovery''), 3) Varied (one too narrow, one too broad, one unrelated), 4) Avoid ''all/none'' options. Ensure 70% test
    application/analysis.'

  **Research Context (Complete NIST CSF 2.0):** System Description: Detailed IT/OT components (hardware/software/data/personnel).
  Scope: Boundaries for risk management. Organizational Context: Mission/stakeholders/regulations. ERM Integration: Align
  with business risks (COSO/ISO 31000). NIST CSF 2.0 Functions: Govern (GV: context/risk strategy), Identify (ID: ID.AM-Asset
  Mgmt e.g., ID.AM-1: assets inventoried; ID.RA-Risk Assessment e.g., ID.RA-1: vulnerability identification), Protect (PR:
  safeguards), Detect (DE: timely event discovery), Respond (RS: containment/mitigation), Recover (RC: restoration/improvements).
  Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.CSWP.29), OWASP Threat Modeling (https://owasp.org/www-project-threat-modeling/),
  NIST SP 800-30 (Risk Assessments).


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Use provided Learning Objectives (span REMEMBER to CREATE), Active Learning (discussion/peer/problem-solving),
  Scaffolding Layers (1-4). Generate flashcards per Flashcard Schema: MCQ with 4 options, correct bolded, explanation (50-100
  words w/ references, distractor rationale, active learning prompt), Bloom''s tag, difficulty.


  **Output Format:** JSON array of flashcards: [{''question'': ''...'', ''options'': [''A. ...'', ''B. ...'', ''C. ...'',
  ''D. ...''], ''correct_answer'': ''B. ...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''blooms_level'': ''APPLY'', ''scaffolding_layer'':
  2, ''difficulty'': ''Medium''}]. Ensure 20-30 cards: 30% remember/understand, 40% apply/analyze, 30% evaluate/create; balanced
  across layers. Cover voter priorities: completeness (full NIST), pedagogy (action verbs), integration (concept maps via
  explanations).'
