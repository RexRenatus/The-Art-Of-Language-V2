active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of using statistical vs. judgmental sampling in control assessments for a high-risk
    financial institution. When might sampling lead to false assurance, and how does NIST SP 800-53A guide risk-based decisions?
    Provide examples from real-world breaches like Equifax.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''sampling always
    inferior to full testing''); 2) Partial truths (e.g., mix depth/coverage definitions); 3) Related but incorrect terms
    (e.g., ''haphazard'' vs. ''random''); 4) Real-world pitfalls (e.g., over-reliance on judgmental in high-risk scenarios).
    Ensure distractors are realistic from NIST/ISO contexts.'

  Content Overview (Synthesized from NIST SP 800-53A Rev 5, SP 800-37 Rev 2, ISO 19011): Control sampling selects subsets
  of controls for assessment (examine/interview/test) to ensure effectiveness scalably. Key: depth (rigor), coverage (breadth),
  objects (specs/mechanisms/activities/individuals). Techniques: statistical (random/systematic/stratified for confidence),
  non-statistical (judgmental). RMF role: Assess step, risk-based. Sources: NIST SP 800-53A (Assessing Controls), SP 800-37
  Rev 2 (RMF), ISO 19011 (Auditing).


  Learning Objectives (Bloom''s Taxonomy - cover all in flashcards):

  {learning_objectives array above}


  Scaffolding (generate 20-30 flashcards distributed across layers, 5-8 per layer):

  {layer1_foundation}

  {layer2_components}

  {layer3_implementation}

  {layer4_integration}


  Active Learning Integration: Weave in scenarios from {discussion_prompt}, {peer_teaching_activity}, {problem_solving_exercise}
  for higher Bloom''s cards.


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards (10 basic, 10 MCQ, 10 application) optimized for Anki/Quizlet:

  - Span all Bloom''s levels and scaffolding layers.

  - Ensure voter consensus: completeness (all techniques/examples), pedagogy (progressive cognition), big picture (RMF/CISSP).

  - Follow exact {flashcard_schema} for each card.

  - Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'':
  ''...''}]


  Prioritize misconceptions (e.g., sampling = shortcut, ignores risk) and real-world (Equifax, FedRAMP).'
