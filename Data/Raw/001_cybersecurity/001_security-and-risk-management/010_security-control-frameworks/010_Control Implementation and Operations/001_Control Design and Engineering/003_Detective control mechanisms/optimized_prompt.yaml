active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: 'Pair up and assign each student one detective control from NIST CSF DE.CM-1 (e.g., network monitoring or
    anomaly detection). Teach-back to your partner: Define it, give an ISO 27002 mapping (e.g., 8.16), and explain a deployment
    step. Switch roles and quiz each other.'
  problem_solving: 'Analyze this breach log snippet from a simulated SolarWinds-like incident: [Provide sample log: ''Unauthorized
    access at 02:15 from IP 192.168.1.100; no alert triggered'']. Identify missed detections, recommend detective controls
    (e.g., SIEM rules for IDS integration), and outline corrective steps.'

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3-4 plausible distractors for MCQs: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Firewalls are detective''
    vs. preventive); 2) Partial truths (e.g., ''SIEM only for prevention''); 3) Confusions with other frameworks (e.g., NIST
    RESPOND instead of DETECT); 4) Non-examples (corrective controls like backups). Ensure distractors teach by contrasting
    (e.g., preventive timing).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom''s Taxonomy, active
  learning, and scaffolding. Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for the topic: ''Detective control mechanisms''
  (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Control Frameworks > Control Implementation and Operations
  > Control Design and Engineering > Detective control mechanisms).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM ''learning_objectives'']

  - Scaffolding layers: [PASTE FULL SCAFFOLDING DETAILS]

  - Active learning: Inspire questions from [discussion, peer_teaching, problem_solving] (e.g., scenario-based from problem-solving).

  - Prior knowledge: Link to preventive controls, defense-in-depth.

  - Completeness: Include ISO 27002 (8.15 Logging, 8.16 Monitoring), NIST CSF DETECT (DE.CM, DE.AE), CIS Controls, COBIT;
  examples (SIEM, IDS, file integrity monitoring); real-world (SolarWinds logs); misconceptions.


  Follow flashcard schema exactly: Output ONLY a JSON array of 30-40 unique flashcards. Each: {"front": "...", "back": "..."
  (or options/correct for MCQ), "type": "qa|cloze|mcq", "explanation": "...", "bloom_level": "REMEMBER|UNDERSTAND|APPLY|ANALYZE|EVALUATE|CREATE",
  "scaffolding_layer": "1|2|3|4"}.

  Use distractor protocol strictly. Ensure variety, no repetition, progressive difficulty. Explanations reference objectives/layers/standards.'
