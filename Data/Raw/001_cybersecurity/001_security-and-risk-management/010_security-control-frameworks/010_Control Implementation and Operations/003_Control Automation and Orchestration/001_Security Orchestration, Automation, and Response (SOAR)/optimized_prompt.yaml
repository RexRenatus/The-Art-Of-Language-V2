active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one learner explains SOAR components (orchestration vs. automation vs. response) while the other
    sketches a custom playbook diagram; switch roles and provide teach-back feedback.
  problem_solving: Design a SOAR workflow for a phishing incident integrating at least three tools (e.g., SIEM for alert ingestion,
    email gateway for quarantine, EDR for endpoint isolation). Outline steps, decision points, and metrics to measure success.

    Provide brief explanation (50 words max each) linking to why wrong and correct concept.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Use the following to create 25 high-quality
