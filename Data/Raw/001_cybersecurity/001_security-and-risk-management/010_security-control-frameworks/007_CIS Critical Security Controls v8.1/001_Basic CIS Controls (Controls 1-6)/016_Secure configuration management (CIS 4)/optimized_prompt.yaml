active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the real-world impacts of poor configuration management (e.g., vulnerabilities
    like EternalBlue exploiting default SMB settings). How does CIS Control 4 address these, and what challenges arise when
    integrating it with CIS Controls 1-3? Support with examples from recent breaches.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
