active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a small group, debate the trade-offs of application whitelisting versus blacklisting in a resource-constrained
    small business environment. Consider factors like false positives, management overhead, and malware evasion techniques.
    Cite evidence from CIS Controls and NIST frameworks to support your position.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., ''Whitelisting blocks known bad software only'' – confuses with blacklisting)'
    - 'Distractor 2: Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Permits all signed software'' – ignores organizational approval)'
    - 'Distractor 3: Outdated/irrelevant concept (e.g., ''Relies on antivirus signatures'' – shifts to blacklist paradigm)'
    - 'Base on voter-noted issues: whitelist/blacklist confusion, implementation challenges, framework specifics'
    quantity: 3 per MCQ, plausible to advanced learners
