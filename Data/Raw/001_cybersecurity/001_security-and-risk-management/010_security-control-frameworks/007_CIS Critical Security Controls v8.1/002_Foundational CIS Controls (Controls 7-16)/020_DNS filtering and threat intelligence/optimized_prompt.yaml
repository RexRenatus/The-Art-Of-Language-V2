active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''DNS filtering alone is sufficient for malware prevention
    in modern networks.'' Use evidence from threat intelligence reports and CIS Controls to support your position, considering
    bypass techniques like DNS over HTTPS (DoH).'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
