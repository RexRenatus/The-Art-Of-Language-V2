    2. Common misconception (e.g., ''Logs don''t need time sync if local'').

    3. Extreme/opposite (e.g., ''Delete logs immediately after review''). Base on real pitfalls like underestimating volume
    or ignoring privacy.'

  **Core Content Integration:**

  - Research: Audit logs record events (what/when/where/who); log management = generate/transmit/store/access/dispose. Key
  for threat detection/incident response. CIS Control 8: 12 safeguards - 8.1 Establish/Maintain Audit Log Management Process;
  8.2 Collect Audit Logs; 8.3 Ensure Adequate Storage Capacity; 8.4 Detailed Audit Logging; 8.5 Centralize Logs; 8.6 Network
  Device Logs; 8.7 Network Traffic Logs; 8.8 Time Synchronization (NTP); 8.9 Review for Suspicious Activity; 8.10 Retain Logs;
  8.11 Protect Logs from Unauthorized Access; 8.12 Baseline and Alert on Log Anomalies. NIST SP 800-92: Guidance on log generation,
  analysis, disposal.

  - Prior Knowledge: Links to CIS 1-7 (e.g., inventory for sources).

  - Related: CIS 13 (threat detection), CIS 19 (incident response), SIEM tools.


  **Pedagogy:**

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list from above]

  - Scaffolding: [insert full 4 layers from above]

  - Active Learning Inspiration: Use discussion (privacy vs. security), peer teaching (safeguards), problem-solving (phishing
  logs) to inspire scenario cards.


  **Flashcard Generation:** Follow exact schema [insert full flashcard_schema from above]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 60
  objects, each matching the per-card format. Ensure variety, no repetition, high fidelity to CIS v8.1, measurable progression
  through Bloom''s.'
