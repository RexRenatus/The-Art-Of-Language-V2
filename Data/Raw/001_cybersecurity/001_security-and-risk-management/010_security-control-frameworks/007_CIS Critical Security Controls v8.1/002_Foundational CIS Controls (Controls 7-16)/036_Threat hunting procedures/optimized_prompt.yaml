active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In groups, debate the value of focusing on high-level Pyramid of Pain indicators (e.g., TTPs) versus
    low-level ones (e.g., IoCs) in threat hunting. Use examples from real-world APT campaigns and CIS Controls 7-16 to support
    arguments on proactive defense effectiveness.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 40 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Threat Hunting Procedures'' in Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management
  > Security Control Frameworks > CIS Critical Security Controls v8.1 > Foundational CIS Controls (Controls 7-16) > Threat
  hunting procedures.


  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives**: [Paste the full learning_objectives array here].

  - **Active Learning**: Embed hints in explanations (e.g., ''Apply in problem-solving exercise'').

  - **Scaffolding**: Distribute cards evenly: 10 per layer. Use provided scaffolding descriptions as content source.

  - **Research Context** (complete summary): Threat hunting is proactive search for hidden threats using human expertise.
  Key concepts: IoCs (artifacts), IoAs (behaviors), TTPs. Pyramid of Pain: Base (IPs/hashes) to top (TTPs). Cyber Kill Chain:
  Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, C2, Actions. Methodologies: Structured (hypothesis),
  Unstructured (anomaly), Entity Timeline. Procedures: 1) Hypothesis (intel-driven), 2) Data collection (CIS logs/monitoring),
  3) Analysis (tools like SIEM/EDR), 4) Investigation, 5) Documentation, 6) Response. Sources: chaossearch.io, cynet.com,
  SANS, MITRE ATT&CK, CIS v8.1 Controls 7-16.


  **Output exactly a JSON array of flashcard objects matching the precise schema** [Paste full flashcard_schema here]. No
  extra text. Ensure variety, progressive difficulty (Layer 1 easy, Layer 4 complex), and pedagogical alignment. Cards must
  support Bloom''s progression and tie to CIS Controls.'
