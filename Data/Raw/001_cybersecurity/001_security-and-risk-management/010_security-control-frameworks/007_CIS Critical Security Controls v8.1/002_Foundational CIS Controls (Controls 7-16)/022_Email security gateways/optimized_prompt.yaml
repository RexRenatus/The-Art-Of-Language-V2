active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent do email security gateways (ESGs) mitigate risks like phishing, spoofing, BEC, and data
    exfiltration compared to end-user training alone? Debate the pros, cons, and evidence from real-world case studies (e.g.,
    notable breaches like the 2020 Twitter BEC incident or SolarWinds phishing campaigns), considering integration with CIS
    Controls 7-16.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
