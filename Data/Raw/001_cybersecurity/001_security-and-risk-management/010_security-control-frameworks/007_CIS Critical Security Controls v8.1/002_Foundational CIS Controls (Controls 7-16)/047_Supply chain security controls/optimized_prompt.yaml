active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the organizational resilience provided by supply chain security controls
    against nation-state attacks like SolarWinds. How do foundational CIS Controls 7-16 extend internal security (from Controls
    1-6) to the supply chain ecosystem? Support arguments with mappings to NIST SP 800-161 and ISO 28000.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Plausible but incorrect: Based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse ISO 28000 with physical-only security vs. integrated
      cyber-physical).'
    - 'From adjacent concepts: Mix elements from other frameworks (e.g., NIST CSF ID.RA as distractor for GV.SC).'
    - 'Partial truths: Overly narrow or outdated info (e.g., ''CIS Control 7 only for internal vulns'' vs. supply chain extension).'
    - 'Real-world pitfalls: Reflect vendor risks like SolarWinds (e.g., distractor: ''Ignore service providers if no direct
      access'').'
    - 'Balance: 1 superficial, 1 conceptual error, 1 overgeneralization.'
