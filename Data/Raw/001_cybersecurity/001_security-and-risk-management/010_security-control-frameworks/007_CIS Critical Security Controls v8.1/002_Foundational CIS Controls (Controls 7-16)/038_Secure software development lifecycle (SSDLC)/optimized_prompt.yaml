  Incorporate this synthesized content:

  - Foundation: SDLC phases (planning/design/implementation/verification/release/response), SSDLC extension, key terms (vulnerability,
  risk mitigation). Big picture: Builds secure-by-design software per CIS v8.1 Controls 7-16 (e.g., Control 16: App Software
  Security).

  - Components: NIST SSDF (SP 800-218): PO (Prepare Org: security reqs), PR (Protect: threat modeling), PS (Produce Secure:
  coding/testing), RV (Review: verification). Concept map: SSDLC → SDLC phases → SSDF → CIS links.

  - Implementation: Phase practices – Planning (PO: reqs), Design (PR: modeling), Impl (PS: secure code), Verif (SAST/DAST),
  Release (SBOMs), Response (monitoring).

  - Integration: CIS 7-16 links, supply chain, DevSecOps. Sources: NIST SP 800-218, CISA.
