  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Human error causes 74-95% of breaches (per Verizon DBIR);
    discuss how security awareness programs fit into the Security and Risk Management domain to reduce this, citing NIST SP
    800-50 phases and CIS Control 14 evidence.'' Encourage critical thinking on cultural barriers.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Plausible but incomplete (e.g., wrong NIST phase), 3) Extreme/edge case (e.g., overemphasis on tech vs human). Ensure
    distractors are realistic, derived from research context (e.g., mix up CIS Control 13 with 14, NIST 800-50 vs 800-16).
