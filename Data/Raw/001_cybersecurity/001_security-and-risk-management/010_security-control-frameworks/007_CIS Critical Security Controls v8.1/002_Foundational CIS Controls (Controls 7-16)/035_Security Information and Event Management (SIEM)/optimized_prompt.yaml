active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the role of SIEM in a modern SOC, debating pros/cons of SIEM vs. emerging XDR/SOAR in the context
    of CIS Controls 7-16 (e.g., continuous monitoring). Address misconceptions like 'SIEM detects all threats perfectly' and
    discuss false positives, scalability challenges, and integration needs for effective incident response.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, take turns explaining core SIEM concepts (e.g., event correlation vs. log management) using analogies
    (correlation as a detective linking clues). Partner quizzes with examples/non-examples (e.g., isolated login failure vs.
    correlated brute-force attack). Switch roles to cover UEBA/SOAR integration.
  problem_solving: Provide anonymized log samples (firewall denies, IDS alerts, auth failures). In groups, correlate events
    to detect threats (e.g., data exfiltration or brute-force). Design SIEM rules for CIS Control 13 (vulnerability management)
    application, then simulate tuning to reduce false positives in a SOC scenario.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in SIEM under CIS Critical
  Security Controls v8.1 (Foundational Controls 7-16). Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security

  Incorporate this research context: [Insert full research summary here, including core concepts: SIEM (SIM+SEM), log management,
  event correlation, threat detection, incident response, SOC, UEBA. Completed NIST CSF: Detect (monitor/analyze events),
  Respond (investigate/prioritize), Recover (lessons learned), Govern (risk management oversight). CIS mappings: Control 6
  (logs), 7 (monitoring), 13 (vuln mgmt).]

  Generate flashcards per schema: [paste schema above]. Balance by layers/Bloom''s. Ensure web-grounded (e.g., real-time visibility,
  false positives). Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
