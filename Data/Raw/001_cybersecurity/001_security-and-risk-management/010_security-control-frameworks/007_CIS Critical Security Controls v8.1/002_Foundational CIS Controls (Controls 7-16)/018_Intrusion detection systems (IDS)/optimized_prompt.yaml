active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of deploying signature-based vs. anomaly-based IDS in a
    high-traffic enterprise network. Consider factors like false positive rates, evasion risks, and resource demands. Link
    to CIA triad impacts and CIS Control 13 (Network Monitoring).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1 common misconception (e.g., ''IPS only detects''), 1 related
    but incorrect term (e.g., ''Firewall'' vs. ''NIDS''), 1 edge case/extreme (e.g., ''100% accurate detection''). Ensure
    distractors test subtle distinctions (e.g., signature vs. anomaly pros). Base on research context and voter suggestions.'

  Use this optimized pedagogy:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the ''learning_objectives'' array above verbatim].

  - Active Learning: Inspire cards that scaffold toward [discussion_prompt], [peer_teaching_activity], [problem_solving_exercise].

  - Scaffolding: Generate cards across 4 layers: [Insert ''scaffolding_layers'' array verbatim].


  Content Sources: Integrate research summary (IDS monitors for malicious actions; types: NIDS/HIDS; IPS/IDPS/SIEM; methods:
  Signature (patterns), Anomaly (baselines), SPA (protocol profiles/deviations)). Voter Consensus (100%): Complete SPA, add
  pros/cons/evasion/integration with CIS 7-16/tools (Snort/Suricata/OSSEC)/best practices/false positives/SIEM.


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards following this schema exactly: [Insert ''flashcard_schema'' verbatim].


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''type'': ''Basic|MCQ|Cloze'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...''}]. Ensure
  spaced repetition: varied phrasing, active recall. No duplicates; cover all objectives/layers.'
