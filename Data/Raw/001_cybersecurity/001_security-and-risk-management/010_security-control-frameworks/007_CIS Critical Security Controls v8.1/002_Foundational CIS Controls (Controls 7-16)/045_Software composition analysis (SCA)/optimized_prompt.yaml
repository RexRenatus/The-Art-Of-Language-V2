active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given that open-source software makes up 70-90% of modern codebases, debate the risks (e.g., unpatched
    vulnerabilities, supply chain attacks) and benefits (e.g., innovation, cost savings) of relying heavily on OSS. How does
    SCA address these in a DevSecOps pipeline? Support with real-world examples like Log4j.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate this comprehensive content:

  [Foundation Layer]: SCA automates identification/management of OSS/third-party components (70-90% of codebases). Key terms:
  OSS, dependencies (direct/transitive), vulnerabilities (NVD), license compliance, SBOM (machine-readable inventory). Prior
  knowledge: OSS basics, CIS Control 7, supply chain risks. Big Picture: Secure SDLC, NIST EO 14028 SBOM mandate.

  [Components Layer]: Tools (OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk), DBs (NVD), SBOM formats (SPDX/CycloneDX). Links: CIS 2/10, OWASP.

  [Implementation Layer]: Workflow: Scan > Analyze (CVSS) > Remediate (update/pin) > SBOM export.

  [Integration Layer]: DevSecOps CI/CD, ISO/IEC 27001 A.15 (supplier risks), policy as code. Sources: CIS v8.1, NIST SP 800-161,
  NVD, EO 14028.
