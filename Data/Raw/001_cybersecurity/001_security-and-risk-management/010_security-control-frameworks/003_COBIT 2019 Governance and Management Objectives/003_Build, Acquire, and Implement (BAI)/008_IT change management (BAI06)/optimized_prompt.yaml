  discussion_prompt: 'Debate: Should emergency changes bypass full change management processes (e.g., BAI06 full lifecycle)
    during cybersecurity crises? Use real-world examples like the Log4Shell vulnerability response (CVE-2021-44228) and reference
    COBIT BAI06.03 authorization and NIST CM-3(2) for emergency changes. Argue pros/cons for risk vs. agility.'

  - **Learning Objectives**: [Paste the full learning_objectives array here].

  - **Active Learning**: [Paste the full active_learning object here].

  - **Scaffolding**: [Paste the full scaffolding array here].

  - **Prior Knowledge**: ITIL Change Management, PMBOK Change Control, basic risk assessment.

  - **Research Context**: IT Change Management (BAI06) ensures controlled changes to minimize security risks. COBIT BAI06
  Purpose: Manage changes timely/controlled for reliable/secure IT. Practices: BAI06.01 (Change Request), BAI06.02 (Assess/Prioritize),
  BAI06.03 (Authorize), BAI06.04 (Coordinate/Deploy), BAI06.05 (Review). NIST SP 800-53 CM: CM-1 Policy, CM-2 Baseline, CM-3
