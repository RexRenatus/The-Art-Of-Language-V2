active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains TPRM (focus on vendor risk assessment) while the other explains C-SCRM (focus
    on supply chain cybersecurity); switch roles after 5 minutes and conduct a teach-back quiz with 3 custom questions each
    to verify understanding.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario for procuring a cloud IaaS service, draft 5 security-specific clauses for the service
    agreement (e.g., data encryption, audit rights, breach notification). Peer-review in small groups, applying APO09 monitoring
    practices to identify improvements.

  **Content Foundation (Complete Research Context)**:

  APO09 ensures internal/external services align with enterprise security via TPRM (identify/assess/mitigate vendor risks),
  C-SCRM (supply chain cybersecurity), SLAs (metrics like 99.9% uptime, <24hr breach notification). COBIT practices: APO09.01
  Establish agreements; APO09.02 Manage relationships; metrics (% compliant SLAs). NIST SP 800-37 RMF: Integrate supplier
  risks in Prepare/Execute steps. NIST CSF GV.SC-5: Manage supply chain risks. Big picture: APO09 enables governance in COBIT
  APO for risk-optimized external dependencies. Sources: COBIT 2019, NIST CSF 2.0, NIST SP 800-37 Rev2, ISO 27001:2022 A.5.19/8.1.
