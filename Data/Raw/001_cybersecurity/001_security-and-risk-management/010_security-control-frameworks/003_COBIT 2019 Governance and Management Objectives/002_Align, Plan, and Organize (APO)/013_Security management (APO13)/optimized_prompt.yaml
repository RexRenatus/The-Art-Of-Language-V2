active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the strengths and weaknesses of NIST CSF 2.0 versus ISO 27001 for implementing security management
    (COBIT APO13) in a mid-sized enterprise. Provide real-world examples (e.g., SolarWinds hack) where one framework might
    outperform the other in aligning security with business objectives.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains a key component of an ISMS under ISO 27001 (e.g., risk assessment via PDCA
    cycle), while the partner teaches COBIT APO13 governance integration; switch roles and complete a teach-back quiz with
    3 questions on the other's topic.
  problem_solving: 'Analyze the SolarWinds supply chain breach case study: Groups identify failures in security governance,
    then design a COBIT APO13-aligned security management plan, including risk mitigation steps, RACI assignments, and metrics
    for monitoring (e.g., reduction in security incidents).'

    strategy with APO12 risk); (2) Plausible similar term (e.g., NIST ''Detect'' as distractor for APO13.04 monitoring); (3)
    Partial truth/exaggeration (e.g., ''PDCA only for ISO 27002'' vs. 27001). Ensure distractors are web-grounded from frameworks.'
