  discussion_prompt: In what ways does Enterprise Architecture Management (APO03) bridge the gap between business strategy
    and cybersecurity risk management? Compare its role in COBIT 2019 with NIST CSF 2.0 Govern function, using a real-world
    example like a financial institution facing ransomware threats. What challenges arise in implementation, and how can tools
    like ArchiMate address them?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  ## Enterprise Architecture Management (EAM) in Cybersecurity

  [Core Concepts: EA blueprint, EAM discipline, Cybersecurity protection, Risk/ERM management.]

  [COBIT 2019 APO03: Purpose - Establish/maintain EA models/overlays for business-IT alignment incl. security. Key Practices:
  APO03.01 Define EA approach; APO03.02 Reference model; APO03.03 Roadmap. KPIs: EA compliance %, incidents. Links to cyber:
  Security architecture integration.]

  [NIST CSF 2.0: Govern (GV) function (e.g., GV.OC Organizational Context, GV.RM Risk Strategy). Profiles: Current (as-is),
  Target (to-be). Tiers: 1 Partial (ad-hoc), 2 Risk Informed (risk-aware processes), 3 Repeatable (consistent), 4 Adaptive
  (innovative).]

  Flashcard Generation Rules:

  - Follow exact schema: 1/3 Basic/Cloze, 2/3 MCQ with distractors per protocol.

  - Cover all Bloom''s levels/objectives, scaffolding layers proportionally (Layer1:25%, L2:25%, L3:25%, L4:25%).

  - Ensure active learning ties (e.g., ''Apply to case study'').

  - Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''mcq'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''blooms_level'': ''APPLY'', ''layer'':
  ''3'', ''explanation'': ''...''}].
