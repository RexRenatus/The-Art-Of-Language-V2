  Incorporate these learning objectives [INSERT learning_objectives array]. Use active learning for context: [INSERT active_learning_components].
  Structure content via scaffolding layers: [INSERT scaffolding_layers].


  Research context: COBIT APO04 purpose - systematically manage innovation for business value. Practices: APO04.01 Foster
  culture, APO04.02 Gather/evaluate opportunities, APO04.03 Manage portfolio, APO04.04 Invest. Integrates with NIST CSF 2.0
  (Govern: risk strategy; Identify: threats; etc.) for cybersecurity innovation (e.g., threat detection tools). Sources: COBIT
  2019 Framework (ISACA), NIST CSF 2.0 (nist.gov).


  Generate flashcards per schema: [INSERT flashcard_generation_schema]. Output as JSON array of objects: [{''type'': ''Basic
  Q/A'' or ''MCQ'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''blooms_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...''}]. Ensure
  high pedagogical quality: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, distractors plausible. Cover all Bloom''s levels and
  layers progressively.'
