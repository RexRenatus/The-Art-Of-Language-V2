  discussion_prompt: In a resource-constrained environment, debate whether to prioritize high-impact, rare events (e.g., nation-state
    attacks like SolarWinds) or frequent low-impact threats (e.g., phishing). Use COBIT EDM03 practices to justify resource
    allocation and consider the organization's risk appetite.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, explain one of the four risk response strategies (mitigate, transfer, avoid, accept) using a cybersecurity
    example (e.g., mitigate via multi-factor authentication). Switch pairs and teach-back, then group-discuss integration
    into EDM03.
  problem_solving: Given a company with a $1M cybersecurity budget and 5 risks (e.g., ransomware, insider threat, supply chain
    vulnerability, DDoS, unpatched software), create a risk prioritization matrix based on likelihood/impact. Optimize responses
    per EDM03.03 (prioritize risks) and present trade-offs.
