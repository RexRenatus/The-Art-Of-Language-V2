active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the merits of using COBIT DSS02.02 criteria versus NIST SP 800-61 phases for prioritizing service
    requests and incidents in a cybersecurity breach scenario (e.g., ransomware attack). What trade-offs exist in terms of
    speed vs. thoroughness, and how does this impact COBIT's alignment with EDM/APO governance?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    with service requests, swapping NIST phases); (2) Partial truths (e.g., correct for ITIL but wrong for COBIT); (3) Edge
    cases (e.g., low-impact incidents misprioritized); (4) Voter-noted gaps (e.g., incomplete NIST CSF). Ensure distractors
    teach by contrast.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, aligned with university pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 30 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Service Requests
  and Incident Management (DSS02)'' in the hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Control Frameworks
  > COBIT 2019 Governance and Management Objectives > Deliver, Service, and Support (DSS) > Service requests and incident
  management (DSS02).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the full array from ''learning_objectives''].

  - Active Learning: [summarize briefly: discussion on COBIT vs NIST trade-offs, peer teaching on differences/classification,
  group problem-solving on ticketing logs].

  - Scaffolding: [paste full scaffolding object].

  - Research Context: Incidents restore service post-interruption; Service requests are routine (e.g., access). DSS02.02:
  Record/classify/prioritize. NIST SP 800-61: Preparation/Detection/Containment/Recovery/Post-Incident. NIST CSF Respond.
  Big picture: Supports COBIT governance/business continuity.


  Distribute flashcards: 30% Layer 1/REMEMBER-UNDERSTAND, 30% Layer 2-3/APPLY-ANALYZE, 40% Layer 4/EVALUATE-CREATE. 70% MCQ,
  20% Cloze, 10% Short-Answer. Ensure coverage of comparisons (COBIT vs NIST/ITIL), prioritization matrices, real scenarios.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: Output ONLY a JSON array of 30 flashcards, no extra text. Each card must have ''front'',
  ''back'' (with subkeys), ''metadata''. Use distractor protocol rigorously. Explanations must reference objectives/layers/activities
  for spaced repetition and active recall.'
