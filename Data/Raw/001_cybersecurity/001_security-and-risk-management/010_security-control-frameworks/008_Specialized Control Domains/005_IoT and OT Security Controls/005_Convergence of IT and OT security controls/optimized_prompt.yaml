active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of IT/OT convergence, debate whether prioritizing IT's CIA triad over OT's safety and
    availability could lead to catastrophic failures. Use examples from NIST SP 800-82r3 to support your position. (Encourages
    critical thinking and addresses misconceptions that IT controls directly apply to OT.)
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
