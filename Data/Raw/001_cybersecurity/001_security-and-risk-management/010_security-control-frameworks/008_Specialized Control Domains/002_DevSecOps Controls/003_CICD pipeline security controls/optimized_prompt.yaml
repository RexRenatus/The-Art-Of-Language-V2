  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of ''shifting security left'' in CI/CD pipelines: How does
    integrating security early (e.g., SAST in build stage) impact development velocity versus risk reduction? Use OWASP risks
    and real-world examples (e.g., SolarWinds SSC attack) to support arguments.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
