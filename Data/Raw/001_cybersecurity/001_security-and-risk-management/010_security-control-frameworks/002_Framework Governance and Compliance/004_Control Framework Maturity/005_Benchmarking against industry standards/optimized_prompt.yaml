active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of selecting NIST CSF 2.0 versus ISO/IEC 27001 for benchmarking
    in a small vs. large organization. Consider factors like cost, flexibility, compliance requirements, and scalability.
    Support arguments with real-world examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
