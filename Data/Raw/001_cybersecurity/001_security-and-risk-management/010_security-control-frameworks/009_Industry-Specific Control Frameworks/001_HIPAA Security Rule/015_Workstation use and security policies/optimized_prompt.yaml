active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, share real-world examples of workstation security violations in healthcare (e.g.,
    shared logins leading to ePHI breaches). Debate how HIPAA §164.310(c)/(d) and NIST AC-6/CM-6 could prevent them, citing
    specific policy elements.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    admin rights ever''), 2) Related but incorrect term (e.g., ''least functionality'' confused with ''zero trust''), 3) Partial
    truth/overgeneralization (e.g., HIPAA section off-by-one like §164.308 instead of §164.310). Ensure distractors test subtle
    understanding without being obvious.'

  **Completed Research Context:**

  Core Concepts: Workstation (individual professional computer, incl. laptops); Security Policy (rules for asset protection);
  AUP (acceptable IT use); Least Privilege (min permissions needed); Least Functionality (essential capabilities only, reduce
  attack surface); Configuration Management (baselines, change control); Incident Response; PII/ePHI (electronic Protected
  Health Information).

  HIPAA Security Rule: §164.310(c) Workstation Use (policies for authorized ePHI functions); §164.310(d) Workstation Security
  (physical safeguards); §164.308(a)(8) (workstation evaluation in risk management).

  NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 Controls: AC-6 (Least Privilege); CM-2/CM-6/CM-7 (Configuration Baseline/Least Functionality/Settings);
  AT-2/AT-3/AT-4 (Security Awareness/Role-Based Training/Records); MP-4 (Media Storage); SC-7 (Boundary Protection). Integrate
  with NIST CSF (Protect function).

  Sources: HIPAA Security Rule (45 CFR §164.300-316); NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5; NIST CSF 2.0; CIS Controls v8 (Control 5: Account
  Management).

  Real-world: Clinic shared logins breach ePHI (prevent via RBAC/AUP).


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the exact array from ''learning_objectives'' above].

  - Scaffolding: [Insert the exact array from ''scaffolding'' above] – Distribute cards evenly.

  - Active Learning Tie-in: Cards should prompt recall for discussions (e.g., breach scenarios), explanations for peer teaching,
  applications for problem-solving.

  - Bloom''s Coverage: Balance across levels as in objectives.


  **Flashcard Generation Rules:**

  Follow the exact schema: [Insert the full ''flashcard_schema'' object above].

  - Mix types for engagement.

  - Distractors per protocol.

  - Ensure HIPAA/NIST accuracy; use healthcare examples.

  - Voter Consensus (87.1%): Emphasize measurable objectives, 4 layers, complete NIST/HIPAA coverage.
