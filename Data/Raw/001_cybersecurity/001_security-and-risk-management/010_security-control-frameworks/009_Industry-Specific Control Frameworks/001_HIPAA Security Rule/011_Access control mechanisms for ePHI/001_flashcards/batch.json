      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Periodic evaluation is essential because security environments and threats constantly change, requiring ongoing assessment to ensure policies remain effective and compliant. It works by establishing a process for reviewing technical and nontechnical security measures against HIPAA requirements and environmental shifts, fulfilling the HIPAA standard (§ 164.308(a)(8)).",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors misattribute the purpose of evaluation to initial risk assessment, control implementation, or workforce training, failing to recognize its role in ongoing assessment and adaptation of existing security measures.",
        "analogy": "It's like a regular car inspection; it checks if the current safety features are still working correctly and if any new safety standards need to be met."
