active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the optimal frequency of penetration testing (annual vs. quarterly) for
    a payment card processing organization under PCI DSS Req 11. Consider trade-offs between cost, risk reduction, and compliance—support
    your position with references to NIST SP 800-115 and real-world breach examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Ensure completeness: Cover PCI DSS Req 11 (quarterly ASV/external scans, internal scans, annual pen tests, post-change testing,
  IDS/IPS); NIST SP 800-53/53A/115; RMF Assess/Monitor. Use voter priorities: Progress Bloom''s, 4-layer scaffold, accuracy
  to PCI.
