active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare the risk-based approaches of NIST CSF 2.0 and ISO/IEC 27001 for audit assurance in cloud environments.
    Which framework better supports compliance for a multi-cloud deployment, and why? Use examples from recent breaches like
    the Capital One incident to support your arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs: Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse AAC-01 Planning
    with AAC-02 Logging; mix up CSA CCM with NIST CSF controls; use similar-sounding controls like AUD-01 vs. AAC-02). Ensure
    distractors are realistic from related frameworks (CIS, NIST) but incorrect for the question.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in the topic ''Audit Assurance
  and Compliance (AAC)'' under the hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Control Frameworks >
  Industry-Specific Control Frameworks > Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Cloud Controls Matrix > Audit Assurance and Compliance
  (AAC).


  Generate 50 high-quality Anki-style flashcards optimized for spaced repetition, covering the full topic with emphasis on
  CSA CCM AAC controls (e.g., AAC-01 Audit Planning, AAC-02 Audit Logging, AUD-01 Audit Logging, COM-01 Compliance Monitoring,
  AAC-03 Audit Management).

  Ensure completeness: Cover truncated areas like CIS Controls integration, full sources (NIST.gov, CSA CCM docs, ZeroNetworks.com).
  Cards promote active recall: 40% cloze/short answer, 60% MCQ with distractors. Vary difficulty per Bloom''s. Output only
  the JSON array.'
