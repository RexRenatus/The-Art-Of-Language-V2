active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a cloud environment, how does Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) enhance the Detection & Analysis phase
    of NIST SP 800-61r3 compared to traditional on-premises incident response? Discuss potential challenges and mitigations,
    referencing CSA CCM SEF-04 (Incident Monitoring).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  \ > Security incident management (SEF). SEF = Security Incident Management domain in CSA CCM.\n\nIncorporate these pedagogical\
  \ elements:\n- Learning Objectives: [Insert full learning_objectives array here]\n- Active Learning: Use for scenario-based\
