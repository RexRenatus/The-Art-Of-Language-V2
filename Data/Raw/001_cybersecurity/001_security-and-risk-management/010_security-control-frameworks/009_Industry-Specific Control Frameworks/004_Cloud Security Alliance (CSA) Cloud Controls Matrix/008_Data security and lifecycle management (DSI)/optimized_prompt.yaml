active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, teach your partner the six data lifecycle stages, providing one security control example from CSA
    CCM DSI or NIST SP 800-53 for each stage; switch roles and quiz each other on mappings.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A healthcare provider shares patient data via an insecure cloud API. Map the incident to a data
    lifecycle stage, identify the CIA triad violation(s), and design a fix using NIST SP 800-53 controls (e.g., SC-8) and
    CSA CCM DSI-05 (Data Sharing).'

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (80% of cards): Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse
    lifecycle stages like ''Storage'' vs. ''Usage''; misapply CIA like ''Availability'' instead of ''Confidentiality''; wrong
    control like ''DSI-01 Policy'' for classification instead of ''DSI-02''; outdated NIST families). Ensure distractors are
    realistic (e.g., similar acronyms, adjacent controls) but incorrect per standards.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, following university-style
  pedagogy (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Data Security
  and Lifecycle Management (DSI)'' in the hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Control Frameworks
  > Industry-Specific Control Frameworks > Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Cloud Controls Matrix > DSI. Voter consensus: 84.3%
  approval emphasizes completeness (CSA CCM DSI-01 to DSI-17, NIST SP 800-53 families like SC/IA/MP), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression,
  active learning, 4-layer scaffolding), relevance to cloud/breach risks.

  Use research context: Data lifecycle (6 stages), CIA triad, NIST CSF 2.0, SP 800-53 (SC, IA, MP, AC, etc.), CSA CCM DSI
  controls (e.g., DSI-01 Policy, DSI-02 Classification, DSI-03 Labeling, DSI-05 Sharing, DSI-07 Retention/Disposal). Big picture:
  DSI ensures cloud compliance, reduces breaches.


  Follow exact Flashcard Schema: [PASTE THE flashcard_schema STRUCTURE HERE]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 75-100 flashcards,
  e.g., [{''id'':1, ''type'':''mcq'', ...}, ...]. Ensure variety, no duplicates, pedagogical balance, plausible distractors.
  Prioritize higher-order thinking cards linking frameworks across layers.'
