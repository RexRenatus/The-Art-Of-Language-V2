    cloud setups versus on-premises environments. Use examples from CSA CCM and NIST CSF to support arguments on risk ownership
    and accountability.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

    - 'Distractor 2: Common misconception (e.g., confuse GRM-01 Policy with operational controls).'
    - 'Distractor 3: Too narrow or unrelated (e.g., NIST-specific without CSA mapping).'
    - 'Distractor 4 (optional): Reverse/extreme (e.g., ''No policy needed in cloud'').'
    - Ensure distractors are realistic, derived from related concepts (e.g., NIST vs. CSA differences)

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in CSA Cloud Controls Matrix
  (CCM) GRM domain. Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Control Frameworks > Industry-Specific
  Control Frameworks > CSA CCM > Governance and Risk Management (GRM).


  Core Content Focus: Prioritize CSA CCM GRM controls (GRM-01 Policy: Establish governance policies; GRM-02 Organizational
  Alignment: Define roles/responsibilities; GRM-03 Risk Management Framework: Structured processes). Map to NIST CSF 2.0 Govern
  (GV) where relevant (e.g., GV.RM aligns with GRM-03). Include ERM integration, risk appetite, cloud-specific risks (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS).
