active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the potential consequences of skipping PS-6 access agreements during employee
    onboarding in a federal agency. How does this control uniquely contribute to personnel security compared to technical
    access controls like those in the AC family? Support your arguments with NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 references.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For multiple-choice cards (40% of deck): 4 options total – 1 correct, 3 distractors. Distractors must
    be plausible but incorrect: (1) From related controls (e.g., AC-2 ''account management'' instead of ''agreements''); (2)
    Common misconceptions (e.g., ''no review required'' vs. periodic); (3) Exaggerations/understatements (e.g., ''verbal agreement
    suffices'' vs. written). Ensure distractors promote analysis (e.g., confuse PS with AC family).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in NIST SP 800-53 cybersecurity controls. Generate a deck
  of 25 high-quality flashcards on ''Access Agreements (PS-6)'' strictly adhering to NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 PS-6: (a) Require
  personnel to agree in writing to access policies prior to access; (b) Review/update agreements [organization-defined frequency];
  (c) Protect agreements from unauthorized disclosure/modification. Topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management
  > Security Control Frameworks > NIST SP 800-53 Security and Privacy Controls > Personnel Security (PS) > Access Agreements
  (PS-6). IGNORE Access Control (AC) family emphasis; distinguish PS-6 as behavioral/personnel-focused.


  Incorporate pedagogy:

  - Learning objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active learning: Inspire cards that prep for discussions (e.g., risk scenarios), peer teaching (e.g., recite requirements),
  problem-solving (e.g., onboarding flows).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards: 25% Layer 1 (definitions), 25% Layer 2 (components a/b/c), 25% Layer 3 (implementation),
  25% Layer 4 (integration). [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING DESCRIPTION]


  Follow flashcard schema exactly: [INSERT FULL SCHEMA]. Balance: 30% basic Q&A, 30% cloze deletion, 40% multiple-choice.
  4-6 cards per Bloom''s level. Voter consensus: Prioritize accuracy/completeness on PS-6 only; quote NIST; scaffold pedagogy.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ...}, ...]. No additional text.'
