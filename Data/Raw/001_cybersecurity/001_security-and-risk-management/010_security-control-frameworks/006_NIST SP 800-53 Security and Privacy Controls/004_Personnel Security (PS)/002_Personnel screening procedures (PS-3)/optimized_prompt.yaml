active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the ethical balance between rigorous personnel screening (PS-3) and individual privacy rights
    in cybersecurity contexts. Cite real-world examples like insider threats in breaches (e.g., Edward Snowden) and evaluate
    trade-offs using NIST PS-3 requirements.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    but incorrect control (e.g., PS-4 instead of PS-3), 1 partial truth (e.g., low-risk only needs ID check). Ensure distractors
    are realistic, derived from topic (e.g., ITSG-33 vs NIST differences, related controls like MA-5).'
