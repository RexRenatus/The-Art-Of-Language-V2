  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the learning_objectives array above].

  - Active Learning: [paste active_learning object]. Tie explanations to these.

  - Scaffolding: [paste scaffolding object]. Distribute flashcards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 30% Layer 3, 20% Layer 4.

  - Ensure completeness: Cover OSA (as in scaffolding), full PS family links, misconceptions, examples (warnings to termination,
  e.g., phishing vs. data exfil).

  - Bloom''s progression: Balance flashcards across levels.


  Use Flashcard Schema: [paste flashcard_schema object]. Generate exactly 25 flashcards in JSON array format only. No intro
  text. Ensure high-quality, spaced repetition-friendly (active recall, varied formats). Base on NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 PS-8:
  formal process for sanctions on policy violations, notification. Voter consensus: 100% approval on pedagogy/scaffolding.'
