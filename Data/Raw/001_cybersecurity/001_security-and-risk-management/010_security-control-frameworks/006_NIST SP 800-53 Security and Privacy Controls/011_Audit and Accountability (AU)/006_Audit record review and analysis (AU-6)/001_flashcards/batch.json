      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "AU-6(6) correlates technical audit records with physical access monitoring, because combining these data sources provides a more comprehensive view for detecting anomalies. This control functions by linking digital access events with physical presence or actions, enabling the identification of suspicious behavior that might otherwise go unnoticed, such as unauthorized access attempts correlated with physical presence.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors suggest automation, replacement of technical analysis, or compliance, which do not capture the core function of correlating two distinct types of monitoring data for enhanced detection.",
        "analogy": "Correlating audit records with physical monitoring (AU-6(6)) is like a detective using both digital access logs (audit records) and security camera footage of someone's physical presence (physical monitoring) to confirm suspicious activity, rather than just automating the log review or relying solely on one type of evidence."
