active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a scenario where budget constraints limit storage, should an organization implement AU-4(1) transfer
    to alternate storage or risk overwriting logs? Debate the trade-offs using real-world breach examples like the SolarWinds
    incident where log availability was critical. Consider legal/compliance implications and peer responses.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST SP 800-53. Generate
  15 high-quality flashcards on ''Audit storage capacity planning (AU-4)'' in the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security
  And Risk Management > Security Control Frameworks > NIST SP 800-53 > Audit and Accountability (AU) > AU-4.


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ''learning_objectives'']

  - Scaffolding: Build cards progressively from Layer 1 (foundation) to Layer 4 (integration).

  - Active learning: Draw from discussion (budget trade-offs, SolarWinds), peer teaching (calculations, misconceptions), problem-solving
  (500-user scenario).

  - Research context: NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 AU-4 mandates sufficient storage for retention; supplemental guidance on log types;
  AU-4(1) transfer to alternate storage. Sources: NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (nist.gov), CIS Controls v8.

  Ensure pedagogical alignment: Cover all Bloom''s levels, misconceptions (e.g., cloud eliminates planning, confuse with AU-9),
  prior links (AU-2/AU-3). Output ONLY as a numbered markdown list of flashcards, each with ''Front:'' and ''Back:'' sections.
  No intro/outro.'
