active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the effectiveness of DNSSEC (as per SC-20/SC-21) versus alternative mitigations
    like DNS over HTTPS (DoH) in preventing real-world attacks such as DNS cache poisoning. Support arguments with NIST references
    and evaluate trade-offs for enterprise adoption.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST SP 800-53 controls.\
  \ Topic: Secure name/address resolution (SC-20, SC-21, SC-22) in System and Communications Protection (SC). Full hierarchy:\
  \ Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Control Frameworks > NIST SP 800-53 > SC > Secure name/address\
  \ resolution.\n\nCore content: SC-20 requires authoritative sources to provide DNSSEC signatures, cryptographic keys, child\
  \ zone status for chain-of-trust. SC-21 mandates recursive/caching resolvers to validate signatures, restrict to trusted\
  \ sources, request signed responses. SC-22 ensures detection/reporting of resolution failures/anomalies. Aligns with ITSG-33\
  \ Annex 3A (Canadian CCCS: cryptographic verification, integrity for authoritative/recursive services). Big picture: Prevents\
  \ DNS attacks (cache poisoning, Kaminsky) in zero-trust. Prerequisites: DNS basics (authoritative/recursive). Misconceptions:\
  \ Resolvers sign data (no), DNSSEC encrypts (no, signs only).\n\nIncorporate:\n- Learning objectives: [paste the 6 objectives\
