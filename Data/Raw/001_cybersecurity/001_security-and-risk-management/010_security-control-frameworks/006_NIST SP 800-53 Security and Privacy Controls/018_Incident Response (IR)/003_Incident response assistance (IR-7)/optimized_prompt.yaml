active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss scenarios where an internal incident response team should activate IR-7 assistance for system
    users (e.g., during a data breach). Compare NIST SP 800-61 phases (Preparation, Detection, Analysis, Containment, Eradication,
    Recovery) and debate pros/cons using examples like the Equifax breach (external coordination needs) vs. internal handling
    in smaller firms. What factors (e.g., resource limitations, incident severity) influence providing timely user support
    under IR-7?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives array here]

  - Active learning: Use discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving to inspire questions.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers (10-15 per layer): [INSERT scaffolding_layers here].

  - Prior knowledge: Assume basics from AU Detect, SP 800-61 phases.

  - Sources: NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (IR-7 text/enhancements), SP 800-61 Rev. 3, CSF 2.0 Respond, SANS Incident Handler''s Handbook
  (full phases), CREST CSIR Guide. Big picture: Internal user assistance for resilience.

  - Accuracy: IR-7 = org provides support to its users (not receiving external).


  Output 50 JSON flashcards in an array: [flashcard1, flashcard2, ...]. Follow exact schema: [INSERT flashcard_schema.structure
  here]. Span Bloom''s levels evenly. Ensure pedagogical depth, voter priorities (completeness, concept map, examples like
  Equifax).'
