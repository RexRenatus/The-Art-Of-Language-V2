active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between strict CM-3 compliance (e.g., full documentation and board approval) and
    agile development practices in a cloud environment. Consider real-world examples like the SolarWinds breach and how CM-3
    could have mitigated supply chain vulnerabilities.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST SP 800-53 controls.\
  \ Generate high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized flashcards for the topic: **Configuration Change Control (CM-3)**.\n\
  \n**Topic Hierarchy:** Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Control Frameworks > NIST SP 800-53 Security\

  - **Learning Objectives:** [Paste the full 'learning_objectives' array here].\n- **Scaffolding Layers:** Generate flashcards\
  \ distributed across 4 layers: [Paste full 'scaffolding_layers' object]. Ensure progression from foundation to integration.\n\
  - **Active Learning Ties:** Weave in references to [Paste full 'active_learning' object] (e.g., 'This tests the discussion\
