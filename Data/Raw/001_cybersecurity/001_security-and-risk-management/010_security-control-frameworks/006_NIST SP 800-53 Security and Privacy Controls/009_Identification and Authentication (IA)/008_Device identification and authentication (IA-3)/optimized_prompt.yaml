  discussion_prompt: In a Zero Trust Architecture, how does IA-3(1) remote device authentication mitigate risks from BYOD
    and IoT devices compared to traditional perimeter defenses? Debate pros/cons with evidence from NIST SP 800-53 and real-world
    breaches (e.g., Mirai botnet), aiming for consensus on best practices.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST SP 800-53. Generate\
  \ 25 high-quality flashcards for 'Device Identification and Authentication (IA-3)' using the provided schema.\n\n**Topic\
  \ Context:**\nHierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Control Frameworks > NIST SP 800-53 > IA\
  \ > IA-3.\nUse scaffolding layers, objectives, active learning, prior knowledge, big picture, concept map, misconceptions,\
  \ related concepts, sources exactly as provided.\n\n**Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list above]\n**Active Learning:**\
  \ Inspire cards from discussions/exercises (e.g., scenarios).\n**Scaffolding:** Distribute cards: 6 Layer1, 6 Layer2, 7\
  \ Layer3, 6 Layer4.\n**Bloom's Distribution:** As per objectives.\n\n**Output Format (JSON array of objects):**\n[\n  {\n\
