        "core_logic": "AC-6(4) 'Separate Processing Domains' supports least privilege by enabling finer-grained privilege allocation, because distinct domains can isolate processes and their associated privileges. This works by using virtualization or distinct system partitions to limit the scope of access.",

        "analogy": "Separate processing domains are like having different secure labs within a research facility, each with its own specific equipment and access controls, preventing cross-contamination of privileges."
