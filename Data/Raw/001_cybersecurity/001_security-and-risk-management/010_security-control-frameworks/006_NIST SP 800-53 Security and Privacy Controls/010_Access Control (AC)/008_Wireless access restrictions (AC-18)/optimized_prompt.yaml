active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a corporate office with a BYOD policy, should employees be permitted to use personal wireless hotspots?
    Debate the risks (e.g., rogue access points, signal leakage), mitigations (e.g., detection tools, power controls per AC-18),
    and alignment with NIST AC-18, considering usability vs. security trade-offs. Use real-world examples like hospital or
    public Wi-Fi scenarios.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active learning: Use discussion/peer/problem-solving in scenario cards.

  - Scaffolding: Tag cards by layer (L1 Foundation, L2 Components, etc.). Generate 40-50 cards: 10 L1 (remember/understand),
  15 L2/L3 (apply/analyze), 15-20 L4 (evaluate/create), 5-10 integration/active learning.


  Follow flashcard schema exactly:

  1. Basic Q/A: Front: {{Question}}. Back: {{Answer}}\nExplanation: {{details}} | Bloom: {{level}} | Layer: {{L#}} | Ref:

  3. Scenarios: Front: {{scenario prompt}}. Back: {{step-by-step}} | Ties to {{activity}}.


  Ensure cards are optimized for Anki/Spaced Repetition: concise fronts, detailed backs, active recall. Cover voter priorities:
  completeness (ITSG-33, enhancements), misconceptions, real-world (BYOD, hospital). Output as markdown list or JSON array
  of flashcards.'
