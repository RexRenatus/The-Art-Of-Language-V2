active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the pros and cons of using cloud services (e.g., AWS Glacier or Azure Backup) as alternate storage
    sites versus physical offsite facilities, considering NIST CP-6 requirements for geographic separation, security equivalence,
    RTO/RPO, cost, and compliance in regulated industries like healthcare.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (2) Partial truth (e.g., ''Security slightly less than primary''); (3) Extreme/unrealistic (e.g., ''No agreements needed'').
    Ensure distractors are plausible from voter-noted errors or research context. Vary difficulty by Bloom''s level.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST SP 800-53. Generate
  40-60 high-quality flashcards on ''Alternate Storage Sites (CP-6)'' in Contingency Planning (CP), following the exact schema
  provided. Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Control Frameworks > NIST SP 800-53 >
  Contingency Planning (CP) > Alternate Storage Sites (CP-6).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the full learning_objectives array here].

  - Active Learning: Tie 10% of cards to activities like hospital case study or cloud vs. physical debate.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4. Use provided scaffolding content.

  - Research Context: NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 CP-6 requires alternate site with geographic separation, equivalent security, agreements.
  Supports CIA Availability; links to CP-2, CP-9. CSF: Recover function via backups. Sources: NIST.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5,
  CSF 2.0.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each matching the flashcard_schema exactly (no extra text). Ensure university-level
  rigor: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, explanations reference NIST/Bloom''s. Balance Bloom''s levels per objectives.'
