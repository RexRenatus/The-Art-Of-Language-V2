active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a resource-constrained organization, debate which mission-essential functions should be prioritized
    in a CP-2 contingency plan and justify using risk assessment (RA) data and recovery objectives (RTO/RPO). Consider trade-offs
    with incident response (IR) priorities.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    testing/coordination, 3. Mix with backups/DR only (no full plan), 4. Ignore metrics/RTO. Ensure plausible (e.g., partial
    truths).'

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Active learning: [insert full active_learning above] – reference in explanations.

  - Scaffolding: Generate cards balanced across 4 layers [insert full scaffolding_layers above]; label each card with layer.


  Output 25 high-quality flashcards in JSON array format: [{''type'': ''multiple_choice|basic|cloze|scenario'', ''layer'':
  1-4, ''blooms_level'': ''REMEMBER|etc.'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''source'': ''...''}].
  Follow flashcard_schema exactly: Use distractor_protocol for MCQs. Ensure progressive difficulty mirroring Bloom''s. Cards
  must be accurate, measurable, and optimized for spaced repetition (concise, active recall).'
