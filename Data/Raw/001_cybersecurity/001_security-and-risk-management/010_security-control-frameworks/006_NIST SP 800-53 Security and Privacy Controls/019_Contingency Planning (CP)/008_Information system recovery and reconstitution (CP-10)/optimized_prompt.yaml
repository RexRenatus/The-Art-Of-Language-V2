active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how CP-10 ensures organizational resilience post-disruption (e.g., ransomware).
    Share real-world examples from incidents like the Colonial Pipeline attack, and connect to NIST CSF Recover function.
    What trade-offs exist between RTO/RPO and cost?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on voter-noted misconceptions: (1) Confuse recovery (restore
    functions) with reconstitution (full return/monitoring); (2) Mix up RTO (time) vs. RPO (data loss); (3) Overlook enhancements
    (e.g., ignore CP-10(2) transactions or CP-10(4) shutdown); (4) Common errors like assuming backups alone suffice without
    known state. Ensure distractors are realistic (e.g., ''Reconstitution only involves backups'' vs. correct full process).'

  - Learning objectives: [PASTE FULL learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]

  - Scaffolding layers: [PASTE FULL scaffolding OBJECT HERE]

  - Active learning: Embed higher-order cards with discussion/peer/problem-solving hooks.

  - Voter priorities: Align to Bloom''s progression (REMEMBER to CREATE), include enhancements (CP-10(2) transaction recovery,
  CP-10(4) shutdown/restart), complete NIST context (SP 800-53 Rev 5, CSF Recover, csf.tools/r), RTO/RPO, known state, links
  to CP-2/CP-6.

  - Core content: Recovery (restore functions post-disruption); Reconstitution (full ops, monitoring, reauth); Disruptions
  (cyber, failure); Sources: NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5.


  Generate flashcards using EXACT schema: [PASTE FULL flashcard_schema HERE]. Ensure 100% coverage: 4-5 cards per objective/Bloom
  level, 5 per scaffolding layer, distractors from protocol. Output ONLY the JSON array of flashcards, no extra text.'
