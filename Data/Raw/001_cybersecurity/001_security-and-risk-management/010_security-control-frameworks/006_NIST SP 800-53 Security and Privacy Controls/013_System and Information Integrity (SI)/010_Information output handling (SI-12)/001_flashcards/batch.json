        "core_logic": "SI-12 explicitly lists policies, procedures, plans, reports, and data output from control implementation as information that may require management and retention, because these are crucial for compliance and audits.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly include items explicitly mentioned in the NIST SP 800-53 SI-12 discussion, while the correct answer represents a type of data typically managed separately for performance monitoring, not long-term retention under SI-12.",
        "analogy": "Imagine a company's HR department: they retain employee handbooks (policies), training records (procedures), and performance reviews (data output), but not the real-time dashboard showing current employee activity (performance metrics)."
