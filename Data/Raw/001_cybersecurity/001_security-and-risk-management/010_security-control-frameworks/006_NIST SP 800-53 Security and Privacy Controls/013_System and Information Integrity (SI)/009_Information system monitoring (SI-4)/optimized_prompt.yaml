active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios might excessive system monitoring lead to privacy violations, and how can organizations
    balance security (SI-4) with ethical considerations? Debate using real-world examples like corporate surveillance scandals
    (e.g., Cambridge Analytica or Equifax breach responses).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
