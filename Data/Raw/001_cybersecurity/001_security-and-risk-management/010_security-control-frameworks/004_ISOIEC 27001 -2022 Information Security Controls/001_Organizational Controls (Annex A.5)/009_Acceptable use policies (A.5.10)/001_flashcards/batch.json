        "core_logic": "ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A.5.10 implies that policies, including the AUP, must be reviewed at planned intervals and if significant changes occur. This is crucial because the threat landscape, technology, and organizational context evolve, and regular reviews ensure the AUP remains relevant, effective, and aligned with current risks and requirements.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors suggest inappropriate review authorities, insufficient triggers for updates, or a lack of review altogether, all of which would render the AUP ineffective over time.",
        "analogy": "Reviewing an AUP is like updating your car's maintenance schedule – you need to do it regularly and also after any major repairs or modifications to keep it running smoothly and safely."
