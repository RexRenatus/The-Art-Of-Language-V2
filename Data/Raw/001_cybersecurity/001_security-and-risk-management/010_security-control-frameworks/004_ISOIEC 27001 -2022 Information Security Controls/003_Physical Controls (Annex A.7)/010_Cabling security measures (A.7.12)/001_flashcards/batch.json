        "core_logic": "Australian guidelines specify that TOP SECRET cables should not be run in party walls in shared facilities to maintain security and prevent potential compromise, but can use an inner wall if inspectability is maintained.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The correct answer reflects a specific security guideline for TOP SECRET cables in shared environments. Distractors suggest visible conduits (which may not be secure), bundling (a security risk), or prioritizing direct paths over security constraints.",
        "analogy": "For highly sensitive TOP SECRET information, it's like avoiding shared walls in an apartment building for your secure vault; you'd prefer a dedicated, internal, and inspectable space to ensure maximum security."
