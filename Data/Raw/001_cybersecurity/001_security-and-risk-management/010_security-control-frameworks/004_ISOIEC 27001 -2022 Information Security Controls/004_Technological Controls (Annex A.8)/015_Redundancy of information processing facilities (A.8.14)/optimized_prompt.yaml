active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether full redundancy (e.g., mirrored data centers) is always necessary for
    all organizations or if risk-based approaches suffice, using real-world examples from healthcare (critical availability)
    vs. e-commerce (cost-sensitive scalability). Reference ISO/IEC 27001:2022 A.8.14 and CIA triad.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol:
  - Base on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Redundancy guarantees 100% uptime' as distractor).
  - Use partial truths (e.g., 'Only hardware redundancy needed' ignoring software/site).
  - Include extremes (e.g., 'No redundancy ever needed'), similar terms (e.g., confuse failover with backup), or unrelated
    concepts (e.g., mix with Confidentiality).
  - Ensure 3 distractors per MCQ; one closest to correct for higher difficulty.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ISO/IEC 27001:2022. Generate
  high-quality, Anki-optimized flashcards for the topic ''Redundancy of information processing facilities (A.8.14)'' in Cybersecurity
  > Security And Risk Management > Security Control Frameworks > ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Information Security Controls > Technological
  Controls (Annex A.8).


  Core content: ISO A.8.14 requires IPFs (ICT infrastructure) with redundancy to meet availability needs, preventing single
  points of failure via duplication (e.g., RAID, failover clusters, geo-redundant DCs; active-active/passive). Supports CIA
  Availability and business continuity/DRP. Steps: assess RTO/RPO, design/implement/test failover. Misconceptions: !=100%
  uptime; not just hardware.


  Prior knowledge: CIA triad (Availability), risk assessment, IT basics (servers, networks).
