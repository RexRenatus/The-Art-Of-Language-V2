  Incorporate these learning objectives [INSERT learning_objectives array], active learning components [INSERT active_learning_components
  array], and scaffolding layers [INSERT scaffolding_layers array].


  Generate 75 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema [INSERT flashcard_generation_schema]. Ensure coverage: 25% Layer
  1 (REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND), 25% Layer 2 (UNDERSTAND/APPLY), 25% Layer 3 (APPLY/ANALYZE), 25% Layer 4 (ANALYZE/EVALUATE/CREATE).
  Include NIST SP 800-53 CP-9 details (backups of user/system info at defined frequency, offsite/encrypted storage, testing),
  best practices (3-2-1 rule, immutability, tools like Veeam/AWS Backup), RPO/RTO, data classification.


  Key content: ISO A.8.13 - ''Backup copies of information, software, and systems shall be taken and tested regularly.'' Protect
  CIA triad via procedures for frequency, storage, encryption, testing, retention.
