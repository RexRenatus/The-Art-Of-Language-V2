active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages of using the PDCA cycle in ISO/IEC 27001 compared to a linear
    security framework like NIST CSF. How does PDCA's iterative nature better operationalize the CIA triad in dynamic threat
    landscapes? Provide examples from recent breaches (e.g., SolarWinds).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    as ''Do'' instead of ''Plan''); 2) Mix standards (e.g., NIST terms); 3) Misalign CIA (e.g., Availability as Confidentiality).
    Ensure distractors teach via explanation. Aim for 40% cards MCQ, 30% Q&A, 30% Cloze.'
