active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between continuous monitoring (ISCM) and traditional periodic assessments in a
    resource-constrained organization. Which approach better supports Ongoing Authorization (OA), and why? Use NIST SP 800-137
    to support your arguments, considering factors like cost, threat responsiveness, and compliance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Core Content (from NIST SP 800-137 and RMF): ISCM maintains ongoing security awareness for risk decisions. Key: RMF Monitor
  step; OA (continuous auth); Org levels (1: Organization, 2: Mission/Business Process, 3: System). Steps: Define strategy,
  select controls/metrics, implement, analyze, report, respond/improve. ISCM program assessment evaluates program effectiveness.
  Links: FISMA, CMMC. Real-world: E-commerce threats; DoD successes/failures.


  Use this optimized pedagogy:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Incorporate discussion (trade-offs), peer teaching (org levels), problem-solving (e.g., e-commerce scenario).

  - Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL 4 LAYERS FROM ABOVE].

  - Prerequisites: Basic risk mgmt.

  - Concept Map: ISCM central → RMF (Monitor) → OA → Org Levels 1-3 → NIST Steps → Frameworks (FISMA).


  Generate 20-30 flashcards EXACTLY in the schema: JSON array of objects with ''front'' (question + hints) and ''back'' (answer,
  3 distractors, explanation, source, bloom_level, layer). Balance per rules. Ensure university-level: Bloom''s progression,
  active recall, misconceptions via distractors. Voter consensus: 82.9% approval. Output ONLY the JSON array, no extras.'
