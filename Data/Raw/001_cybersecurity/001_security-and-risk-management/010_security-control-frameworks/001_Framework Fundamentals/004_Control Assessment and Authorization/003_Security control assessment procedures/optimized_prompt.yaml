active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between assessment methods (examine, interview, test) for
    evaluating access control (AC-2) in a cloud environment. How do organizational constraints like budget and time influence
    method selection? Reference NIST SP 800-53A Rev. 5 and share real-world examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., outdated Rev. 4 methods), (3) Related but wrong concepts (e.g., RMF Step 3 vs. Step 4), (4) Voter-suggested gaps
    (e.g., ignore privacy controls). Ensure 70% plausibility to challenge learners.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST frameworks. Generate
  50 high-quality flashcards on ''Security control assessment procedures'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And
  Risk Management > Security Control Frameworks > Framework Fundamentals > Control Assessment and Authorization > Security
  control assessment procedures).


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use as inspiration for application hints.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers (12-13 per layer 1-3, rest in layer 4). Tag each card with layer and Bloom''s
  level.

  - Sources: NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf), SP 800-53A
  Rev. 5 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53Ar5.pdf), SP 800-37 Rev. 2 (RMF).

  - Best Practices: Full NIST SP 800-53A process (plan → procedures: method-object-determination → findings → report). Concept
  map: Central ''Assessment Procedures''.

  - Prerequisites: Link to security controls and RMF basics.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly:

  Vary types: 40% cloze/basic recall (Layer 1), 30% apply/analyze (Layers 2-3), 30% evaluate/create (Layer 4). Ensure progressive
  complexity, voter consensus (completeness, pedagogy). Output as markdown list: ### Card 1
