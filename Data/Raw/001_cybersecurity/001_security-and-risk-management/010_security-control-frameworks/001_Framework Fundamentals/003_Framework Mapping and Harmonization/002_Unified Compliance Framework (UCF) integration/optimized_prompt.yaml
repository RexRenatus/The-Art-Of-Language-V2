active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group, debate the pros and cons of adopting UCF for an organization already compliant with NIST
    CSF and ISO 27001. Identify potential misconceptions (e.g., UCF replaces frameworks rather than harmonizing them) and
    provide examples/non-examples of common controls across frameworks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    ''UCF is a hardware tool''). Ensure plausible ones test analysis/evaluation.'

  **Content Sources (Use Exactly, Complete Truncated Parts):** Research Summary: UCF is a metaframework harmonizing regs (NIST
  CSF: risk mgmt framework with 5 functions; ISO 27001: 114 controls in 14 domains; GDPR/HIPAA examples). Common Controls
  address multiples; Authority Documents are sources. ''Build once, comply many'' reduces costs 30-50%. Full Sources: securityboulevard.com/2025/07/how-to-build...,
