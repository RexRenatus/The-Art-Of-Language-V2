active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages and challenges of adopting multi-framework compliance versus
    a single-framework approach. Use real-world examples (e.g., a financial institution needing PCI DSS and SOC 2) to argue
    how harmonization impacts operational resilience and GRC mastery. Cite overlaps or conflicts between NIST CSF and ISO
    27001.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate plausible distractors based on: 1. Common misconceptions (e.g., ''NIST CSF is certification-based''
    vs. voluntary); 2. Partial truths (e.g., overlapping but incomplete mappings); 3. Framework confusions (e.g., mix PCI
    DSS with SOC 2 criteria); 4. Edge cases (e.g., conflicts like ISO''s risk-based vs. PCI''s prescriptive). Ensure distractors
    teach by contrast.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Multi-framework compliance
  strategies'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Control Frameworks > Framework Fundamentals
  > Framework Mapping and Harmonization). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (objectives: [insert learning_objectives
  array]), active learning ([insert active_learning keys]), scaffolding layers ([insert scaffolding_layers array]). Incorporate
  voter consensus (completeness on frameworks: NIST CSF, ISO 27001, CIS Controls, PCI DSS, SOC 2; strategies: mapping, gap
  analysis, harmonization; prior knowledge: individual frameworks; big picture: GRC/resilience; concept map). Research context:
  Core concepts (multi-framework compliance, ISMS, controls); truncated standards completed with mappings/examples.


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (balanced across Bloom''s levels and layers; 40% Layer 1-2, 40% Layer 3, 20% Layer 4).
  Follow exact schema: [insert flashcard_schema]. Ensure progressive complexity, measurable outcomes, web-grounded (e.g.,
  NIST mappings). Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''blooms_level'': ''...'', ''layer'':
  ''...''}]. No extras.'
