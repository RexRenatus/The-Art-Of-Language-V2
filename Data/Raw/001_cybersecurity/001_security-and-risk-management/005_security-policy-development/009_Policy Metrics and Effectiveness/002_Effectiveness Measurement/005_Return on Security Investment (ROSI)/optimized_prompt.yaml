active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the strengths and limitations of ROSI compared to traditional ROI in cybersecurity budgeting.
    Provide examples from real-world breaches like Equifax (2017 data breach costing ~$1.4B) or SolarWinds (2020 supply chain
    attack) to support your arguments, considering how ROSI better captures loss avoidance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ (4 options: 1 correct, 3 distractors): Create plausible errors from misconceptions e.g., 1)
    Use ROI formula (gain/cost without risk reduction); 2) Forget indirect costs in SLE; 3) Miscalculate ALE (e.g., ARO ×
    SLE wrong); 4) Ignore post-investment ALE. Base on voter priorities like ARO/SLE estimation errors or confusing ROSI/ROI.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Return on Security Investment
  (ROSI) under Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Policy Development > Policy Metrics
  and Effectiveness > Effectiveness Measurement > ROSI. Voter consensus (100% approval, 7 voters) emphasizes completeness
  (NIST, ISO 27001, FAIR standards), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression, examples), and activities.


  Core content from research: ROSI = [(ALE_before - ALE_after) - Cost] / Cost × 100%; ALE = SLE × ARO; ROSI focuses on risk
  reduction vs. ROI profit. Include limitations (ARO/SLE estimation), examples (Equifax, numerical scenarios).
