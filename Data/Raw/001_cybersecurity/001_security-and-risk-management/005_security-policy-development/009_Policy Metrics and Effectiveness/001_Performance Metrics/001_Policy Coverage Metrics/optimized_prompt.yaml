  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the following: ''How can policy coverage metrics like ''% of employees
    who have acknowledged the policy'' reveal hidden risks in an organization''s security posture? Provide real-world examples
    and counterarguments.'' Encourage critical thinking by requiring evidence from NIST SP 800-55.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors from: 1) Misconceptions (e.g., equating coverage to full compliance); 2) Partial
    truths (e.g., correct metric but wrong framework); 3) Edge cases (e.g., outdated NIST version); 4) Voter-suggested examples
    (e.g., training rates vs. enforcement). Ensure plausibility for active recall testing.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Policy Coverage Metrics\
