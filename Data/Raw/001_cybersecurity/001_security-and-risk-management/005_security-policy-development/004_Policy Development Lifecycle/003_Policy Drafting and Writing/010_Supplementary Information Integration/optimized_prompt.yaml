active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages and challenges of integrating supplementary information
    like NIST CSF Framework Profiles and C-SCRM guidelines into security policies during the drafting phase. Provide real-world
    examples from recent supply chain breaches (e.g., SolarWinds) and propose how Profiles can bridge policy to implementation.
    Synthesize group consensus into a shared mind map.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Topic: ''Supplementary Information Integration'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Policy
  Development > Policy Development Lifecycle > Policy Drafting and Writing > Supplementary Information Integration). Use this
  completed research context:


  Core Concepts:

  - C-SCRM: Systematic management of cybersecurity risks in ICT supply chains (NIST SP 800-161r1).

  - Supply Chain Ecosystem: Entities from R&D to disposal.

  - NIST CSF: Risk management framework.

  - Framework Core: 5 Functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) with categories/subcategories.

  - Framework Profiles: Alignments of organizational activities to Core (current/baseline vs. target profiles for policy customization).

  - Framework Tiers: 1 (Partial), 2 (Risk Informed), 3 (Repeatable), 4 (Adaptive) for maturity.


  Supplementary Information Integration: Incorporating these (e.g., CSF Profiles, C-SCRM) as citations, references, appendices
  in policy drafting to guide implementation.


  Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (nist.gov/cyberframework), NIST SP 800-161r1 (C-SCRM), NIST SP 1305, BitSight cybersecurity frameworks
