  Generate 20 high-quality flashcards on ''Roles and Responsibilities Assignment'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security
  And Risk Management > Security Policy Development > Policy Development Lifecycle > Policy Drafting and Writing > Roles and
  Responsibilities Assignment).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL active_learning_components ARRAY HERE]

  - Scaffolding: Structure flashcards across 4 layers [INSERT FULL scaffolding_layers ARRAY HERE]. Aim for 5 flashcards per
  layer.

  - Cover all Bloom''s levels proportionally (3-4 per level).

  - Research Context: Effective role assignment ensures accountability in security tasks. Key framework: NIST RMF (SP 800-37
  Rev. 2). Full roles as in Layer 2. Sources: NIST SP 800-37r2 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-37r2), RMF Roles Crosswalk

  Guidelines:

  - Questions: Varied types (MCQ, T/F, fill-blank) for active recall.

  - Distractors: Strictly 3, plausible, misconception-based.

  - Explanations: Tie to objectives/active learning/scaffolding/sources; promote deeper thinking.

  - Balance: Foundation (Layer 1) for remember/understand; advanced for evaluate/create.

  - Pedagogy: Scaffold from simple recall to application/analysis.'
