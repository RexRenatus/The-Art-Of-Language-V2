This validated classification influences all subsequent design and safety decisions (controls, risk acceptance) and is revisited if the building's use changes significantly (reauthorization)."

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The system disposal strategy is important because it ensures secure decommissioning, preventing data breaches and maintaining compliance, which indirectly impacts reauthorization by closing out the lifecycle of a system and informing the authorization of its replacement. This process works by defining secure data handling and asset management procedures during removal, connecting lifecycle management to overall security posture.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors misrepresent disposal by suggesting it leads to immediate replacement authorization, indefinite data archiving, or a final operational assessment, failing to capture its focus on secure and compliant system removal.",
        "analogy": "A system disposal strategy is like the process of safely closing down a construction site; it involves removing equipment securely, cleaning up the area (data sanitization), and updating property records (inventory), ensuring the site is left safe and compliant before any new construction (replacement system authorization) begins."
