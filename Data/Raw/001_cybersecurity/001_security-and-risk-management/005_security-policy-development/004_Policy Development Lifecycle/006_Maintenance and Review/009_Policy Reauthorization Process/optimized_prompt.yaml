active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given the rapid evolution of cybersecurity threats, such as supply chain attacks highlighted in NIST
    CSF 2.0, debate the optimal frequency and triggers for policy reauthorization (e.g., annual vs. event-driven). Use RMF
    continuous monitoring (NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2) to support arguments and consider real-world implications for organizational
    risk posture.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (2) Partial truth (e.g., confuses RMF with CSF), (3) Extreme/unrealistic option (e.g., ''never reauthorize''). Ensure
    plausibility from research context.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security and Risk Management.
  Generate 24 high-quality flashcards (6 per scaffolding layer) on the topic ''Policy Reauthorization Process'' (Topic Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Policy Development > Policy Development Lifecycle > Maintenance
  and Review > Policy Reauthorization Process). Ensure even coverage of Bloom''s Taxonomy learning objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives
  ARRAY HERE]. Incorporate scaffolding layers progressively: [INSERT scaffolding OBJECT HERE]. Draw from research context:
  NIST RMF (SP 800-37 Rev. 2: continuous monitoring key to reauthorization); NIST CSF 2.0 (governance, supply chain risks);
  adaptive risk management to counter evolving threats like ransomware.


  Use the exact flashcard_schema JSON structure for each card. Vary types: QA for foundation, MCQ for components/implementation,
  open-ended for integration. Strictly follow distractor_protocol. Tie explanations to objectives, layers, and active learning
  elements like [briefly reference discussion/peer/problem-solving]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 24 flashcards, e.g., [{''id'':
  ''card_001'', ...}, ...]. No additional text.'
