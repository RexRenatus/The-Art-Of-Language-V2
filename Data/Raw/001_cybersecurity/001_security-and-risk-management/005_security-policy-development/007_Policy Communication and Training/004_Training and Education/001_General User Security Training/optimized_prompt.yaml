active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In small groups, discuss real-world breaches caused by human error (e.g., phishing at Equifax or Twitter).
    Analyze why training failed and propose voter-suggested improvements like interactive simulations. Share and debate consensus
    solutions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    ''Awareness = skills training''), (2) Partial truth/opposite (e.g., ''Training only for IT staff''), (3) Plausible but
    wrong detail (e.g., wrong NIST step). Ensure plausible to test analysis. Balance coverage: 30% Layer1, 25% Layer2, 25%

  **Full Synthesized Content (complete from NIST/ISO/web sources):** Core: Awareness (what/why), Training (how/skills), Education
  (depth). Human weakest link; topics: phishing/passwords/social eng./reporting. NIST SP 800-50 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-50.pdf):
  Manage, Automate, Audience/Content, Deliver (sims/eLearn), Evaluate (quizzes/incidents), Maintain. NIST SP 800-12 Ch13 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Series/sp800-12/final/sp800-12.pdf):

  SP 800-53 AT controls. CIS Controls v8 #14. Best practices: Interactive sims, gamification, metrics (90% pass, <5% phishing
  clicks). Sources: NIST 800-50/12/53, ISO 27001, SANS.org/training.


  Incorporate pedagogy: Build on prior threats (phishing). Ensure university-style: active recall, misconceptions via distractors.
