active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a company facing frequent insider threats from privileged users, debate whether mandatory annual role-based
    training (per NIST SP 800-50) suffices or if continuous micro-learning modules are essential. Support arguments with PAM
    best practices from NIST SP 1800-18 and address misconceptions like 'privileged users don't need MFA'.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one partner explains privileged user risks and 'teach-back' a specific PAM control from NIST SP
    1800-18 (e.g., just-in-time access); switch roles and provide feedback on accuracy and clarity.
  problem_solving: Analyze the Colonial Pipeline breach (2021), caused by compromised privileged credentials. In groups, design
    a training program with metrics (e.g., NIST SP 800-53 AT-4 training effectiveness), including role-play of access request
    scenarios and countermeasures like least privilege.

    is only passwords (ignore behavior/training); 2) All employees need identical training (ignore role-based); 3) No need
    for ongoing/MFA training (one-time suffices); 4) NIST SP 800-50 is for general IT only (not privileged). Ensure distractors

  **Research Context (Complete Summary):** Privileged User Training focuses on educating users with elevated access. Core
  Concepts: Privileged User (elevated access, ''keys to the kingdom'' - RIT.edu); PAM (secure/control privileged accounts
  - NIST SP 1800-18); CPLP (workforce education - NIST SP 800-50 Rev.1); Role-Based Training (tailored to roles - GSA.gov).
  Standards: NIST SP 800-50 Rev.1 (lifecycle: plan, develop, implement, evaluate); NIST SP 800-53 Rev.5 (AT-2 Role-Based Training,
  AT-3 Frequency, AT-4 Effectiveness, integrated with PAM controls like AC-6 Least Privilege). Best Practices: Just-in-time
  access, simulations, metrics. Misconceptions: Only passwords matter; uniform training; no MFA/ongoing needs. Sources: NIST
  SP 800-50r1 (csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/50/r1), SP 800-53r5 (doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r5), SP 1800-18 (nccoe.nist.gov),
  RIT.edu/security, GSA.gov Security Training.
