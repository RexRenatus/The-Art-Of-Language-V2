active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate whether training completion tracking should be linked to employee performance reviews or disciplinary
    actions. Use NIST SP 800-50 guidelines to support your position—what are the risks (e.g., resentment impacting culture)
    and benefits (e.g., accountability for compliance)?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Distractors must be plausible and based on common misconceptions: (1) Superficially similar terms
    (e.g., ''awareness training'' vs. ''role-based''), (2) Outdated/incorrect frameworks (e.g., NIST SP 800-53 instead of
    800-50), (3) Extreme values (e.g., 100% completion as always ideal ignores culture risks), (4) Confuse metrics (e.g.,
    ''quiz scores'' as completion proxy). Ensure 1-2 distractors are ''almost right'' to test analysis.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security and Risk Management
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Policy Development > Policy Communication and
  Training > Training and Education > Training Completion Tracking). Generate 40 high-quality flashcards optimized for spaced
  repetition and active recall, covering all provided elements below. Ensure even distribution: 1/6 per Bloom''s objective,
  1/4 per scaffolding layer, integrate voter priorities (NICE Framework full summary: NIST SP 800-181 categorizes workforce
  into 7 areas/52 roles for tailored tracking; NIST SP 800-50 for awareness metrics; GDPR/CCPA examples).


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list from JSON]

  **Active Learning:** [Insert full active_learning from JSON] – Tie flashcards to these for application.

  **Scaffolding:** [Insert full scaffolding from JSON] – Label each card''s layer.

  **Core Content:** Expand research: Core concepts (definitions), standards (NIST SP 800-50: track participation/assessments;
  SP 800-181 NICE: role mapping), best practices (LMS automation, metrics dashboards, culture integration), examples (65%
  completion scenario).


  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly follow [Insert full flashcard_schema from JSON]. Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''MCQ|Q&A|Cloze'',
  ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''blooms_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'':
  ''...'', ''source'': ''...''}}]. No duplicates; vary phrasing for mastery.'
