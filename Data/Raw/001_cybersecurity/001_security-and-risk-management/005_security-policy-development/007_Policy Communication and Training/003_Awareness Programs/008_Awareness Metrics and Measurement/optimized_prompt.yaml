active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of relying solely on quantitative metrics (e.g., phishing
    click-through rates) versus incorporating qualitative measures (e.g., employee feedback surveys) for awareness programs.
    Use NIST SP 800-55 to support arguments and propose a balanced approach for a mid-sized company facing budget constraints.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions: 1) Confuse Measures vs. Metrics
    (e.g., treat raw data as analyzed insight); 2) Ignore qualitative/prioritization (e.g., overemphasize quantitative only);
    3) Misapply NIST steps/examples (e.g., wrong metric for phishing scenario, omit SMART/baselines). Ensure distractors are
    realistic from voter pedagogy (e.g., incomplete best practices).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Awareness Metrics and Measurement
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Policy Development > Policy Communication and
  Training > Awareness Programs > Awareness Metrics and Measurement). Voter consensus: 100% approval on completeness (NIST
  SP 800-55 best practices), pedagogy (Bloom''s, examples like phishing rates/quiz scores), scaffolding, etc.


  Use this optimized content structure:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert the 6 objectives above]

  - Scaffolding: [insert the 4 layers above]

  - Active Learning: Incorporate elements (e.g., scenario prompts) into flashcards where relevant.

  - Sources: NIST SP 800-55 Vol 1 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-55v1.pdf).


  Generate exactly 24 flashcards (4 per Bloom''s level, balanced across 4 scaffolding layers) in a JSON array of objects matching
  this EXACT schema: [insert flashcard_schema structure above].


  Rules:

  - Cover all objectives/layers comprehensively (e.g., Layer 1: definitions/concept map; Layer 3: steps/examples/best practices;
  Layer 4: integration).

  - 70% MCQ with distractors per protocol; 30% Short Answer for CREATE/EVALUATE.

  - Questions promote active recall: scenario-based for APPLY+, misconception-driven.

  - Ensure university pedagogy: Scaffolded progression, measurable verbs, real-world cybersecurity application.

  - Output ONLY the JSON array, no extra text.'
