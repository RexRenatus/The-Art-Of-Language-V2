active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student acts as the Business Unit Liaison teaching the NIST CSF Govern function to a 'business
    peer' (the other student); explain its relevance to policy communication. Switch roles and provide feedback on clarity,
    alignment with business needs, and use of ISO 27001 concepts.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A Marketing unit wants to use a shadow IT tool for campaigns, risking data leaks. Design a risk-assessed
    integration plan as the Liaison, using NIST Identify (risk assessment) and Protect (controls) functions. Include stakeholder
    engagement steps and ISO 27002 control mappings.'

  Generate 24-32 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet using university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (cover all
  6 objectives provided), active learning (inspire discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving), 4-layer scaffolding (foundation
  to integration), and spaced repetition best practices.


  **Context/Content:**

  - Business Unit Liaison: Bridge translating security (NIST CSF 2.0: Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover)
  to business units (e.g., Sales); aligns policies per ISO 27001 (ISMS establishment/improvement) & ISO 27002 (Annex A controls
  for communication/training).

  - Prior knowledge: Basic cybersecurity, risk assessment, stakeholders.

  - Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (nist.gov/cyberframework), ISO 27001/27002 (iso.org), real-world ex: Retail CRM compliance.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives here]

  **Active Learning:** Use for explanations/tie-ins: [Insert discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving here]

  **Scaffolding Layers:** Generate 5-8 cards per layer: [Insert full scaffolding details here]


  **Output Format (JSON array of flashcards):** Each card: {"id":1, "layer":"1_foundation", "blooms_level":"remember", "front":"Question
  text (MC if applicable: A/B/C/D)", "back":{"answer":"Correct (e.g., A)", "explanation":"Detailed... (link standards/objectives)",
  "references":["NIST CSF Govern"], "active_tie_in":"Relates to Sales VP discussion"}}


  **Flashcard Rules:**

  - [Insert full flashcard_schema here]

  - Ensure active, measurable: Use action verbs.

  - Distractors per protocol.

  - Varied: 40% MC, 30% Q/A recall, 30% scenarios.

  - Educational: Explanations scaffold learning.
