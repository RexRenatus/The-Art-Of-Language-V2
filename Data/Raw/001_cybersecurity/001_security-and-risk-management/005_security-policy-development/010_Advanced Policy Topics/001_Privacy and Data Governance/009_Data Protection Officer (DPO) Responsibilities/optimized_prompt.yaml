active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a scenario where a multinational tech company processes health data globally but operates outside
    the EU/UK, should they appoint a DPO voluntarily? Argue pros/cons considering regulatory trends like emerging privacy
    laws in the US (e.g., CCPA) and ethical responsibilities. This addresses misconceptions that DPO roles are only EU-mandated.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
