        "core_logic": "Containment is a critical phase in incident handling (IR-4) because it involves immediate actions to limit the spread and impact of an incident, thereby preventing further damage and facilitating subsequent eradication and recovery.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors represent other distinct phases of incident response, each with a different primary objective than limiting the immediate scope of an incident.",
        "analogy": "In a fire emergency, containment is like closing the doors to the burning room to prevent the fire from spreading to other parts of the building before firefighters arrive to extinguish it."
