active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how scoping considerations differ for a healthcare organization (HIPAA-compliant)
    versus a fintech startup (PCI-DSS focused). Consider impacts on risk tolerance and NIST CSF ID.RA subcategories. Support
    arguments with real-world examples and evaluate trade-offs in control tailoring.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors that are: (1) Semantically similar but factually wrong (e.g., swap ID.RA subcategories),
    (2) Reflect real misconceptions (e.g., scoping ignores ERM), (3) Vary difficulty (one obvious, two challenging), (4) Avoid
    randomness—ground in research context or common errors.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in 'Scoping Considerations\
