active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In groups, debate common misconceptions about authorization boundaries (e.g., confusing them with network
    perimeters or system boundaries that ignore people/processes). Justify why NIST SP 800-37 emphasizes explicit inclusions/exclusions,
    using real-world examples like cloud-hybrid environments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the exact array from ''learning_objectives'']

  - Active Learning: Use elements like diagramming, misconceptions in explanations. [reference components]

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers: [paste exact scaffolding descriptions]. Include concept map references.

  - Research Context: NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2 (Prepare Task P-11, Ch. 2-3); SP 800-39 (enterprise risk); CSRC glossary. Definitions:
  Authorization boundary = components authorized by AO, excludes connected systems; System elements = HW/SW/firmware/people/processes.


  Output 25 flashcards in JSON array format, strictly following the Flashcard Schema: [paste exact schema]. Ensure:

  - Balance: ~20% per Bloom''s level, ~25% per layer.

  - Variety: 60% MCQ (with distractors), 40% open Q&A.

  - Pedagogy: Active recall, scaffolding progression, measurable verbs.

  - Voter Priorities: Hands-on diagramming prompts, misconceptions, examples/case studies, prior links.
