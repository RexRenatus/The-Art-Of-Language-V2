active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how technical controls (e.g., firewalls vs. encryption) differ from administrative
    controls and evaluate their role in achieving CIA triad objectives. Provide real-world examples from recent breaches and
    propose improvements.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors that are: 1) Semantically similar but incorrect (e.g., name wrong CSF function);
    2) Based on real misconceptions (e.g., ''Technical controls replace policy'' as distractor); 3) Plausible from partial
    knowledge (e.g., list only 5 CSF functions); 4) Drawn from research context (e.g., mix NIST 800-53 with non-technical
    controls). Ensure one distractor per common error type.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, 4-layer scaffolding). Generate high-quality Anki-style flashcards for the topic ''Technical
  Controls Implementation'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Policy Development > Policy
  Implementation and Integration > Technical Control Implementation > Technical Controls Implementation). Use this comprehensive
  content summary drawn from NIST CSF 2.0, NIST SP 800-53, and web research:


  Core Concepts: Technical controls are tech safeguards for CIA triad (Confidentiality: encryption; Integrity: hashing; Availability:
  redundancy). Frameworks: NIST CSF functions - Identify (risk understanding), Protect (safeguards: PR.AC access control e.g.
  firewalls/MFA; PR.DS data security e.g. encryption; PR.AT training), Detect (DE: IDS/SIEM for anomalies), Respond (RS: incident
  response tools to contain/eradicate), Recover (RC: backups/restoration), Govern (GV: strategy oversight). Best practices:
  Step-by-step implementation, integration with policy, examples address misconceptions.

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the array above]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste the array above]

  - Active Learning: Inspire questions from activities (e.g., scenario from problem-solving).

  - Voter Consensus (82.9%): Ensure completeness (full CSF functions), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression, CIA links), examples.


  Output EXACTLY a JSON array of 30 flashcards, each as: {"front": "question text", "back": "answer", "explanation": "detailed
  rationale with NIST refs", "bloom_level": "e.g. Apply", "scaffolding_layer": 2, "distractors": ["d1", "d2", "d3"]}. Ensure
  variety, no duplicates, web-grounded accuracy, and distractors per protocol. Cover all objectives/layers evenly.'
