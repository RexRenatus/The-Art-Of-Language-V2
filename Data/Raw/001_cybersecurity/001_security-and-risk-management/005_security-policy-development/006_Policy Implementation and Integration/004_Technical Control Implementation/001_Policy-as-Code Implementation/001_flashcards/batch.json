        "core_logic": "The 'effect' characteristic specifies the outcome of a policy rule evaluation (e.g., audit, deny, modify) because it dictates the system's action, which is fundamental to how PaC enforces security and risk management objectives.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly identify other policy characteristics (scope, parameters, template info) as defining the policy's outcome, missing the role of 'effect'.",
        "analogy": "In a Policy-as-Code rule, the 'effect' is the consequence – like 'audit' for non-compliance, 'deny' for a forbidden action, or 'modify' to enforce a setting."
