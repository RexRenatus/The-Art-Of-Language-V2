active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a DevSecOps environment, should security policies in IaC be enforced as 'hard fails' in CI/CD pipelines
    (blocking deployments on violations) or allow overrides with manual approvals? Debate the risks and benefits, drawing
    from real-world breaches like the Capital One incident (2019), where misconfigurations in IaC contributed to exposure.
    Consider trade-offs in velocity vs. security.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    IaC vs. Config as Code); (2) Outdated/wrong standard (e.g., PCI-DSS instead of NIST for CSF context); (3) Partial truth
    (e.g., ''Manual review only'' vs. automated PaC). Ensure distractors teach by contrast in explanations.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Infrastructure-as-Code
  (IaC) Policy Integration (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Policy Development >

  **Content Context (Complete Research Summary, per voter consensus):** Infrastructure as Code (IaC) manages infra via code
  (e.g., Terraform HCL, Ansible YAML) for automation/versioning. IaC Security shifts left to scan code pre-deployment. Policy
  as Code (PaC) embeds rules (OPA Rego, Sentinel) into workflows. Benefits: Prevent misconfigs, ensure compliance.


  **Standards (Completed):** NIST CSF (Protect: PR.AC-4 access, PR.IP-1 config mgmt); ISO 27001/27002 (A.12.6 vulnerability
  mgmt, A.14.2.5 secure dev via PaC); OWASP IaC Top 10 (secrets mgmt, compliance as code); CIS Benchmarks (AWS/Azure hardening);
  CSA CCM (CC6.1 policy enforcement).
