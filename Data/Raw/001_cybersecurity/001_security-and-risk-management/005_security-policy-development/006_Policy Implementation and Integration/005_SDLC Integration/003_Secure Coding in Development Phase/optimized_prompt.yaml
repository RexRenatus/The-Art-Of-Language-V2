active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the cost-effectiveness of shift-left security in the development phase
    versus traditional post-deployment remediation. Use real-world examples like the Equifax breach (caused by unpatched Apache
    Struts vulnerability due to insecure coding practices) to support arguments, and address common misconceptions such as
    'secure coding is only for QA testers.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    unsafe function as safe), 4) Unrelated concept (e.g., confuse SAST with DAST). Ensure plausible for mid-level learners.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Anki-compatible cards optimized
  for spaced repetition, Bloom''s Taxonomy progression, and active recall. Topic: Secure Coding in Development Phase (Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Policy Development > Policy Implementation and Integration > SDLC
  Integration > Secure Coding in Development Phase). Category: Cybersecurity.


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste the full learning_objectives array above]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [Paste the full scaffolding object above] – Ensure 7-8 cards per Layer 1-3, 6-7 for Layer 4.

  - Active Learning Tie-ins: Flashcards should prompt analysis/discussion (e.g., ''Why is this a misconception?''), code fixes
  (problem-solving), and standard comparisons (peer teaching).

  - Prior Knowledge: Assume basics in SDLC, programming, vulns (buffer overflow, injection).

  - Voter Consensus: High emphasis on OWASP/NIST/SEI CERT completeness, real examples (Equifax), misconceptions, checklists.


  Generate EXACTLY 30 flashcards following the flashcard_schema structure. Cover all Bloom''s levels proportionally (more
  lower for foundation). Use real code snippets (Python/Java/C safe examples). Vary difficulty. Ensure distractors per protocol.
  Output ONLY the cards in sequence, no intro/outro.'
