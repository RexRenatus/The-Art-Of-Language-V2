active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent should security requirements in the planning phase be customized to an organization's
    risk tolerance versus standardized across all projects? Use examples from NIST CSF 2.0 GOVERN function (e.g., GV.RM Risk
    Management Strategy) to support your position. Consider trade-offs in real-world scenarios like federal projects using
    NIST RMF.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    GV.OC with GV.RM; treating security as post-planning; ignoring SMART time-bound aspect). Distractors should be 70% semantically
    similar to correct answer, 20% opposites, 10% unrelated but framework-specific (e.g., from IDENTIFY function instead of

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy\
  \ (Bloom's Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate a comprehensive set of flashcards for the topic 'Security Requirements\
  \ in Planning Phase' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Policy Development > Policy\
  \ Implementation and Integration > SDLC Integration > Security Requirements in Planning Phase).\n\n**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**\
  \ Basic SDLC phases (planning), cybersecurity risks, risk assessment.\n\n**Learning Objectives:** [Insert the full learning_objectives\
  \ array here].\n\n**Active Learning Integration:** Weave in hooks from [discussion_prompt], [peer_teaching_activity], [problem_solving_exercise]\
  \ into explanations.\n\n**Scaffolding:** Distribute flashcards across [scaffolding_layers].\n\n**Sources (Complete Citations):**\
