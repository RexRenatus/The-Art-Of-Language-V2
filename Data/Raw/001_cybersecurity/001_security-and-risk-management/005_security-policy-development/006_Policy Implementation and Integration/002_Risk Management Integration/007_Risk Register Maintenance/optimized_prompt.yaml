active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2's emphasis on continuous monitoring, debate whether risk registers should
    be updated reactively (after incidents) or proactively (e.g., monthly reviews). Use real-world examples like ransomware
    attacks to support arguments. This sparks critical thinking on maintenance frequency and misconceptions about static vs.
    dynamic registers.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Full Research Context:** A risk register is a centralized repository for identified risks, analysis (likelihood/impact),
  status, owner, and responses (mitigate/avoid/transfer/accept). Maintenance ensures dynamism via continuous monitoring (NIST
  SP 800-37 Rev. 2). Key: Risk ID → Assessment → Response → Monitor/Update. CSRR focuses on cyber risks; integrates with ERM
  (NISTIR 8286/8286A: Identifying/Estimating Cybersecurity Risk for ERM). Best practices: Proactive reviews (monthly/quarterly),
  triggers (incidents, new vulns), ownership. Standards: NIST SP 800-30 (assessment), ISO 31000 (principles), COSO ERM. Sources:
  NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2, NISTIR 8286/8286A, ISO 31000:2018, COSO 2017 ERM Framework.
