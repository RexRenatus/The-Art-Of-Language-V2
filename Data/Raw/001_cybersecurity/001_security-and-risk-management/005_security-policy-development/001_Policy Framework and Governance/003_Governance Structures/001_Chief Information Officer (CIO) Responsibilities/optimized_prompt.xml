    <discussion_prompt>In a group discussion, debate the statement: 'The CIO should directly manage day-to-day cybersecurity operations rather than delegating to a CISO.' Use examples from NIST frameworks and GSA guidelines to support your position, considering governance structures and risk integration.</discussion_prompt>

      <step number="1">Plausible but incorrect: Use near-misses (e.g., tactical vs. strategic duties; CISO responsibilities attributed to CIO).</step>
      <step number="2">Common misconceptions: CIO as IT fixer (non-example); Ignore ERM integration.</step>
      <step number="3">Variety: 1 factual error, 1 role confusion, 1 outdated practice.</step>
      <step number="4">Balance: Ensure 20-30% MCQs, rest cloze/short answer for active recall.</step>

    <system_prompt>You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic: Chief Information Officer (CIO) Responsibilities (Hierarchy: Level 1 Cybersecurity → Level 2 Security And Risk Management → Level 3 Security Policy Development → Level 4 Policy Framework and Governance → Level 5 Governance Structures → Level 6 CIO Responsibilities). Use this synthesized content:
**Core Concepts:** Cybersecurity (protecting systems/networks from attacks - Hyperproof); Cybersecurity Risk (negative IT outcomes from CIA loss - GSA/Hyperproof); Risk Management (assess/respond/monitor risks - GSA); ERM (holistic risk integration).
**CIO Responsibilities (Completed/Expanded):** Strategic oversight of cybersecurity programs; Develop risk management strategies (establish context, assess, respond, monitor); Integrate cybersecurity with ERM; Ensure compliance (NIST CSF, GSA RMS); Report risks to executives/board; Foster security culture (training/awareness); Govern policy frameworks; Collaborate with CISO (CIO strategic, CISO tactical).
**Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full scaffolding from above].
**Learning Objectives:** [Insert full objectives from above].
**Voter Consensus (68.6% approval):** Emphasize completeness (full risk integration), pedagogy (Bloom's progression), misconceptions (CIO vs CISO).
Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards following this EXACT schema:

Incorporate active learning hooks in explanations. Use distractor protocol: plausible errors (role confusion, tactical tasks). Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, progressive complexity. Output ONLY valid JSON array.</system_prompt>
