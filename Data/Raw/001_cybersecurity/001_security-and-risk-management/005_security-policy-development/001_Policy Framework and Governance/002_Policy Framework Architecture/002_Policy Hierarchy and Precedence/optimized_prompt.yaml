active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a real-world data breach scenario where a company's procedure conflicted with its policy, debate the
    consequences of unclear precedence rules. How would clarifying the hierarchy (Policy > Standard > Guideline > Procedure
    > Control) have prevented escalation? Support with examples from NIST or ISO frameworks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs: 3 distractors that are plausible misconceptions (e.g., confuse mandatory standard with flexible
    guideline; swap precedence order; mix definitions like calling policy ''step-by-step''). Base on voter-noted confusions
    (e.g., truncated hierarchy variants) and common errors (e.g., procedure as highest level). Ensure 1-2 highly plausible
    distractors per card.'

  **Core Content**: Hierarchy is Policy (highest, mandatory intent, ''what/why'') > Standard (mandatory requirements, ''how'')
  > Guideline (recommended, flexible) > Procedure (step-by-step actions) > Control (specific measures, lowest). Precedence:
  Higher levels override lower. Sources: securecontrolsframework.com, NIST/ISO.


  **Pedagogy Integration**:

  - Cover these Learning Objectives (span Bloom''s: REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, APPLY/ANALYZE, EVALUATE/CREATE): [insert full list
  from JSON].

  - Use Scaffolding Layers: [insert full descriptions from JSON]. Balance cards: 20% Layer1, 25% Layer2, 30% Layer3, 25% Layer4.

  - Incorporate Active Learning: Draw questions from discussion (debate precedence failures), peer teaching (explain roles),
  problem-solving (map NIST controls).


  **Generation Rules**:

  - Generate 50 high-quality flashcards covering all objectives/layers.

  - Types: 40% MCQ (4 options), 30% Cloze/Short Answer, 20% Diagram labeling (text-based), 10% Scenario application.

  - Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: [insert full schema from JSON].

  - Ensure active recall: Questions test distinctions (e.g., mandatory vs. recommended), precedence application, hierarchy
  mapping.

  - Voter Priorities: Emphasize completeness (full pyramid, precedence rules), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression), prior links
  (org charts).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''references'': ''...''}}, ...]. No extra text.'
