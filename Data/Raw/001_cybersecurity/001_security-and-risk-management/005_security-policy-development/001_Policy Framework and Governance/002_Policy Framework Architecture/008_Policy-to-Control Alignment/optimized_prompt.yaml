active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the consequences of policy-to-control misalignment using real-world examples
    (e.g., the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident where policy gaps led to inadequate control implementation). How
    could NIST CSF 2.0 GOVERN function have prevented this? Support with evidence from frameworks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    1. Related but incorrect framework element (e.g., wrong CSF function like IDENTIFY instead of GOVERN), 1. Overly broad/narrow
    interpretation (e.g., control from wrong family). Ensure distractors teach by reinforcing correct concepts.'

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet using the exact schema:

  Front: Question (varied formats as specified).

  Back: Answer | Explanation | Reference | Bloom''s Level | Scaffolding Layer.


  Distribute: 10 flashcards per Bloom''s level, balanced across layers. Ensure progressive difficulty (Layer 1 foundation
  to Layer 4 integration). Use voter priorities: Complete NIST CSF 2.0 GOVERN best practices (e.g., ''Organizations should
  use GV.PO to establish policies, then align controls via GV.RM risk processes, mapping to SP 800-53 baselines for implementation
  and monitoring''). Include real-world examples, diagrams (text-based), and active learning ties. Output as JSON array of
  objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...''}].


  Best Practices: Questions test alignment traceability; explanations scaffold from definitions to creation; distractors per
  protocol.'
