active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Should cybersecurity enforcement prioritize deterrence (e.g., harsh penalties like GDPR's 4% global turnover
    fines) or rehabilitation (e.g., mandatory training)? Debate using real cases like Uber's 2016 breach cover-up ($148M settlement
    under various laws) or Equifax breach (HIPAA/CCPA implications). Address the misconception that enforcement always requires
    legal action rather than internal measures.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1 common misconception (e.g., ''Enforcement always means firing'' vs. due process),
      1 plausible but incomplete (e.g., NIST only, ignoring GDPR), 1 extreme/outdated (e.g., pre-GDPR fines).'
    - Ensure distractors are realistic from voter misconceptions or research (e.g., voluntary vs. mandatory confusion).
    - 'Vary question types: 40% MCQ, 30% cloze, 20% short answer, 10% scenario apply.'

  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST ABOVE]

  - Active learning: Use elements in explanations (e.g., reference discussion on deterrence).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers [INSERT FULL LAYERS ABOVE], tagging each.

  - Research: Focus on legal regs (GDPR Art83 fines, CCPA $7500/violation, HIPAA, CFAA, SOX, NIST CSF 2.0 Govern, full ISO/IEC
  27001 ISMS/Annex A compliance controls), employment laws (wrongful termination, due process), complete sources (nist.gov/cyberframework,
  iso.org/standard/27001, gdpr.eu, oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa).


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (12-13 per layer, balanced Bloom''s: 20% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 30%
  Evaluate, 20% Create). Follow exact schema:

  {FORMAT AS JSON ARRAY: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'':
  ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''d1'', ''d2'', ''d3'']}, ''tags'': [''...'']}, ...]}


  Ensure accuracy: Prioritize legal specifics over general cyber basics. Distractors per protocol. Promote active learning/scaffolding.'
