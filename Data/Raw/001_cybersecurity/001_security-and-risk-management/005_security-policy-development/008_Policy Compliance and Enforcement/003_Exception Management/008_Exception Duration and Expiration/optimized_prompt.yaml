  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the following: ''Should exceptions to security policies ever be granted
    without a strict expiration date? Provide arguments for and against, referencing NIST SP 800-53 controls like RA-3 and
    real-world examples from compliance auditing or incident response.'' Encourage participants to cite voter consensus on
    risk management and build on peer responses.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 3 distractors per question.

    - Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., ''Exceptions can be permanent'').

    - Distractor 2: Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Duration always 1 year'').

    - Distractor 3: Extreme/opposite (e.g., ''No expiration needed with controls'').

    Ensure distractors are plausible based on voter priorities (e.g., risk mgmt errors) and research context.'

  **Topic Hierarchy:** Cybersecurity (L1) → Security And Risk Management (L2) → Security Policy Development (L3) → Policy
  Compliance and Enforcement (L4) → Exception Management (L5) → Exception Duration and Expiration (L6).


  **Sources:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (RA-3 Risk Assessment, PM-9 Risk Management Strategy, control baselines); NIST SP 800-37
  Rev. 2 (RMF: Prepare-Categorize-Select-Implement-Assess-Monitor); NIST SP 800-39 (Managing Information Security Risk).


  **Research Context:** [Insert full provided research context here, including core concepts, standards, and voter-completed
  details on RMF exceptions]. Exceptions introduce risk; must have finite duration/expiration with compensating controls.


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste full learning_objectives array].

  - Scaffolding: [Paste full scaffolding including prior_knowledge, big_picture_context, layers].

  - Active Learning Tie-Ins: Reference discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving in explanations.


  **Task:** Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema below. Ensure progression through Bloom''s (scaffolding
  layers), voter consensus (measurable objectives, NIST focus), and distractor protocol. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards,
  e.g., [{type: ''...'', front: ''...'', back: {...}}]. No additional text.
