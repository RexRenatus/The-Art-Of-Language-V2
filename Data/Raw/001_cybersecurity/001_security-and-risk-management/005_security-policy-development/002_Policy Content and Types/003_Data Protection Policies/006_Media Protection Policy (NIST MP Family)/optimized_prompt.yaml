active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between different media sanitization methods (e.g., overwriting
    vs. physical destruction) in real-world scenarios like handling lost USB drives in a government office. Reference the
    2010 Pentagon USB incident and NIST SP 800-88 to support arguments on effectiveness and cost.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
