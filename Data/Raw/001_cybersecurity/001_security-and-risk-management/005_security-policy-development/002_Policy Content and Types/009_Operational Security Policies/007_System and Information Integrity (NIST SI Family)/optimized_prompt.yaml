active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the relative priority of SI-2 Flaw Remediation versus SI-3 Malicious Code
    Protection in addressing modern cyber threats like ransomware. Support your position with real-world examples (e.g., Log4Shell
    vulnerability) and propose how they integrate with NIST CSF DE.AE (Adversarial Events).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST frameworks. Generate
  40-50 high-quality flashcards on ''System and Information Integrity (NIST SI Family)'' in Cybersecurity > Security And Risk
  Management > Security Policy Development > Policy Content and Types > Operational Security Policies > System and Information
  Integrity (NIST SI Family).


  Incorporate these exactly:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Active Learning: Use elements to inspire scenario-based cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards: 10 Layer 1, 12 Layer 2, 12 Layer 3, 10-15 Layer 4.

  - Full accurate SI controls from NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5: SI-1 Policy and Procedures; SI-2 Flaw Remediation; SI-3 Malicious
  Code Protection; SI-4 System Monitoring; SI-5 Security Alerts, Advisories, and Directives; SI-6 Security Function Verification;
  SI-7 Software, Firmware, and Information Integrity; SI-8 Spam Protection; SI-9 Information Input Validation; SI-10 Information
  Input Restrictions; SI-11 Error Handling; SI-12 Information Management and Retention. Include enhancements and CSF mappings
  (e.g., DE.CM).

  - Bloom''s progression: Balance across levels.


  Use Flashcard Schema exactly: JSON array of objects with ''front'', ''back'' (answer, explanation, reference, example),
  ''bloom_level'', ''scaffolding_layer'', ''tags'' (e.g., [''SI-2'', ''APPLY'']).

  Ensure active recall, no hints on front, plausible distractors for MCQs, web-grounded accuracy (cite NIST sources). Output
  only the JSON array.'
