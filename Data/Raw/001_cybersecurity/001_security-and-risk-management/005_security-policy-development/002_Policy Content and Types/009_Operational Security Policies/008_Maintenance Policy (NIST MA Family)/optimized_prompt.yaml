  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''In a post-pandemic remote work era, MA-5 Maintenance
    Personnel requirements are more critical than ever due to nonlocal access risks (MA-4). Provide evidence from NIST SP
    800-53 Rev. 5 and real-world breaches like Equifax.'' Encourage participants to reference specific control enhancements.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5.
  Topic: Maintenance Policy (NIST MA Family). Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Policy Development
  > Policy Content and Types > Operational Security Policies > Maintenance Policy (NIST MA Family).


  CRITICAL ACCURACY: ONLY use Rev. 5 MA controls: MA-1 Policy and Procedures, MA-2 Controlled Maintenance, MA-3 Maintenance
  Tools, MA-4 Nonlocal Maintenance, MA-5 Maintenance Personnel, MA-6 Timely Maintenance Intervention. Exclude MA-7+ (e.g.,
  no vulnerability scanning=RA-5, no removable media=MP).
