active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between agent-based and agentless NAC solutions in a hybrid
    work environment with BYOD and IoT devices. Consider factors like deployment ease, accuracy of posture assessment, and
    scalability. Support arguments with examples from healthcare or enterprise settings.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Content Context (Complete and Comprehensive, per voter consensus 87.1% approval):** NAC enforces security policies for
  network access, authenticating users/devices, assessing posture (AV, patches, encryption), and granting/denying access.
  Core concepts: endpoint, security posture, policy enforcement, authentication, authorization. Key functionalities: profiling/visibility,
  authentication/authorization, policy enforcement, quarantine/remediation. Types: Agent-based (endpoint agent for deep checks),
  Agentless (network profiling, ideal for IoT/BYOD), Hybrid (both). Implementation: Deploy via appliances/software, configure
  policies (802.1X/RADIUS), monitor/remediate. Integration: SIEM, Zero Trust, compliance (NIST SP 800-53). Case study: Hospital
  uses agentless NAC for IoT to block ransomware. Sources: NIST SP 800-53 (AC-2), Cisco ISE Documentation, SANS Institute
  NAC Guide.
