active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between implementing strict CCC processes (e.g., full SIA and approvals) and agile/DevOps
    practices in a cloud-native environment. Consider real-world impacts from incidents like the SolarWinds supply chain attack.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 1 based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse CI with full system).

    - 1 from related but incorrect terms (e.g., ''Patch Management'' instead of CCC).

    - 1 extreme/edge case (e.g., ''No approval needed for emergencies''—partial truth but misses documentation).

    Ensure distractors are realistic to challenge understanding.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST frameworks. Use the
  following to create optimized Anki-style flashcards for the topic ''Configuration Change Control (NIST CM Family)''.


  **Topic Hierarchy:** Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Policy Development > Policy Content and Types
  > Configuration and Vulnerability Management Policies > Configuration Change Control (NIST CM Family).


  **Voter Consensus:** 100% approval. Incorporate all priority suggestions: Bloom''s objectives, 4-layer scaffolding, active
  learning, concept map, NIST SP 800-128 completion, ITIL/CIS, case studies (SolarWinds, Equifax), sources.


  **Research Context (Completed):** Configuration Change Control (CCC) per NIST SP 800-53 CM family manages changes to maintain
  security/integrity. Key: SecCM (SP 800-128: propose/assess/approve/implement/verify changes via SIA). Industry: ITIL Change
