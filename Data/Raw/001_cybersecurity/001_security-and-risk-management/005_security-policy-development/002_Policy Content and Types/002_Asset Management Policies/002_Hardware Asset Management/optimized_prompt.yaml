active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the role of unmanaged IoT devices (e.g., rogue smart cameras) in expanding
    an organization's attack surface. Propose how HWAM processes, informed by NIST SP 800-161 and CIS Controls, can mitigate
    these risks while considering trade-offs with usability.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: '3 distractors per MCQ based on voter-suggested misconceptions: 1) Confuse unmanaged vs. authorized
    devices; 2) Overlook lifecycle stages (e.g., ignore disposal); 3) Misapply standards (e.g., cite wrong NIST doc); 4) Ignore
    tools/integration (e.g., no NAC mention); 5) Downplay attack surface/CDM links. Ensure plausible, derived from real-world
    errors like shadow IT oversight.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using Bloom''s Taxonomy, active
  learning, and scaffolding for optimal retention. Generate high-quality flashcards for ''Hardware Asset Management (HWAM)''
  in Cybersecurity (Hierarchy: Level1 Cybersecurity > L2 Security And Risk Management > L3 Security Policy Development > L4
  Policy Content and Types > L5 Asset Management Policies > L6 Hardware Asset Management). Consensus-approved content (100%
  voter approval) integrates NIST SP 800-161 Rev1, NISTIR 8011, CIS Control 2, ISO 27001 A.8, lifecycle mgmt, unmanaged/unauthorized
  devices, attack surface reduction, CDM/Zero Trust.


  Learning Objectives: [insert full list above].

  Active Learning: Use scenarios from [discussion/peer/problem-solving] for applied cards.

  Scaffolding Content: Strictly base cards on these 4 layers [insert full scaffolding array above]; cover prior knowledge/concept
  map.


  Output 40 flashcards in JSON array using exact schema: [insert full flashcard_schema.structure]. Follow distractor protocol
  precisely. Ensure cards progress cognitively (Layer1=Remember/Understand heavy; Layer4=Evaluate/Create). Vary formats for
  engagement. No external content; ground in provided research/voter inputs.'
