  discussion_prompt: 'You are a compliance officer for a tech company outsourcing data analytics to a third-party vendor.
    Debate with your peers: Is a DPA always required, even for non-EU data? What key clauses are non-negotiable under GDPR
    vs. CCPA, and why? Use real-world examples like cloud services (e.g., AWS) or payroll providers to support your arguments.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    data'' vs. ''required for any personal data processing''). 2. Role reversals (e.g., confuse controller/processor duties).
    3. Partial truths (e.g., ''breach notification in 72 hours'' but omit ''without undue delay'' for GDPR). 4. Regulatory
    mixes (e.g., CCPA clause as GDPR distractor). Ensure distractors are realistic from voter-noted confusions.'

  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards (10 per major Bloom''s level: REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, APPLY/ANALYZE, EVALUATE/CREATE) covering
  all scaffolding layers (Layer 1 Foundation, Layer 2 Components, etc.), learning objectives, and active learning elements.
  Use this comprehensive content:


  [Insert full content here: Core Concepts (definitions from research), Purpose, When Required (third-party scenarios), Key
  Elements (full list: subject matter, controller/processor obligations, sub-processors, data rights, breach notification,
  audits, return/deletion, liability, governing law), Implementation Steps, Integration (GDPR Art. 28, CCPA, vendor RM, cross-border).
  Sources: GDPR Article 28, ICO DPA Guide, CCPA §1798.100.]


  Incorporate voter consensus: Emphasize completeness (all standard clauses), misconceptions (DPA not GDPR-only), real examples
  (AWS, MOVEit).


  Output ONLY in JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"type": "Q&A|MCQ|Cloze", "front": "...", "back": "...", "blooms_level":
  "REMEMBER", "scaffolding_layer": "Layer 1", "explanation": "...", "active_tie_in": "..."}.


  Follow flashcard schema exactly: Varied types, distractors per protocol, explanations with sources/objectives. Ensure university
  pedagogy: Scaffolded progression, active recall, spaced repetition friendly (concise, testable).'
