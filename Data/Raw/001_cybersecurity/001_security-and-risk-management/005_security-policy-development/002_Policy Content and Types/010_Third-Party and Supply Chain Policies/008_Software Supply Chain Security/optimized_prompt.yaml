  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Open-Source Software (OSS) is inherently safer than proprietary
    software due to its transparency.'' Use examples like Log4Shell and XZ Utils to support arguments, and propose balanced
    mitigation strategies incorporating SBOM and SLSA.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
