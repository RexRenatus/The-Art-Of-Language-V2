active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a mid-sized company experiencing frequent insider threats, should security training be fully role-based
    or hybrid with general awareness? Debate using NIST SP 1288 findings on challenges like role assignment and effectiveness
    measurement. Consider pros/cons for physical/personnel policies and real-world trade-offs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
