  discussion_prompt: In a Zero Trust Architecture, how does the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) differ from traditional firewalls
    in handling access requests? Debate the trade-offs in terms of performance, security granularity, and implementation complexity,
    using NIST SP 800-207 as reference. Address misconceptions like equating PEPs solely to firewalls.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Semantic confusion (e.g., PDP role for PEP), 2) Common misconception
    (e.g., PEP=firewall only), 3) Partial truth (e.g., ignores context/PIP). Ensure plausible for cybersecurity learners;
    reference voter-noted errors.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Policy Enforcement Point
  (PEP) Implementation (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Policy Development > Policy
  Content and Types > Access Control Policies > PEP Implementation). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning
  components, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema to generate high-quality, pedagogically optimized flashcards.


  Context: PEP enforces PDP decisions (using PIP data) in ZTA (NIST SP 800-207). PEP != firewall (more granular). NIST SP
  800-53: SC-7/SC-18 enforcement. SP 1800-35: Implementation steps. Sources: NIST SP 800-207, 800-53 Rev5, 1800-35, 800-162
  (SDP). Prerequisite: Access Control Policies.


  Incorporate: Bloom''s progression, voter consensus (completeness, pedagogy), scaffolding content, active learning hints,
  formative assessments (MCQs with distractors/explanations).


  Generate exactly 25 flashcards following the schema. Distribute by Bloom''s/scaffolding as specified. Output ONLY a JSON
  array of flashcard objects. Ensure explanations reference NIST, address misconceptions, link to prior knowledge.'
