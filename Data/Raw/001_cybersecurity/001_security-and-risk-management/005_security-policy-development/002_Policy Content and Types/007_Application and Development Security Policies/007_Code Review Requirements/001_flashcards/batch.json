        "core_logic": "The primary risk of skipping code reviews is the increased likelihood of security vulnerabilities and bugs being present in deployed software, because these issues are often caught early by peer review, since finding them later in penetration testing or production is significantly more expensive and damaging. This functions by highlighting the cost-effectiveness of early detection, connecting review practices to lifecycle cost.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The correct answer focuses on the most significant consequence: finding issues late in the lifecycle, which is costly and risky. The distractors mention related but less direct risks like reduced collaboration or slower cycles, or focus on a consequence (higher costs) rather than the immediate risk of discovery in expensive phases.",
        "analogy": "Not conducting code reviews is like not proofreading a legal document before filing it; you risk discovering critical errors only when it's too late and costly to fix."
