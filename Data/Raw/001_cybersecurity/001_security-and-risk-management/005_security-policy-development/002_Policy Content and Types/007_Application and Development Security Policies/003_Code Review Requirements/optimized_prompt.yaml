active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between manual peer code reviews and automated tools (e.g.,
    SAST vs. human review). How do they complement each other in addressing OWASP Top 10 risks? Provide real-world examples
    from breaches like Log4Shell and justify your position using NIST SSDF guidelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Context and Content (Synthesized from OWASP, NIST, Voter Consensus):** Code review is a peer examination of code to detect
  vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10: A01 Broken Access Control, A03 Injection, etc.), ensure standards, and manage risks in SDLC.
  Requirements: ≥2 peer reviews for prod code, mandatory SAST (e.g., SonarQube)/DAST (OWASP ZAP), checklists, remediation
  SLAs (critical:24h), audit trails, CI/CD gates. OWASP Code Review Guide: Manual/automated practices, structured checklists
  per Top 10, SDLC integration (https://owasp.org/www-project-code-review-guide/). NIST SSDF SP 800-218: PO.7 Review code
  (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/218/final). NIST CSF 2.0: Govern risks (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework). Other:
  CWE Top 25 (https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/).
