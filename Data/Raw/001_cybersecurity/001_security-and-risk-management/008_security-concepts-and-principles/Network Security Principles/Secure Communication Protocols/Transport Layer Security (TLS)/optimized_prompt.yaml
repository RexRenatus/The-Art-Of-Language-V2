  discussion_prompt: In a debate format, argue whether TLS 1.3's removal of certain legacy features (per RFC 8446 and RFC
    9325) enhances or hinders security in environments with legacy systems. Support your position with evidence on trade-offs
    like forward secrecy vs. compatibility.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Use the following to generate high-quality, optimized flashcards:


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the ''learning_objectives'' array here verbatim].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Weave in concepts from discussion (TLS 1.3 trade-offs, RFC 8446/9325), peer teaching (handshake
  steps), and problem-solving (Wireshark analysis, PFS ciphers) as hooks in explanations.


  **Scaffolding:** Structure flashcards progressively: [Insert the ''scaffolding'' array here verbatim]. Start with Layer
  1 basics, build to Layer 4 integration. Link to prior knowledge (OSI layers, encryption types).


  **Big Picture:** TLS ensures CIA triad in networks, prevents MITM, critical for e-commerce.


  **Sources:** RFC 5246 (TLS 1.2), RFC 8446 (TLS 1.3), RFC 9325 (best practices), Wireshark docs.


  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly follow [Insert the ''flashcard_schema'' object here verbatim]. Output 50 flashcards in JSON
  array format: [{''type'': ''MCQ'', ''question'': ''...'', ''options'': [''A. ...'', ''B. ...'', ''C. ...'', ''D. ...''],
  ''correct_answer'': ''B'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': 2, ''references'':
  ''...''}]. Ensure university pedagogy: Bloom''s progression, active recall, spaced repetition friendly.


  Generate flashcards now, covering all objectives and layers comprehensively.'
