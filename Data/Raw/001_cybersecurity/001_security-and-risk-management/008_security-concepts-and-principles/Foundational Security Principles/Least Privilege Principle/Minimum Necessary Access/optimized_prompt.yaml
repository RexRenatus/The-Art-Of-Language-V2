    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, analyze how violations of minimum necessary access contributed to real-world breaches
    like SolarWinds (excessive supply chain privileges allowing lateral movement) or Colonial Pipeline (ransomware exploiting
    over-privileged accounts). What preventive measures using zero trust could have mitigated these? Debate the trade-offs
    with productivity.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., ''Same as zero access''); 3) Real breaches (e.g., ''SolarWinds succeeded due to air-gapping''); 4) Partial accuracy
    (e.g., ''Reduces attack surface but increases costs only''). Ensure distractors teach by debunking in explanations. Balance:
    40% basic recall, 30% application, 20% analysis, 10% eval/create.'

  INTEGRATE:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the 6 objectives above].

  - Scaffolding: Use the exact 4 layers provided, progressing from foundation to integration.

  - Active Learning: Draw from discussion/peer/problem-solving for scenario cards.

  - Prior Knowledge: Builds on Least Privilege.

  - Examples: DB admin (tables only), HIPAA nurse (patient records), SolarWinds/Colonial breaches.

  - Misconceptions: [list the 5].
