active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between comprehensive DLP monitoring (which raises privacy concerns) and minimal
    monitoring (which increases security risks) in a hybrid work environment. Use recent data breach examples like SolarWinds
    or MOVEit to support arguments, and propose balanced strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    data at rest'' instead of all states; ''DLP is antivirus''), (2) Partial truths (e.g., ''Data in motion is only email''
    omitting file transfers), (3) Confusable terms (e.g., Symantec DLP vs. unrelated tools like firewalls), (4) Real-world
    edge cases (e.g., traditional vs. modern DLP limits). Ensure one correct, others 20-30% plausible to trained eye.'

  Use this comprehensive content to generate 25 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet:


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s Taxonomy progression):** [Insert the full ''learning_objectives'' array here]. Ensure ~4
  cards per objective, balanced across levels.


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the full ''scaffolding'' array here]. Distribute cards: 30% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer
  3, 20% Layer 4.


  **Active Learning Integration:** Weave in elements like discussion trade-offs (privacy vs. security), peer teaching on data
  states/misconceptions, problem-solving scenarios for higher-level cards.


  **Core Content from Research:** DLP prevents sensitive data loss (PII/PHI/trade secrets) across states (at rest/in motion/in
  use); classification key; exfiltration prevention; tools (Symantec DLP, Microsoft Purview); traditional vs. modern (cloud/hybrid
  challenges); misconceptions (not antivirus, complements encryption); NIST SP 800-53; breaches (SolarWinds, MOVEit).


  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly output a JSON array of 25 flashcards matching this exact format:

  [{"id":1,"question":"...","type":"mcq","options":["A. Correct","B. Distractor1","C. Distractor2","D. Distractor3"],"correct_answer":"A","bloom_level":"Remember","scaffolding_layer":1,"explanation":"..."},
  ...]

  Follow the precise ''flashcard_schema'' rules for structure, distractors (plausible via misconceptions/partial truths),
  and explanations (correct + debunk + links).


  Prioritize active recall, spaced repetition best practices: Varied question types, progressive difficulty, no hints in questions.
  Ensure university-level accuracy, no fluff.'
