active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between automated vulnerability scanning (e.g., Nessus)
    and manual assessments in an enterprise setting. Consider factors like accuracy, coverage, false positives, and cost.
    Provide evidence from NIST SP 800-30 or real-world breaches (e.g., Equifax).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    truth (e.g., correct for different context); 3) Plausible unrelated term (e.g., ''penetration test'' vs ''vulnerability
    scan''). Ensure distractors teach by contrast. Base on real sources (NIST, CVSS errors).'

  **Completed Research Context (NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 full details):** Vulnerability Assessment identifies weaknesses per:
  1. Prepare (define scope, team, methods); 2. Conduct (ID vulnerabilities via scanning/tools, analyze likelihood/impact);
  3. Communicate (reports with prioritized risks); 4. Maintain (update post-changes). Integrates with NIST CSF Identify function.
  Tools: Nessus, OpenVAS, Nmap. Scoring: CVSS (exploitability + impact). Standards: OWASP Top 10, CIS Control 7. Sources:
  NIST SP 800-30r1 (nvlpubs.nist.gov), CVSS v4 (nvd.nist.gov), OWASP.org, CISecurity.org.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list from above].

  **Active Learning Context:** Use for scenario cards [insert summaries].

  **Scaffolding Layers:** Strictly base cards on these 4 layers [insert full layers]. Prerequisites: Basic networking.


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards following the exact schema [insert schema details]. Ensure progressive complexity (Layer
  1 simple recall → Layer 4 synthesis). Balance Bloom''s levels/objectives. Explanations reference sources/voters (e.g., NIST
  steps). Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, e.g., [{''type'':''mcq'', ''front'':..., ''back'':{...}}]. No extra text.'
