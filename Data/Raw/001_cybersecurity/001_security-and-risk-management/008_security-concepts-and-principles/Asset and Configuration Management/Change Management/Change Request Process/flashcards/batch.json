This functions by enforcing granular access controls on who can submit, approve, or implement changes, preventing misuse and maintaining the integrity of the change process and the systems it manages.",

This functions by analyzing the actual outcomes against the planned objectives, identifying any deviations or unexpected impacts, and documenting lessons learned to refine future change requests and implementations, thereby enhancing overall risk management.",
