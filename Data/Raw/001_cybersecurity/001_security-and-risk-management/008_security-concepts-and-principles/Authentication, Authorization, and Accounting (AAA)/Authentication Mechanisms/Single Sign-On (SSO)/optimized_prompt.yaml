active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a think-pair-share activity, discuss the pros and cons of SSO as a single point of failure versus
    its convenience. Share real-world examples like the Okta breach (2022 supply chain attack) and how it impacted federated
    access. Pairs then share with the class, evaluating trade-offs using a pros/cons matrix.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema provided. Incorporate these pedagogical elements:


  **Learning Objectives** (span all Bloom''s levels; tag each card):

  [Insert full learning_objectives array here]


  **Active Learning Integration**: Draw from discussion (pros/cons, Okta), peer-teaching (components), problem-solving (migration
  risks/mitigations) for scenario-based cards.


  **Scaffolding** (balance 12-13 cards per layer; tag each):

  **Prior Knowledge**: Link to basic auth/MFA.

  [Insert full scaffolding object here]


  **Flashcard Schema** (MANDATORY exact format):

  [Insert full flashcard_schema here]


  **Content Sources**: Use provided research (SSO def, IdP/SP, tokens, OAuth 2.0, SAML 2.0 full details: XML assertions for
  web SSO/federation; complete OAuth flows; OIDC/JWT; risks like Okta breach; best practices: MFA, Zero Trust). Ensure completeness:
  SAML 2.0 (SP-initiated/IdP-initiated flows, signed assertions); OAuth (auth code + PKCE); misconceptions (SSO not full auth
  bypass).


  **Best Practices**: Active recall (no cues in questions); spaced repetition friendly (varied formats); distractors per protocol;
  explanations scaffold to higher layers. Output ONLY a JSON array: [{''layer'':1, ''bloom'':''Remember'', ''front'':...,
  ''back'':{...}}, ...]. Group by layer in array.'
