active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between biometric authentication and traditional password-based methods in terms
    of security, usability, privacy, and cost. Which is better for high-security environments like airports, and why? Support
    arguments with NIST SP 800-63A guidelines and real-world examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on\
  \ 'Biometric Authentication' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Concepts and Principles\
  \ > AAA > Authentication Mechanisms > Biometric Authentication).\n\nIncorporate these elements:\n- Learning Objectives:\
  \ [paste full array from above]\n- Active Learning: Use prompts/activities to inspire higher-order cards (e.g., evaluation\
  \ scenarios).\n- Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers + prior knowledge.\n- Research Context: Use the full summary\
  \ provided, including completed NIST SP 800-63A details (IAL3 biometrics with PAD, template protections), best practices\
  \ (revocability, multi-modal), and sources.\n\nOutput ONLY in JSON array of flashcards, each matching this schema:\n{\n\
