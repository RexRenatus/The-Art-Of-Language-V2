  discussion_prompt: 'Debate RADIUS vs. Diameter: When would you choose one over the other in a modern enterprise network?
    Consider scalability, security (e.g., RADIUS UDP vs. Diameter TCP/SCTP), and migration costs. Tie into zero-trust architectures.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1 superficially similar (e.g., confuse ports 1812/1813), 1 common misconception (e.g.,
      RADIUS uses TCP like TACACS+), 1 edge case (e.g., legacy port 1645).'
    - Ensure plausibility from research context/vulnerabilities.
    - Avoid obvious wrongs; promote critical thinking.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert educational flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity topics, using university-level
  pedagogy (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for the topic:
  RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service), Category: Cybersecurity, Domain: Security And Risk Management, Subdomain:
  Security Concepts and Principles, Entry: AAA, Entry Subdomain: Authentication Protocols. Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > Security And Risk Management > Security Concepts and Principles > AAA > Authentication Protocols > RADIUS.


  Big Picture: RADIUS provides centralized AAA for scalable network access control, foundational for zero-trust, enterprises,
  WiFi/VPN.
