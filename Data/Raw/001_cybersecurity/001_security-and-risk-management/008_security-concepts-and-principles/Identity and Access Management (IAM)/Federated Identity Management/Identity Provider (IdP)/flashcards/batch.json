        "core_logic": "The assertion identifier serves as a unique token for each assertion, preventing replay attacks. This works by the IdP generating a unique value for each assertion, which the RP checks to ensure it hasn't seen that specific assertion before, thereby mitigating the risk of an attacker reusing a captured assertion.",
