        "core_logic": "Mantraps are designed with interlocking doors that function sequentially, allowing only one person to enter or exit at a time. This mechanism is crucial because it physically prevents unauthorized individuals from following authorized personnel, thereby mitigating tailgating and piggybacking risks.",

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "AALs define the required strength of an authenticator to verify a subscriber's identity. Higher AALs provide greater confidence because they are based on more robust authentication methods, ensuring that the system can reliably establish the claimant's identity.",

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Managing access rights effectively is a persistent challenge because organizations evolve, roles change, and permissions must be updated promptly. Failure to do so, as LockManage notes, can lead to security vulnerabilities, since users might retain access they no longer need.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors propose issues that are either the opposite of common problems (overly simple UI, excessive redundancy) or a related but distinct challenge (cybersecurity integration), rather than the core operational difficulty of managing access permissions.",
        "analogy": "Managing access rights in a PACS is like managing keys to a large building; you need to ensure the right people have the right keys to the right doors, and collect them back when they leave or change roles."
