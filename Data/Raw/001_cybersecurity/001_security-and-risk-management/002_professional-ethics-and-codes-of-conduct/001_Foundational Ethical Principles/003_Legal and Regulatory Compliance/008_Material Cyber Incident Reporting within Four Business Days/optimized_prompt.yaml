active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the materiality of the SolarWinds supply chain attack or Colonial Pipeline
    ransomware incident. Argue whether it met SEC reporting thresholds, considering quantitative costs, qualitative reputational
    impacts, and potential delays for national security. Reference the 'total mix' of information standard and vote on reporting
    compliance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full array from above]

  - Active Learning: Use concepts from discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving for scenario flashcards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers: [insert full scaffolding details].


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using this schema: [insert full flashcard_schema].

  Ensure web-grounded accuracy: SEC Rule 8-K Item 1.05 (4 business days post-materiality determination); definitions from
  SEC; delays for national security; cases like SolarWinds/Colonial.

  Prioritize Bloom''s progression, measurable verbs, and distractors from misconceptions. Output as numbered JSON array: [{''front'':
  ''...'', ''back'': {''correct_answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''metadata'': {...}}}].

  Voter Consensus: 82.9% approval; emphasize completeness, concept map integration, prior knowledge (CIA, 8-K, accounting
  materiality).'
