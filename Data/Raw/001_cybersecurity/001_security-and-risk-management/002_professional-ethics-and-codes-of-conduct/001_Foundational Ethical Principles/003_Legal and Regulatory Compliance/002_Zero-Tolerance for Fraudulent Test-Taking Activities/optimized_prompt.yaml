active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the merits of zero-tolerance policies versus contextual judgment in handling test fraud. Consider
    impacts on test integrity, fairness, and student morale using real-world examples like online exam cheating scandals during
    COVID-19 (e.g., Proctorio controversies or university honor code breaches).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs: 1 based on common misconception (e.g., ''leniency for minor infractions''),
      1 partial truth (e.g., ''only applies to digital tests''), 1 unrelated concept (e.g., ''focuses solely on data encryption'').'
    - Ensure distractors are realistic from voter suggestions or research (e.g., 'contextual judgment over zero-tolerance').
    - Avoid obvious wrongs; make them test deeper understanding.
    variety: 50% MCQ with distractors, 30% cloze, 20% open-ended for higher Bloom's.
