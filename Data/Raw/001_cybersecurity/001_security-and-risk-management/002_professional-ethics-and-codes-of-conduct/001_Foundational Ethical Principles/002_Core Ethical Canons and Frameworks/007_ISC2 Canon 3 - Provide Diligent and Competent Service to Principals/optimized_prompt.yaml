    errors like confusing diligence with overwork.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity ethics education. Generate high-quality, optimized
  flashcards for the topic: **ISC2 Canon 3: Provide Diligent and Competent Service to Principals** (Category: Cybersecurity;

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - **Learning Objectives** (span Bloom''s Taxonomy): [Insert full learning_objectives array here].

  - **Active Learning** (inspire scenario-based cards): [Insert full active_learning object here].

  - **Scaffolding Layers** (distribute flashcards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4): [Insert full scaffolding
  object here].

  - **Best Practices** (from research/voters): Complete guidelines including continuous CPE, know limits (disclose/seek help/decline),
  documentation, risk communication, confidentiality.


  **Flashcard Generation Rules**:

  - Output exactly 50 flashcards as a JSON array of objects.

  - Cover all objectives, layers, and active learning scenarios.

  - Use schema: [{''id'':1, ''type'':''mcq|cloze|short_answer'', ''bloom_level'':''Remember|etc.'', ''scaffolding_layer'':''1|2|3|4'',
  ''front'':''...'', ''back'':''...'', ''tags'':[''ISC2'',''Canon3'',''ethics'']}, ...]

  - Follow flashcard_schema strictly: MCQ (60%), Cloze (20%), Short-answer (20%). Distractors per protocol.

  - Ensure university-level rigor: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, no hints on front.

  - Research-grounded: Principals=employers/clients; Diligent=care/thorough/prompt; Competent=within expertise. Source: ISC2
