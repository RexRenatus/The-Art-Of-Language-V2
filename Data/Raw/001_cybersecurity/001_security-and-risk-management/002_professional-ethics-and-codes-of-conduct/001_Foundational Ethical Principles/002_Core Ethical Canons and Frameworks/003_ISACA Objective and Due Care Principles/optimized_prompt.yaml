  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Bloom''s Objectives: [Insert full learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: [Insert summaries of active_learning_components here]

  - Scaffolding: Strictly progress from Layer 1 (definitions) to Layer 4 (integration), with ~6 cards per layer.


  Use EXACTLY this Flashcard Schema: [Insert full flashcard_generation_schema here]. Ensure flashcards test progression through
  Bloom''s (e.g., MCQs for REMEMBER/APPLY, open for CREATE). Reference research: Due Care (reasonable safeguards), Objectivity
  (impartiality), COBIT (governance), Risk IT (risk domains), ISACA Code Principles 3-4, Equifax example.
