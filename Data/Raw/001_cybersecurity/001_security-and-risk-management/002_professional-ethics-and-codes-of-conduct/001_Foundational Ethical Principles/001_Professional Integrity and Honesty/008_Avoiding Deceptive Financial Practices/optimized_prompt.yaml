active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a cybersecurity team, you discover a colleague has exaggerated their qualifications to secure a third-party
    vendor contract, potentially introducing risks. Is this a deceptive financial practice? Should you report it? Debate the
    ethical implications using NIST CSF governance principles, Interagency Guidance on Third-Party Risk Management, and professional
    codes of conduct, considering gray areas in ethics and prior knowledge of basic honesty principles.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs, create 3 plausible distractors:

    - Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., confuse fraud with accidental error).

    - Distractor 2: Related but incorrect term (e.g., ''operational risk'' vs. ''third-party risk'').

    - Distractor 3: Extreme or partial truth (e.g., over/under-state framework role).

    Ensure distractors are realistic, drawn from research context or examples (e.g., phishing vs. ransomware specifics).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Avoiding Deceptive Financial
  Practices'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Professional Ethics and Codes of Conduct >
  Foundational Ethical Principles > Professional Integrity and Honesty > Avoiding Deceptive Financial Practices).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Active Learning: [insert summaries of discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving].

  - Scaffolding: Generate 20-30 flashcards distributed across 4 layers [insert full scaffolding content]. Use 5-8 per layer,
  progressing Bloom''s levels (Layer 1: Remember/Understand; Layer 2: Understand/Apply; Layer 3: Apply/Analyze; Layer 4: Analyze/Evaluate/Create).

  - Real-world examples: Phishing scams, ransomware payments, insider fraud, vendor exaggeration.

  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly [insert full schema above].


  Generate diverse cards: 60% MCQ (lower levels), 40% short-answer (higher). Ensure prior knowledge links (e.g., basic ethics/phishing).
  Output ONLY a valid JSON array of flashcard objects, e.g., [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''type'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'':
  ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': 1, ''explanation'': ''...''}]. No additional text.'
