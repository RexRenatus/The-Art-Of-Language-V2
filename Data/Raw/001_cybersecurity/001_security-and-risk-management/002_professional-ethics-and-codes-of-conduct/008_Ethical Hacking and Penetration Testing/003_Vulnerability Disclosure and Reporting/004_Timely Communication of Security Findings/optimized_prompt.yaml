active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the ethics of immediate public disclosure versus coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) in
    a high-impact scenario like a zero-day exploit in critical infrastructure (e.g., Log4Shell). In small groups, argue pro/con
    positions considering timelines (e.g., 45-90 days), stakeholder impacts (vendors, users, researchers), legal obligations,
    and risk mitigation. Follow with a class-wide debate and vote on the optimal approach.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    vs CVD), 1 related but incorrect term (e.g., ''patch'' vs ''mitigation''), 1 edge case (e.g., ''90 days'' vs ''45 days'').
    Ensure distractors are realistic based on research context to promote active recall and error correction.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Timely Communication
  of Security Findings'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Professional Ethics and Codes of
  Conduct > Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing > Vulnerability Disclosure and Reporting > Timely Communication of Security
  Findings).


  **Completed Research Context:** Effective timely communication minimizes exploitation windows. Core concepts: Security Vulnerability
  (flaw enabling control defeat); Vulnerability Disclosure (reporting/managing info); CVD (structured: gather info from finders,
  coordinate stakeholders, disclose mitigations/publicly); Timely Communication (prompt info to right people); Mitigation
  (patches/workarounds). Standards: CERT/CC (Intake: secure report; Triage: severity; Coordination: vendor fix ~45 days; Disclosure:
  advisory). CISA VDP: Report vulnerabilities at cisa.gov/report; 24-72hr ack, coordinates federal, KEV catalog for exploited
  vulns (mandatory disclosure). Others: ISO 29147, FIRST CVD. Examples: Log4Shell (rapid coordination). Sources: CERT/CC (kb.cert.org/vuls),
  CISA VDP (cisa.gov/vdp), NIST SP 800-61.


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Use these Learning Objectives [insert array above]. Scaffolding: Layer 1 Foundation [insert],
  Layer 2 Components [insert], etc. Active Learning: Inspire questions from activities [insert summaries]. Big Picture: Ethical
  risk mitigation in prof practice. Concept Map: [insert textual from scaffolding].


  **Generate 40 flashcards following Flashcard Schema [insert full schema]:**

  - Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'':
  ''...''}]

  - Ensure university-level rigor: progressive Bloom''s, active recall, distractors as specified.

  - Cover all layers/objectives evenly. No duplicates.'
