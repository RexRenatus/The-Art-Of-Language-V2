active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between intrusive (e.g., exploitation) and non-intrusive
    (e.g., passive scanning) testing techniques. How do these choices impact collateral damage risk, client trust, and ethical
    compliance? Use real-world examples like accidental DoS during pentests to support your arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per card: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''ROE is optional''), 2) Partial truth
    (e.g., correct component but wrong context), 3) Extreme/opposite (e.g., ''Test only in production''). Ensure distractors
    are realistic, derived from voter priorities like incomplete ROE or ignored phases.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Ethical Hacking and Penetration\
  \ Testing. Topic: 'Prevention of Collateral Damage During Testing' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management\
  \ > Professional Ethics and Codes of Conduct > Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing > Ethical Testing Boundaries and\
  \ Limitations > Prevention of Collateral Damage During Testing). Consensus: 100% approval from voters emphasizing completeness\
  \ (full ROE/NIST details, sources), Bloom's objectives, 4-layer scaffolding, prior knowledge links, big picture context.\n\
  \nSources: NIST SP 800-115 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-115.pdf) - Phased methodology\
  \ (Planning/ROE, Discovery, Attack, Reporting); CREST Defensible Penetration Testing; OSSTMM; PTES guidelines.\n\nIncorporate\
  \ these pedagogical elements:\n- Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]\n- Active Learning: [insert summaries of\
  \ discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving]\n- Scaffolding: Use 4 layers [insert full descriptions above] for progressive\
  \ coverage.\n\nGenerate 50 high-quality flashcards (mix: 20% remember/understand, 30% apply/analyze, 30% evaluate, 20% create).\
  \ Balance across layers (Layer 1: 15 cards, Layer 2: 15, Layer 3: 10, Layer 4: 10).\n\nOutput Format (JSON array of objects):\n\
