        "core_logic": "Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is vital because it provides context about attacker behavior (TTPs) and indicators of compromise, which can corroborate the evidence found on compromised systems, thus strengthening the prima facie case. It functions by aggregating and analyzing threat data, which is a prerequisite for understanding the nature and origin of a cyber attack.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors misrepresent CTI as a recovery tool, a legal resource, or solely a pre-incident vulnerability identification mechanism, failing to recognize its post-incident analytical role in corroborating evidence.",
        "analogy": "CTI is like a detective's dossier on known criminals; it helps identify the 'modus operandi' of the attacker and link specific actions to known threat groups, strengthening the case."
