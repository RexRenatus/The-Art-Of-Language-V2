  discussion_prompt: 'You discover a code breach at your company that violates ISC² ethics canons (e.g., Canon III: incompetent
    service) but isn''t legally reportable. Do you report it to ISC²? Debate the ethical (duty to profession), professional
    (loyalty vs. integrity), and personal (career retaliation) implications in groups of 4-5, then vote and justify positions.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    vs. mandatory); (2) Confuse with legal/SEC rules (e.g., ''Report to FBI first''); (3) Partial truth/mix-up canons (e.g.,
    Canon I instead of IV). Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter-noted confusions (ethics vs. software code breaches).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ISC² ethics. Generate 25
  high-quality flashcards for the topic ''ISC² Mandatory Reporting of Code Breaches by Certificate Holders'' (focus: reporting
  violations of ISC² Code of Ethics, NOT software code). Use this hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management
  > Professional Ethics > Whistleblowing > Reporting Obligations > ISC² Reporting.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full list above]

  - Scaffolding Layers: Distribute cards evenly (6-7 per layer) [paste full layers]

  - Active Learning: Ensure 20% cards test discussion/problem-solving scenarios.

  - Bloom''s progression: 30% Remember/Understand, 40% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate/Create.


  Follow EXACT Flashcard Schema [paste full schema]. Output ONLY JSON array of 25 flashcards, each as {"front": "...", "back":
  {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "hints": ["..."], "tags": ["..."]}}. Vary types; make MCQs challenging with protocol
  distractors. Base on accurate sources: ISC² Code (isc2.org), full canons I-IV, reporting policy. Ensure pedagogical alignment
  for active recall and higher-order thinking.'
