  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical implications of sponsoring a highly skilled but ethically questionable
    individual versus a moderately skilled but ethically sound one. Use NICE Framework KSAs to justify your position and reference
    real-world cybersecurity breaches (e.g., insider threats) as examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Plausible but incorrect: e.g., For NICE categories, distractors = similar categories (Protect/Defend vs. Operate/Maintain).'
    - 'Common misconceptions: e.g., ''Sponsorship = only mentorship'' (distractor ignores advocacy).'
    - 'Partial truths: e.g., List real KSAs but mismatch to wrong Work Role.'
    - 'Edge cases: e.g., Unqualified traits (experience without KSAs).'
    - 'Balance: 3 distractors per MCQ, 1-2 highly plausible.'

  **Completed Research Context** (integrate fully):

  ## Sponsoring Qualified Individuals for Professional Advancement in Cybersecurity

  Core Concepts: Professional Advancement (career growth to senior roles like CISO); Sponsorship (active advocacy by sponsor
  for protégé); Qualified Individuals (assessed via skills/experience/potential per standards); Cybersecurity Workforce (NICE-defined).

  Industry Standards: NICE Framework (NIST SP 800-181r1): 7 Work Role Categories (Oversee and Govern, Protect and Defend,
  Analyze, Collect and Operate, Investigate, Operate and Maintain, Securely Provision); 52 Work Roles (e.g., Cyber Defense
  Analyst under Protect/Defend); Tasks; KSAs (e.g., K0001: IT security principles). Competency Areas: Align sponsorship by
  mapping protégé KSAs to Work Roles/levels (Awareness, Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert). Ethical tie-in: Sponsors ensure
  competence to uphold codes (e.g., (ISC)²: Act honorably/professionally).

  Sponsorship Process: Assess NICE fit → Advocate opportunities → Mentor → Evaluate progress.
