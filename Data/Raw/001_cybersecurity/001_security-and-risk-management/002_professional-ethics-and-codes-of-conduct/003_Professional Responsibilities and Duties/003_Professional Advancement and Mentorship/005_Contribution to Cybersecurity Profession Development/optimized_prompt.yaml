active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how the NICE Framework and NIST CSF 2.0 can address the cybersecurity workforce
    shortage. Provide evidence from real-world examples (e.g., government initiatives) and evaluate which framework better
    supports mentorship for junior professionals.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Partial truth (e.g., list 5/6 CSF functions), 2) Common error (e.g.,
    confuse NICE Work Roles with job titles), 3) Plausible alternative (e.g., mix with another framework like CIS Controls).
    Ensure distractors test deeper understanding and avoid randomness.'

  Professional Ethics and Codes of Conduct > Professional Responsibilities and Duties > Professional Advancement and Mentorship
  > Contribution to Cybersecurity Profession Development). Voter consensus: 82.9% approval, priorities include completing
  NIST CSF 2.0 (Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover), NICE Framework (Work Role Categories e.g., Oversight
  & Governance/Protect & Defend, Work Roles, TKS), adding (ISC)² Code of Ethics and CISSP CPE.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema: Front (question), Back (answer, explanation, 3 distractors for
  MCQs, bloom_level tag, scaffolding_layer tag). Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (balance levels), active
  learning ties, 4-layer scaffolding (Foundation: definitions; Components: structures; Implementation: steps; Integration:
  connections). Ensure completeness from research: NICE lexicon for workforce, CSF 2.0 for risk-aligned skills, ethics for
  advancement.
