active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical implications of a cybersecurity professional using outdated
    tools during a breach response. How does this tie into professional codes of conduct like (ISC)²? Support your view with
    examples from NIST CSF or recent CISA alerts.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    but wrong concept (e.g., mix CSF functions), 1 extreme/overly simplistic (e.g., ignore governance). Each must have ''text''
    (brief) and ''explanation'' (1-2 sentences why wrong, cite source). Ensure plausibility for active recall testing.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security and Risk Management.\
  \ Generate 20-30 high-quality flashcards for the topic 'Maintaining Current Security Practices and Tool Knowledge' using\
  \ the EXACT topic_hierarchy provided below. Integrate university pedagogy: Bloom's Taxonomy (span all 6 levels), active\
  \ learning (scenario/discussion-style questions), scaffolding (distribute across 4 layers), and voter consensus (NIST CSF\
  \ 2.0 full details, ISO 27001, CIS Controls, MITRE ATT&CK, certs like CISSP/CEH, feeds like CISA/US-CERT, communities like\
  \ OWASP/SANS).\n\nContent Foundation:\n- Core Concepts: Security Practices (protect assets), Tool Knowledge (SIEM, IDS/IPS,\
  \ EDR), Threat Landscape, Risk Mgmt, Best Practices.\n- Frameworks: NIST CSF 2.0 (Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond,\
  \ Recover; Profiles; Tiers: Partial/Risk Informed/Repeatable/Adaptive; Continuous Improvement via Govern); ISO/IEC 27001\
