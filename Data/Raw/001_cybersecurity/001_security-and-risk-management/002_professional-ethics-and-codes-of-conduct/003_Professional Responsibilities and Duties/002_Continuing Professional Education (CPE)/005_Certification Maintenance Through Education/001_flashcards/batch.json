      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The reinstatement process after revocation typically involves a formal appeal because it requires the individual to demonstrate that the non-compliance issues have been addressed and that they are now committed to meeting ongoing requirements. This process functions by allowing the certifying body to review evidence of remediation and continued professional development before considering re-authorization.",
