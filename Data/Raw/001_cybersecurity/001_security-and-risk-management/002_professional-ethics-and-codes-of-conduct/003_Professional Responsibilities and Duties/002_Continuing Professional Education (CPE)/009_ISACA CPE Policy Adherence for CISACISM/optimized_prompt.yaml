    (e.g., ''general webinar'' vs. ''ISACA security webinar''); 4) Edge cases (e.g., hours from non-ISACA sources). Ensure

  **Core Content (Synthesize from Research/Voter Inputs):**

  - CPE ensures current knowledge in audit/security amid threats like AI/quantum risks.

  - Requirements: 120 CPE hours over 3-year cycle; min 20/year for CISA/CISM.

  - Qualifying activities: ISACA webinars/conferences, relevant training/self-study/reading (cybersecurity/audit-focused);
  documentation: certificates, agendas, hour logs (retain 5 years).

  - Non-qualifying: Unrelated personal/business training.

  - Reporting: Annual via ISACA; random audits.

  - Misconceptions: Annual=total hours; all training qualifies.


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the 6 objectives from above].

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards: 25% Layer 1 (Foundation), 25% Layer 2 (Components), 30% Layer 3 (Implementation),
  20% Layer 4 (Integration).

  - Bloom Mix: 40% Remember/Understand, 40% Apply/Analyze, 20% Evaluate/Create.

  - Active Learning Tie-Ins: Reference discussions (e.g., threat adaptation), peer teaching (documentation), problem-solving
  (scenarios) in explanations.


  **Output Format:** JSON array of flashcards, each per Flashcard Schema: {''question'': ''...'', ''options'': {''A'': ''...'',
