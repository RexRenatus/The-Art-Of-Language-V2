  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the following: ''Is data protection primarily a legal compliance issue (e.g., avoiding GDPR fines)
    or a societal ethical obligation (e.g., preventing trust erosion)? Use examples from NIST Privacy Framework Tiers and
    real-world breaches to support your position.'' (Encourages critical thinking and evaluation via peer arguments.)'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
