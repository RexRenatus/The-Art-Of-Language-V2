  Learning Objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]


  Active Learning Tie-Ins: Incorporate elements like discussion debates on ethics vs. org support, peer-teaching on CPE, problem-solving
  scenarios into card explanations or advanced cards.


  Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT scaffolding_layers ARRAY HERE]. Distribute cards across layers.


  Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (nist.gov/cyberframework), NIST SP 800-53 (nist.gov), ISO 27001/27002 (iso.org), (ISC)² Code of Ethics
  (isc2.org/ethics).


  Generate flashcards per schema: [INSERT flashcard_generation_schema HERE]. Ensure completeness (CPE details, ethics enforcement,
  consequences), alignment to certification subdomain, and distractors per protocol. Output ONLY a JSON array of 25-35 flashcards,
  no additional text.'
