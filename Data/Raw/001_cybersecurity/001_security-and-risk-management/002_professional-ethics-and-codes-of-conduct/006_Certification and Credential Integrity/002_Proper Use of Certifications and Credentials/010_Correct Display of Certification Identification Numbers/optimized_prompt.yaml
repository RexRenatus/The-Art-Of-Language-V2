active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios should certification identification numbers (CINs) be publicly displayed versus kept
    private? Debate the balance between transparency for stakeholders (e.g., proving qualifications) and risks to security
    or misuse (e.g., impersonation or phishing). Reference (ISC)² Code of Ethics.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Topic: Correct Display of Certification
  Identification Numbers (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Professional Ethics and Codes of Conduct
  > Certification and Credential Integrity > Proper Use of Certifications and Credentials > Correct Display of Certification
  Identification Numbers). Use these sources: (ISC)² Code of Ethics (no misrepresentation), CompTIA credential guidelines,
  best practices (display only active certs as ''CISSP #ID - Valid until DATE'', no alterations).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert array above]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert array above]

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to discussion/problem-solving (e.g., scenario Qs).


  Generate 25 flashcards following this schema exactly: [insert flashcard_schema.structure above]. Output as JSON array of
  objects, each with ''type'', ''front'', ''back'' (nested answer/explanation/bloom_level), ''layer'' (1-4), ''source''. Ensure
  distractors are plausible per protocol. Balance: 30% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 40% APPLY/ANALYZE, 30% EVALUATE/CREATE. Promote
  active learning and Bloom''s progression.'
