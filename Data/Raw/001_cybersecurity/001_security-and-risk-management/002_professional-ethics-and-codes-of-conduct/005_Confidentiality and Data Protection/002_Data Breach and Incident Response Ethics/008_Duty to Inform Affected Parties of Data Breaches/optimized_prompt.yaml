  Research Context: [Complete Summary]

  A data breach is unauthorized access/disclosure/loss/theft of sensitive data. Duty to inform: legal/ethical obligation to
  notify affected data subjects for protection.

  Key Terms: Personal Data, Data Subject, Controller (determines processing), Processor (processes on behalf), Supervisory
  Authority, Risk/High Risk.

  Standards:

  - NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3: Incident Handling Guide (Preparation, Detection/Analysis, Containment/Eradication/Recovery, Post-Incident:
  notify stakeholders, lessons learned).

  - GDPR (EU): Art 33: Notify supervisory authority within 72 hours; Art 34: Direct to data subjects if high risk (no undue
  delay, clear language on risks/remedies).

  - HIPAA (US Health): Breach Notification Rule - 60 days to individuals (>500), 60 days aggregate annual report (<500), HHS
  within 60 days (>500).

  - CCPA/CPRA (CA): Notify consumers ''without unreasonable delay'' if personal info compromised; right to know/delete.

  Case Studies: Equifax (2017: 147M affected, delayed notice, $700M fine); Yahoo (2013-14: 3B accounts, SEC fines for late
  disclosure).
