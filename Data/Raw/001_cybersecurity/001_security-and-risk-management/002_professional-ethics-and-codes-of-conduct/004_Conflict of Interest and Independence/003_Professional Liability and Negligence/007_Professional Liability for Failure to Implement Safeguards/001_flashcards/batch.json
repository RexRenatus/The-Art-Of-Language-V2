        "core_logic": "The Personnel Security (PS) family's purpose is to manage human-related risks because personnel actions can significantly impact security, since vetting, screening, and ongoing management are crucial; this functions by establishing policies for screening, termination, transfer, and sanctions.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors misattribute functions from other NIST control families (Configuration Management, Incident Response, Physical Protection) to the PS family, which is specifically focused on managing the human element of security.",
        "analogy": "The PS family is like the HR department's security protocols for employees, covering background checks, access provisioning/revocation, and disciplinary actions, ensuring trustworthy personnel."
