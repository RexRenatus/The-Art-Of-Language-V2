active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a scenario where a cybersecurity professional discovers a vulnerability that could compromise availability
    during a high-stakes operation, debate the ethical trade-offs between immediate disclosure (risking confidentiality) and
    delayed patching (risking negligence claims). How does this align with professional codes of conduct and NIST risk management
    frameworks?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    principles: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Plausible misconception (e.g., swap CIA principles), 2) Common opposite/error
      (e.g., overemphasize one pillar), 3) Unrelated concept (e.g., from ethics without CIA link). Ensure distractors test
      subtle understanding.'
    examples: 'Q: What protects Confidentiality? Distractors: ''Backups (availability mix-up)'', ''Audit logs (integrity)'',
      ''Firewalls (too broad)''.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST-aligned content. Topic:
  ''Minimization of Risks to Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad)'' in corrected hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > Security and Risk Management > Security Risk Management > Risk Assessment and Mitigation > CIA Triad Protection > Minimization
  of Risks to CIA.


  Core content: CIA definitions (Confidentiality: authorized access; Integrity: accuracy/trustworthiness; Availability: timely
  access). Frameworks: NIST SP 800-30 (risk assessments), SP 800-53 (controls), SP 800-37 Rev. 2 (RMF: Prepare, Categorize,
  Select, Implement, Assess, Authorize, Monitor), CSF 2.0 (Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover). Links to
  ethics, conflict of interest, negligence.

  - Scaffolding: Generate 5 flashcards per layer from [insert scaffolding_layers array].

  - Active learning ties: Reference discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving in explanations.

  - Prior knowledge: Anchor to basics like passwords/backups.


  Output 25 high-quality flashcards in JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''references'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''1'', ''bloom'': ''Remember'', ''tip'': ''...''}}, ...]. Follow flashcard_schema
  exactly. Use distractor_protocol for MCQs. Ensure progressive complexity, measurable verbs, formative assessment style.
  Prioritize active recall, accuracy, completeness (e.g., full RMF steps).'
