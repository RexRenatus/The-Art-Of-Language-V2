  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the following scenario: A cybersecurity analyst discovers a high-impact
    vulnerability but has a financial stake in the vendor''s stock. How should the Conflict Resolution Prioritization Framework
    guide resolution? Consider impacts on stakeholders, ethics canons, and organizational objectives. Support arguments with
    (ISC)² Code or NISTIR 8286B references.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
