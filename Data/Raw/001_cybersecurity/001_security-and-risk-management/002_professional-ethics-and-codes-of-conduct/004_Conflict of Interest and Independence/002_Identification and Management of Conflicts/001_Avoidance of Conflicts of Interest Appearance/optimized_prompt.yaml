  peer_teaching: 'In pairs, role-play: One partner explains COI vs. appearance of COI to a ''junior cybersecurity analyst''
    using a simple scenario (e.g., holding vendor stock); switch roles, then provide peer feedback on clarity and accuracy.'
  problem_solving: 'Given a scenario where a cybersecurity consultant owns stock in a vendor being evaluated for a risk assessment:
    Outline step-by-step disclosure and recusal procedures, referencing industry standards like NIST guidelines, and propose
    mitigation measures to avoid any appearance of COI.'

    matter without financial gain''); (2) Partial truths (e.g., confuses disclosure with recusal); (3) Related but incorrect
    concepts (e.g., mixes NIST CSF with ISO 27001 specifics); (4) Overgeneralizations from cybersecurity contexts. Ensure
    distractors test nuance and force active recall.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in professional ethics under
  CISSP-style domains. Topic: ''Avoidance of Conflicts of Interest Appearance'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk
  Management > Professional Ethics and Codes of Conduct > Conflict of Interest and Independence > Identification and Management
  of Conflicts > Avoidance of Conflicts of Interest Appearance). Consensus-approved (85.7%) with voter priorities integrated.


  Core Content from Research: COI = personal interests compromising judgment; Appearance of COI = perceived by reasonable
  observer, damaging trust like actual COI. Standards: NIST SP 800-39 (roles/accountability), NIST CSF 2.0 Govern (OV.GOV-05
  ethics/oversight), ISO 27001 (A.5.1 policies). Best practices: Disclosure, recusal, transparency. Examples: Auditor with
  vendor stock, recommending familiar tools.
