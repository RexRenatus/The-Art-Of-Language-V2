active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical permissibility of dual employment for a cybersecurity consultant
    working part-time for two firms in the same industry (e.g., one specializing in endpoint security, the other in cloud
    security). Consider (ISC)² Code of Ethics Canon 1 (protect society) versus Canon 4 (advance the profession). What safeguards
    would make it ethical?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Distractors must be plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Dual employment is always illegal' vs. 'ethical
      if disclosed').
    - Draw from partial knowledge (e.g., confuse COI with general employment laws).
    - Include near-misses (e.g., correct for different context like non-cybersec industry).
    - 'Vary difficulty: 1 easy (obvious wrong), 1 medium (superficially appealing), 1 hard (subtle ethical nuance).'
    - Ensure 20-30% of cards are multiple choice for active recall testing.
