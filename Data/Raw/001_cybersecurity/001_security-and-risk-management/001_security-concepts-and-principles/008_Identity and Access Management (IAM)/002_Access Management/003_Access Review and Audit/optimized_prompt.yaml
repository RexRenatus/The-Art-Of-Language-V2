  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet using university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning,
  and 4-layer scaffolding.


  **Incorporate these exactly:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste the full learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: [Paste the full active_learning object here]

  - Scaffolding: [Paste the full scaffolding object here]

  - Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (PR.AC-01, PR.AC-04, ID.RA-01, GV.RR-01), ISO 27001 A.9, CIS Controls 5/6.


  **Flashcard Rules:**

  - Balance: 4-5 per Bloom''s level, 6-7 per scaffolding layer.

  - Types: 40% definitions (Layer 1), 30% scenarios/applications (Layers 2-3), 30% analysis/integration (Layer 4).

  - 50% MCQ (4 options, 1 correct), 30% Cloze deletion, 20% Short answer.

  - Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: Front (Question), Back (Answer + Explanation + Blooms_level + Active_learning_tie_in
  (if applicable) + Source).

  - Distractors: Strictly per protocol – plausible, misconception-based.

  - Explanations: 2-4 sentences, pedagogical tie-in, real-world example.


  Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''blooms_level'':
  ''...'', ''active_learning_tie_in'': ''...'', ''source'': ''...''}}, ...]


  Ensure flashcards promote active recall, spaced repetition, and mastery from foundation to creation.'
