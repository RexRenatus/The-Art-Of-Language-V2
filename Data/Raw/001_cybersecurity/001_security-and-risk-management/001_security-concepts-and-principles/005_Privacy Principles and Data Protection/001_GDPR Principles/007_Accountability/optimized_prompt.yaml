  Integrate:

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste the learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: Tie 20% of cards to components (e.g., debate prompts as scenarios).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards evenly across 4 layers: [Paste scaffolding_layers here].


  Use Flashcard Schema exactly: [Paste flashcard_generation_schema here]. Follow distractor protocol strictly. Each back must
  include explanation with source, Bloom''s level (from objectives), layer, and pedagogical tie-in. Balance Bloom''s: 20%
  Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate, 20% Create. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects.'
