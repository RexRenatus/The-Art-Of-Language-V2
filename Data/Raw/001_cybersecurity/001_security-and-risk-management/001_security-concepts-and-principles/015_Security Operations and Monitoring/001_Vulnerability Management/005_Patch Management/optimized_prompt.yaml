  discussion_prompt: 'Discuss the trade-offs in patch prioritization: In a resource-constrained environment with multiple
    CVEs (e.g., CVE-2023-1234 critical remote code execution vs. CVE-2023-5678 low-severity info leak), how would you balance
    urgency, exploitability, and business impact? Reference NIST SP 800-40 factors and justify your stance.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Patch Management (Topic\
  \ Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Concepts and Principles > Security Operations and Monitoring\
  \ > Vulnerability Management > Patch Management). Use NIST SP 800-40 Rev 4 ('Guide to Enterprise Patch Management Planning':\
  \ https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-40r4.pdf) and SP 1800-31 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1800-31.pdf)\
