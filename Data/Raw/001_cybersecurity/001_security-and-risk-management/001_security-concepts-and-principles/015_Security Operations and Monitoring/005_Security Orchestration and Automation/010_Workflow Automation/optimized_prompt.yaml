active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of over-automation in SecOps (e.g., false positives from
    automated responses vs. manual oversight). Use real-world examples from MSSPs and reference NIST CSF 2.0 Respond function
    to support arguments. Synthesize group consensus on best practices.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ (40% of cards): Generate 4 options (1 correct, 3 distractors). Distractors must be plausible
    (e.g., common misconceptions like ''Automation eliminates all human error'' vs. correct ''Reduces but requires oversight'').
    Base on real pitfalls from NIST CSF or SecOps (e.g., over-reliance on automation leading to false positives). Ensure distractors
    test nuance at the card''s Bloom level.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Workflow Automation (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Concepts and Principles > Security Operations and Monitoring
  > Security Orchestration and Automation > Workflow Automation).


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (20 QA, 20 MCQ, 10 advanced CREATE/EVALUATE open-ended) covering the provided learning_objectives,
  active_learning activities, and 4-layer scaffolding. Ensure even distribution: 12 Layer 1, 13 Layer 2, 13 Layer 3, 12 Layer
  4; span all Bloom levels proportionally.


  Incorporate:

  - Prerequisites: Basic SecOps, NIST IR lifecycle, scripting.

  - Big picture: Enables scalable risk mgmt in NIST CSF Respond/Recover (e.g., MSSPs handling 300K alerts).

  - Full NIST CSF 2.0: Functions (Govern=GV, Identify=ID, Protect=PR, Detect=DE, Respond=RS, Recover=RC). Automation examples:
  DE.CM-01 (alerts), RS.RP-01 (planning), RC.RP-01 (recovery plans). Gaps: Needs more AI/SOAR emphasis.

  - Concept map: Central ''Workflow Automation'' → SecOps/Risk Mgmt/NIST; Tools (scripts→SOAR); Dependencies (APIs/Data Flows).

  Strictly follow flashcard_schema for JSON output. Cards must be optimized for Anki/Quizlet: concise front (<20 words), accurate
  back, rigorous distractors/explanations. Promote active recall, spaced repetition. Tie to voter priorities: completeness,
  pedagogy, real-world relevance.'
