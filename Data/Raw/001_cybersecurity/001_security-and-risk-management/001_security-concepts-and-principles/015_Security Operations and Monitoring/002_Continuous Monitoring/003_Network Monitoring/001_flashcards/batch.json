      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Behavioral analysis is key here because it focuses on deviations from normal patterns, such as unexpected outbound communication, which often signifies a compromised system attempting to exfiltrate data or communicate with a command-and-control server. It works by establishing a profile of normal behavior and flagging significant departures.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors focus on specific, less relevant monitoring types: port scanning (a different type of activity), bandwidth utilization (a symptom, not the core indicator), or device health (unrelated to traffic destination/content).",
        "analogy": "Detecting unusual outbound traffic is like noticing someone carrying a large, suspicious package out of a building late at night; it deviates from normal behavior and warrants investigation, unlike just checking if the building's lights are on."
