active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of cloud computing under the Shared Responsibility Model (e.g., AWS), debate where the
    security control boundaries should be drawn between the cloud provider and customer for a web application using S3 buckets,
    EC2 instances, and Lambda functions. What factors influence these boundaries (e.g., data classification, compliance requirements),
    and what risks arise from misdefining them (e.g., assuming provider secures customer data)?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions: 1) Overly broad (e.g., include
    external services); 2) Provider-overreach (e.g., customer assumes provider secures data); 3) Narrow/missing elements (e.g.,
    omit personnel/processes). Ensure distractors are realistic from research context (e.g., confuse on-prem vs. cloud).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST-aligned content. Generate
  high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized flashcards for the topic ''Security Control Boundaries'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > Security And Risk Management > Security Concepts and Principles > Cloud Security Principles > Shared Responsibility Model
  > Security Control Boundaries).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full array from above]

  - Active Learning: Use scenarios from discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving to inspire applied questions.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers – cite layer in tags.

  - Research Context: Base on NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2 (RMF, Task P-11), SP 800-53 Rev. 5; AWS/Azure Shared Responsibility; definitions
  of authorization boundary, information system, system elements.


  Follow this exact schema for 45 flashcards:

  Ensure active recall: Questions test misconceptions (e.g., boundary blur in cloud). Explanations scaffold from foundation
  to integration, reference sources, link to prior knowledge (Shared Responsibility). Vary difficulty per Bloom''s. Output
  ONLY the JSON array – no additional text.'
