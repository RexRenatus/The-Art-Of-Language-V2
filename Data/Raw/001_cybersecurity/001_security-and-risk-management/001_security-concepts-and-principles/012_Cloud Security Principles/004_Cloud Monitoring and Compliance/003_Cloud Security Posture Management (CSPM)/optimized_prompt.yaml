  **Context and Content (Synthesize Fully):**

  - **Big Picture:** CSPM enables proactive cloud risk reduction in cloud-native era; fits zero-trust; 80% breaches from misconfigs
  (Palo Alto Networks, Tenable).

  - **Prerequisites:** CIA triad, least privilege, cloud models (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS), SIEM/log analysis.

  - **Core Definitions:** CSPM: Automates misconfig/risk detection-remediation across clouds (AWS/Azure/GCP). Misconfigs:
  Insecure settings (e.g., public S3). Multi/hybrid cloud support.

  - **Comparisons:** CSPM (posture/config) vs. CNAPP (app-native full-stack), CWPP (workloads), CIEM (identity), DSPM (data
  security).

  - **Standards:** CIS Benchmarks (cloud best practices), NIST SP 800-53 (controls), PCI-DSS (payments), SOC 2 (trust), HIPAA
  (health), GDPR (privacy)—CSPM automates checks.

  - **Layers:** Use scaffolding: L1 Foundation (defs), L2 Components (tools/standards), L3 Implementation (deploy/workflows),
  L4 Integration (CNAPP/zero-trust).

  - **Concept Map:** CSPM → Misconfigs | Multi/Hybrid Cloud | Standards (CIS/NIST/PCI/etc.) | Tools (Prisma, Prowler) | Integrations
  (CNAPP).


  **Learning Objectives (Target Evenly):** [Insert full list from JSON above].


  **Active Learning Ties:** Link cards to discussion (CSPM vs CNAPP debate), peer-teach (comparisons), problem-solving (S3/IAM
  scenarios).


  **Output 50 Cards Exactly:** JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''Question'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''references'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''1-4'', ''type'': ''MCQ/Cloze/etc.''}}]. Follow
  schema strictly: Varied types, distractors plausible/misconception-based, explanations comprehensive (why correct/wrong,
  links). Ensure progressive scaffolding (10-15 cards/layer), voter-approved completeness.'
