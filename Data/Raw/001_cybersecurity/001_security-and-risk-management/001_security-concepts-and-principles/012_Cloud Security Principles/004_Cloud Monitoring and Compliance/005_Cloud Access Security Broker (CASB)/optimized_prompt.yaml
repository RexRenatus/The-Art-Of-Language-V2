active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between CASB visibility into Shadow IT and user privacy concerns. Use real-world
    examples, such as a company discovering unsanctioned SaaS usage (e.g., Dropbox) leading to a data breach, and reference
    regulations like GDPR/HIPAA.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    are plausible for cybersecurity learners, grounded in research (e.g., Shadow IT vs. sanctioned IT).'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Cloud Access Security Broker\
  \ (CASB) within the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Concepts and Principles > Cloud\
  \ Security Principles > Cloud Monitoring and Compliance > CASB.\n\nGenerate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for university-level\
  \ pedagogy (Bloom's Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Cover all VCDT functions completely: Visibility/Compliance\
  \ (Shadow IT discovery, audits), Data Security (encryption/tokenization/key management, DLP), Threat Protection (malware/UEBA/anomaly\
  \ detection), Granular Control (policies/access). Position CASB in SASE/Zero Trust/hybrid cloud contexts.\n\nIncorporate:\n\
  - Learning objectives: [insert full list from 'learning_objectives']\n- Active learning: Tie flashcards to discussion (privacy\
  \ vs. visibility), peer teaching (VCDT diagrams), problem-solving (Shadow IT scenarios with ROI).\n- Scaffolding: Distribute\
  \ cards across 4 layers [insert full scaffolding descriptions].\n\nUse exact schema:\n{\n  'flashcard_id': 1,\n  'front':\
