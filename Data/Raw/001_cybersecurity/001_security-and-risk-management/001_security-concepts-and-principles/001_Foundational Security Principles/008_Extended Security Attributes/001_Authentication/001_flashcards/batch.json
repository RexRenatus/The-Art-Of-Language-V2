While biometrics are generally difficult to spoof, sophisticated attacks can bypass them. Therefore, NIST guidelines typically require biometrics to be used as a factor in multi-factor authentication, often bound to a physical authenticator, to mitigate the risks of compromise and spoofing, and to address the inability to change compromised biometric data.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors misrepresent biometric risks by focusing on forgetfulness, hardware costs, or lack of uniqueness, rather than the critical issues of immutability (cannot be changed if compromised) and potential for spoofing, which are the primary security concerns.",
        "analogy": "Using your fingerprint to log in is like using your unique face. The risk is that if someone could perfectly copy your fingerprint or face (spoofing), they could potentially impersonate you forever, because you can't change your fingerprint or face like you can change a password."

This makes them prime targets for attacks like guessing (brute-force or dictionary attacks), phishing (tricking users into revealing them), and social engineering. Because these secrets can be compromised through various means, NIST guidelines often recommend MFA when 'something you know' is used, especially for sensitive data, to mitigate these significant risks.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly attribute risks associated with other authentication factors (physical possession, biometric spoofing, immutability) to 'something you know,' failing to identify the specific vulnerabilities of memorized secrets like passwords.",
        "analogy": "A password is like a secret handshake. The risk is that someone might see you do it, overhear you talking about it, or trick you into revealing it. It's not like a physical key you could lose, or your face which is hard to copy perfectly."
