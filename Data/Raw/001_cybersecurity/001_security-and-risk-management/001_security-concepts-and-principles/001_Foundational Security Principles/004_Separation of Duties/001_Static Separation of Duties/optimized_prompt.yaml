active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of implementing Static SoD versus Dynamic SoD in a high-security
    financial institution. Use real-world examples like the Enron scandal (lack of SoD leading to fraud) or Wells Fargo fake
    accounts scandal to support your arguments. Consider factors like enforcement complexity, flexibility, and compliance
    with NIST AC-5.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors from: 1) Misconceptions (e.g., ''Static SoD allows real-time changes'' – no,
    that''s dynamic). 2) Partial truths (e.g., role assignment without conflict matrix). 3) Real-world violations (e.g., Enron-style
    single-user control). 4) Edge cases (e.g., low-risk processes). Ensure 70% misconception-based, 30% advanced traps for
    higher Bloom''s levels.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Static Separation of Duties
  (SoD). Use the following context to create 25 high-quality flashcards:


  **Topic Hierarchy:** Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Concepts and Principles > Foundational Security
  Principles > Separation of Duties > Static Separation of Duties.


  **Research Context:** Static SoD enforces predefined role-based separations before actions (vs. dynamic real-time checks).
  Key standard: NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 AC-5 (separate duties, document authorizations). Sources: NIST SP 800-53r5 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf),
  NIST CSF, SOX. Examples: Enron/Wells Fargo violations; SAP ERP implementations.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the learning_objectives array here]


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the scaffolding array here]


  **Active Learning Integration:** Draw from discussion/activities for scenario-based cards.


  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly follow the provided structure. For each flashcard:

  - Front: Engaging question (MCQ preferred).

  - Back: Answer, explanation (link to objectives/layers/research/examples), references.

  - Include 3 distractors per MCQ using the distractor protocol.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"front": "...", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "references":
  "..."}, "distractors": ["A", "B", "C"], "bloom_level": "Remember", "scaffolding_layer": 1}.

  Ensure pedagogical alignment: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, misconception correction.'
