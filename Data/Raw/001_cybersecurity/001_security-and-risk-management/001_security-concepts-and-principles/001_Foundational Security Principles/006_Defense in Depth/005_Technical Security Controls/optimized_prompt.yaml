active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the limitations of relying solely on technical security controls (e.g.,
    firewalls and encryption) versus integrating them with administrative and physical controls in a Defense in Depth model.
    Provide real-world examples from breaches like SolarWinds and support your arguments with NIST CSF functions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse AC with SC); 2) Related but incorrect
      framework (e.g., NIST CSF ''Identify'' vs ''Protect''); 3) Partial truth (e.g., ''Encryption protects integrity only''
      omitting confidentiality). Ensure distractors test nuance, not trivia. No ''all/none'' options.'
    example: 'Q: Which NIST SP 800-53 family includes boundary protection like firewalls? A. AC (distractor: access only)
      B. SC (correct) C. SI (distractor: integrity focus) D. AU (distractor: auditing)'

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema. Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding Layers: Distribute 5-7 cards per layer [INSERT FULL LAYERS FROM ABOVE]. Progress from Layer 1 (foundation)
  to Layer 4 (integration).

  - Active Learning Tie-Ins: Include 3-5 cards inspired by discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving (e.g., scenario prompts).

  - Research Context: NIST CSF 2.0 (Govern/Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover), NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 (technical families:
  AC, AU, CM, IA, SC, SI; examples: firewalls-SC-7, encryption-SC-28, IDS-SI-4), ISO 27001, CIS Controls. Defense in Depth:
  layered technical (e.g., IDS/IPS), admin, physical controls protecting CIA triad.

  answer","explanation":"Detailed explanation with sources and distractor rationale if MCQ","source":"NIST SP 800-53"}}. For
  MCQs, include distractors in front (e.g., ''A. Opt1 B. Opt2 (correct) C. Opt3 D. Opt4'') and explain all in back. Ensure
  active recall, no cues in front. Variety: 40% MCQ (plausible distractors per protocol), 30% Q&A, 20% apply scenarios, 10%
  create/critique. Make explanations 50-100 words for deep learning.'
