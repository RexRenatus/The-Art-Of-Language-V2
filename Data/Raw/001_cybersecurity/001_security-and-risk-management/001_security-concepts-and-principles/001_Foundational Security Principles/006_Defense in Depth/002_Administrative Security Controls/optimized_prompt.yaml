active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how administrative security controls address human factors in cybersecurity
    breaches (e.g., phishing). Provide real-world examples like the 2020 Twitter Bitcoin scam and evaluate their role in preventing
    recurrence.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (40% of cards): Create 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse
    policies with technical controls; mix standards/procedures). Ensure distractors are realistic from research context (e.g.,
    ''firewalls'' as distractor for administrative). One correct, three wrong.'

  Use this optimized learning content:

  - **Research Context**: Administrative controls are managerial policies/procedures (e.g., security policies, standards,
  procedures, ISMS, risk management, awareness training) that govern human/org processes in Defense in Depth. Key: Policies
  (high-level), Standards (mandatory), etc. Sources: NIST SP 800-53, ISO 27001, CISSP Official Study Guide.

  - **Learning Objectives**: [Insert full list from above].

  - **Scaffolding**: [Insert full 4 layers from above, including prior knowledge, examples, assessments].

  - **Active Learning**: Incorporate prompts/elements into explanations (e.g., ''Relates to discussion on human factors'').

  Distribute across Bloom''s levels and layers proportionally. Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, scaffolding progression,
  measurable verbs. Voter priorities: Precise examples, real-world cases (e.g., Equifax), no stray content. Output as JSON
  array of objects, each with ''front'' and ''back'' (back as object). Begin with summary: {''total'':75, ''distribution'':{...}}.'
