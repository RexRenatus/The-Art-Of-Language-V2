active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of fail-secure versus fail-open designs in high-availability systems like hospitals
    or e-commerce platforms. Use real-world examples (e.g., electronic door locks that lock on power failure vs. emergency
    exit doors that unlock) and reference NIST SP 800-207 to argue which is preferable in a Zero Trust environment.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3-4 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (fail-secure = fail-open/fail-safe);
    2) Real-world confusions (availability over security); 3) Partial truths (e.g., ''fail-open for high availability'');
    4) NIST misalignments (e.g., CSF Detect instead of Protect). Ensure distractors teach by contrast.'

  **Full Topic Content (Web-Grounded Research, Completed per Voter Consensus):**

  Fail-secure design ensures systems default to a secure state (e.g., deny access) upon failure (hardware/software issues,
  power loss, attacks), prioritizing security over availability. Contrast: Fail-open defaults to insecure (allow access).
  Secure state: Restricted access, protected data. NIST CSF: ''Protect'' function (access controls). NIST SP 800-207 Zero
  Trust: Defaults to deny access in failure until re-verified. Examples: Door locks stay locked; firewalls block traffic.
