active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a recent high-profile breach like SolarWinds, how might a robust change implementation process (e.g.,
    CAB approval, staging tests, rollback plans) have prevented or mitigated the incident? Debate the trade-offs between speed
    of deployment and security thoroughness in change management, referencing NIST SP 800-53 CM-3 and ITIL processes.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., ignore rollback), 3) Confusable terms (e.g., SSP vs POA&M), 4) Out-of-context standards (e.g., NIST CSF Identify
    vs Govern). Ensure 60-70% plausible to test discrimination.'
