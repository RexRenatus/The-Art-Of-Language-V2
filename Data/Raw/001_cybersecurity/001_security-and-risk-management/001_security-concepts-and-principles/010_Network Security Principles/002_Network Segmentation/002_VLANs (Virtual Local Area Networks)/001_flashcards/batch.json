        "core_logic": "Implementing strict ACLs on routers or Layer 3 switches is a best practice that directly supports NIST SP 800-53 control AC-4 (Information Flow Enforcement). By defining explicit rules for traffic flow between VLANs, organizations can precisely control communication paths, ensuring that only authorized traffic passes between segments and preventing unauthorized information flow, thereby managing network risk.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors suggest practices that would either negate VLAN benefits, create security risks, or be impractical, rather than aligning with AC-4's goal of controlled information flow.",
        "analogy": "ACLs on inter-VLAN routing are like a customs checkpoint between countries (VLANs), meticulously checking what goods (traffic) are allowed to cross the border."
