active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast 802.1X authentication with password-based login systems in terms of security, usability,
    and scalability. Which would you recommend for a university campus network and why? Consider factors like device density,
    user mobility, and management overhead.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    terms (e.g., EAP vs. EAPOL, Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Port); 3) Partial truths (e.g., ''802.1X only for wireless'');
    4) Real-world edge cases (e.g., MAB fallback mistaken for primary method). Ensure distractors are plausible for intermediate
    learners.'

  **Contextual Knowledge:** Use this comprehensive summary [INSERT FULL RESEARCH CONTEXT HERE, including core concept, terminology,
  and note Sources: IEEE 802.1X-2010/2020 standards (ieee.org), RFC 2865/5216 (ietf.org), Wikipedia IEEE 802.1X]. Integrate
  scaffolding layers, learning objectives, active learning, prior knowledge (OSI L2, auth basics), big picture (zero-trust,
  defense-in-depth), and common misconceptions.


  **Generate Flashcards:** Create 40-60 high-quality flashcards following the exact schema:

  - 30% Basic Q/A

  - 30% Cloze

  - 40% MCQ with distractors per protocol

  Distribute evenly across 4 scaffolding layers (10-15 each). Tag each with Layer, Bloom''s Level (from objectives), Hierarchy,
  Source.


  **Pedagogical Rules:**

  - Align to Bloom''s progression.

  - Promote active recall (no cues in questions).

  - Explanations scaffold: reference objectives/activities (e.g., ''Supports discussion on scalability'').

  - Distractors: Plausible, misconception-based.


  **Output Format (JSON Array):** [{''type'': ''Basic|MCQ|Cloze'', ''layer'': 1-4, ''blooms_level'': ''Remember'', ''hierarchy'':
  ''Level 6: 802.1X'', ''source'': ''IEEE 802.1X'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...''}]


  Generate now, ensuring completeness, accuracy, and engagement.'
