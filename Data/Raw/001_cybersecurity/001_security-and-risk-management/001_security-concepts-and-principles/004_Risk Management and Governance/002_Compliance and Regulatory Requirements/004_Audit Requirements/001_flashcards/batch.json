        {

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Control dependency is significant because the failure of a foundational control can render dependent controls ineffective, necessitating a broader testing scope. It works by auditors identifying these relationships and testing prerequisite controls to ensure the overall effectiveness of the control objective being addressed.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors misinterpret dependency as redundancy, a hierarchy of effectiveness, or an absolute failure condition, rather than a relationship requiring comprehensive testing.",
        "analogy": "Control dependency is like building a house of cards: the stability of the top cards depends entirely on the integrity of the cards below them. If a lower card is weak or missing, the entire structure is at risk, so you must ensure all supporting cards are sound."
