      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Applying 'least privilege' to UAM tool deployment is essential because it limits the potential exposure of sensitive user data, since monitoring tools and personnel should only have access to the data strictly required for their security functions.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly apply least privilege to end-users, suggest dynamic revocation, or advocate for maximum monitoring access, failing to grasp that it pertains to the access rights of the monitoring system itself.",
