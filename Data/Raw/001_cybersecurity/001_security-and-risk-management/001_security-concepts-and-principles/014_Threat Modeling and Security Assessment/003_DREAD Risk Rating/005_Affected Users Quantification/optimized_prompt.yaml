active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the relative importance of Affected Users Quantification versus other DREAD
    factors (e.g., Exploitability) when prioritizing limited cybersecurity resources in a threat modeling workflow. Use real-world
    examples like the Equifax breach to support your arguments and connect to NIST CSF 2.0's Identify and Govern functions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (2) Edge case exaggeration (e.g., ''100%: Employees only'' instead of ''All users''), (3) Framework mix-up (e.g., NIST
    CSF term instead of DREAD scale). Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter accuracy notes and research (e.g., post-incident
    vs. threat modeling contexts).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in DREAD Risk Rating under
  Threat Modeling. Topic: Affected Users Quantification (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security
  Concepts and Principles > Threat Modeling and Security Assessment > DREAD Risk Rating > Affected Users Quantification).

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding: Structure flashcards progressively across 4 layers: [INSERT FULL LAYER DESCRIPTIONS FROM ABOVE]. Aim for
  5-8 cards per layer.

  - Ensure connection to DREAD (5 factors), rating scale (0%: None, 10%: Few, 25%: Some, 50%: Many, 100%: All), NIST CSF 2.0
  (Identify/Govern), NISTIR 8286B (prioritization), and threat modeling workflow.


  Generate flashcards using this schema: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD SCHEMA FROM ABOVE].


  Output ONLY a numbered list of flashcards in CSV-like format for easy import: ''Front|Back|Tags''. Cover all Bloom''s levels,
  voter priorities (completeness, accuracy, pedagogy), and research context (quantification methods: logs, sampling; big-picture
  risk mgmt).'
