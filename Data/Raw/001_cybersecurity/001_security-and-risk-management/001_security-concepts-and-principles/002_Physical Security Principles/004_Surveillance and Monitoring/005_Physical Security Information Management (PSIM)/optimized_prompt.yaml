active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs of implementing a vendor-agnostic PSIM system in a critical infrastructure like
    a nuclear power plant. Compare it to vendor-specific solutions, debating integration challenges, cost implications, and
    risk mitigation benefits. Consider potential misconceptions that PSIM is merely a video aggregator rather than a full
    intelligence platform.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains the core components of PSIM (Device Management, Data Analysis and Correlation,
    Information Presentation, Workflow and SOP Guidance, Reporting and Auditing) using examples from surveillance (CCTV) and
    access control. The partner then performs a teach-back by applying these components to a simple scenario, such as a retail
    store breach response.
  problem_solving: In groups, analyze a scenario of an airport facing simultaneous alarms from CCTV, intrusion detection,
    and cyber alerts during peak hours. Design a PSIM-based response workflow, prioritizing events, correlating data, and
    outlining SOPs. Include non-examples, such as how unintegrated systems lead to missed threats, and discuss convergence
    with cyber SIEM.
