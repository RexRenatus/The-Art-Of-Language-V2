active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare NIST SP 800-53A and ISO 27001 gap analysis procedures. Which is better suited for a startup versus
    an enterprise, and why? Debate in groups, considering factors like cost, scalability, and certification requirements.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    only identifies missing controls'' vs. ''also ineffective ones''), 1 partially correct/overly simplistic (e.g., ''NIST
    only'' vs. ''NIST, ISO, etc.''), 1 unrelated/off-topic (e.g., ''Penetration testing'' instead of ''Gap analysis''). Ensure
    distractors are realistic, derived from research context or frameworks.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in 'Control Gap Analysis Procedures'\
  \ (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Control Frameworks > Control Implementation\
  \ and Operations > Control Testing and Validation > Control Gap Analysis Procedures). Use the provided learning objectives,\
  \ active learning activities, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema to generate high-quality, pedagogically optimized\
  \ flashcards.\n\nIncorporate comprehensive content: Definitions (gap analysis, current/target state, gaps, remediation);\
  \ Frameworks (NIST SP 800-53A Rev5: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53Ar5.pdf [2023],\
