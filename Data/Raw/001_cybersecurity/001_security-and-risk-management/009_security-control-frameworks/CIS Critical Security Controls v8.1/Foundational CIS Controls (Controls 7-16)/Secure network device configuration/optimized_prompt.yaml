active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how secure network device configuration fits into zero-trust architectures
    and its role in preventing misconfiguration attacks (citing Verizon DBIR statistics). Predict the impact of a single default
    password breach on an enterprise network.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
