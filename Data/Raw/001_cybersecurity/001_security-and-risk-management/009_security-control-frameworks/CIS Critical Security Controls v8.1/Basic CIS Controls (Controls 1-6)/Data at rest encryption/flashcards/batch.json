      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "FDE's primary benefit is protecting all data if the laptop is lost or stolen because it encrypts the entire disk, making data unreadable without authentication; this works by requiring a pre-boot authentication or decryption key, which is a prerequisite for preventing unauthorized access to stored information.",

        "analogy": "Full-disk encryption on a laptop is like having your entire house (disk) locked with a very strong, complex lock (encryption key) that must be opened before anyone can enter, protecting everything inside if the house is broken into (laptop lost/stolen)."

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The algorithm's strength and resistance to attacks are critical because a weak algorithm can be easily broken, negating the purpose of encryption; strong algorithms like AES-256 work by applying complex mathematical transformations that are computationally infeasible to reverse without the key, a prerequisite for ensuring data confidentiality against sophisticated adversaries.",
