active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate whether automated tools (e.g., SCIM-integrated IAM) or manual processes are better for deprovisioning
    offboarded employees, considering trade-offs in speed, accuracy, and risk of orphaned accounts. Support with examples
    from CIS Control 5.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
