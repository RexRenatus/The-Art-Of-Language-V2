      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Application whitelisting's strength against unknown threats lies in its 'permit by exception' model; since it only allows explicitly authorized software, any new or unknown malicious code will be blocked by default, because it's not on the approved list. This functions by establishing a strict baseline of 'known good'.",
