  discussion_prompt: 'In a debate format, argue for or against the statement: ''Disabling default accounts should be mandatory
    for all devices, even if it causes temporary operational disruptions.'' Support arguments with CIS Control 4.8 examples,
    real breaches like the Mirai botnet (which exploited default credentials on IoT devices), and counterpoints on business
    continuity.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in CIS Critical Security Controls\
  \ v8.1. Topic: 'Default account disablement' (focus: disabling vendor-supplied default accounts like admin/admin per CIS\
  \ Control 4.8 'Manage Default Accounts'; distinguish from dormant accounts in CIS 5.4/5.5). Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity\
  \ > Security And Risk Management > Security Control Frameworks > CIS Critical Security Controls v8.1 > Basic CIS Controls\
  \ (1-6) > Default account disablement.\n\nGenerate 20 high-quality flashcards (8 Basic Q/A, 8 MCQ, 4 Application Scenario)\
  \ optimized for spaced repetition and Bloom's Taxonomy. Cover all learning objectives evenly (at least 3-4 per level). Use\
  \ 4-layer scaffolding progressively (Layer 1: 30%, Layer 2: 25%, Layer 3: 25%, Layer 4: 20%). Incorporate active learning\
