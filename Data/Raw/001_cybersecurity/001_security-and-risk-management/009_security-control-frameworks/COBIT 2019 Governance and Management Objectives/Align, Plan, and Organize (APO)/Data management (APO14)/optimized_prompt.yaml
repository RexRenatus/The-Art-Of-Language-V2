active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a post-data breach world like Equifax, debate whether strict data minimization (e.g., NIST PM-25 principles)
    hinders business innovation or enhances security. Consider trade-offs in applying COBIT APO14 to PII lifecycle management.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Active Learning Hooks: [insert discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving above] – weave into card explanations/hooks.

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert 4 layers above] – tag each card with primary layer.

  - Research Context: Data management per APO14 ensures data protection across lifecycle (creation to disposal), focusing
  on PII, CIA triad. Complete NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 controls: PM family (PM-25 minimization), PL (planning), RA (RA-8 assessments),
  SA (SA-5 documentation, SA-8 engineering principles, SA-9 external info sharing). Sources: NIST SP 800-53r5 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf),
