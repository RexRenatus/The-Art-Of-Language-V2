active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate whether achieving 'Optimized' maturity in NIST CSF-MM is realistic for small-to-medium enterprises
    (SMEs). Debate the trade-offs between maturity gains, implementation costs, operational agility, and business priorities.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create distractors as common misconceptions: e.g., confuse CSF functions (mix ''Detect'' with ''Respond'');
    misdefine maturity levels (e.g., claim ''Partial'' is fully formalized); swap framework elements (e.g., NIST CSF vs. ISO
    27001); use real but irrelevant terms (e.g., ''CMMI Level 5'' for Optimized). Ensure distractors are 70-80% plausible
    to challenge understanding without frustrating learners.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy.
  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards on ''Maturity Roadmap Development'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk
  Management > Security Control Frameworks > Framework Governance and Compliance > Control Framework Maturity > Maturity Roadmap
  Development).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the array above]

  - Active Learning: [reference components above for tie-ins]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste full layer details above; ensure flashcards progress from Layer 1 to 4]

  - Voter Consensus: Fully define NIST CSF-MM levels (Partial: incomplete/ad hoc; Risk Informed: formalized risk mgmt; Repeatable:
  consistent processes; Adaptive: proactive adaptation; Optimized: continuous innovation). NIST CSF functions: Govern, Identify,
  Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.

  - Research Context: Cybersecurity Maturity Model (tiered effectiveness, TechTarget); Roadmap (strategic journey, CompTIA);
  Risk Mgmt/Governance (NIST).


  Use exact Flashcard Schema: JSON array of objects with ''type'', ''front'', ''back'' {''correct_answer'', ''explanation'',
  ''distractors''}. Follow distractor protocol and explanation requirements strictly. Ensure Bloom''s progression, active
  learning links, and comprehensive coverage of NIST CSF/CSF-MM for roadmap dev. Output only the JSON array.'
