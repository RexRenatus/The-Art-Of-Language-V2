active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages and challenges of FedRAMP's standardized approach versus
    agency-specific authorizations. Consider impacts on CSPs like Azure Government and federal agencies' adoption speed. Support
    arguments with references to impact levels and RMF integration.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    of 3); 2) Partial truth/mix-up (e.g., confuse Moderate with High controls); 3) Related but incorrect term (e.g., ''FISMA''
    for ''3PAO role''). Ensure distractors test subtle understanding, not trivia.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in FedRAMP authorization requirements
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Control Frameworks > Framework Governance and
  Compliance > Regulatory Compliance Management > FedRAMP authorization requirements). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards
  optimized for Anki/Quizlet, covering all Bloom''s levels via these learning objectives: [insert full learning_objectives
  array here]. Incorporate prior knowledge (cloud basics, NIST SP 800-53, FISMA) and address misconceptions.


  Structure content via 4-layer scaffolding: [insert full scaffolding object here]. Use research context: FedRAMP standardizes
  cloud auth via RMF (NIST 800-37), 800-53 controls, impact levels (Low/Mod/High), process (SSP, Readiness, 3PAO, PMO submit,
  JAB/Agency ATO, Monitor), roles (CSP/3PAO/JAB), examples (AWS GovCloud, Azure Gov). Sources: fedramp.gov, NIST docs.
