active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the effectiveness of current social engineering defenses in your organization or a hypothetical
    one. What gaps exist (e.g., in human risk identification from RA family controls), and how can NIST SP 800-50 guidelines
    address them through customized training?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Completed Research Context:

  Social engineering defense training educates on recognizing/resisting manipulative tactics exploiting human psychology.
  Core concepts: Social engineering (manipulation for info/actions); Phishing (impersonation via email/SMS); Spear phishing
  (targeted); Malware deployment; Human risks (errors/negligence). NIST SP 800-53 AT: AT-1 Policy, AT-2 Literacy Training,
  AT-3 Role-Based, AT-4 Training Records. NIST SP 800-50 Rev. 1 ''Building a Cybersecurity Awareness and Training Program'':
  Lifecycle (planning, analysis, design, development, implementation, assessment), emphasizing awareness/training to build
  security culture.

  Related: RA (risk assessment of humans), AC (access controls).
