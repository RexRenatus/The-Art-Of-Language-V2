  discussion_prompt: 'Analyze the SolarWinds or Log4j breach: Debate how implementing SA-17 developer security architecture
    could have prevented or mitigated it through better control allocation, organizational alignment, and interoperability.
    Compare requirements in NIST SP 800-53 Rev4 vs. Rev5.'
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains a specific SA-17 component (e.g., design specs or org consistency) using a
    hand-drawn diagram; the partner provides teach-back by summarizing and quizzing on key points.
  problem_solving: 'In groups, design a security architecture for a hypothetical SaaS acquisition: Document functionality,
    control allocation, and integration per SA-17. Present findings and field peer critiques on interoperability and alignment.'

  Complete NIST details: SA-17 requires developers to produce a design specification and security/privacy architecture consistent
  with the organization''s security/privacy architecture (part of enterprise architecture), accurately describing functionality/control
  allocation and interoperability.
