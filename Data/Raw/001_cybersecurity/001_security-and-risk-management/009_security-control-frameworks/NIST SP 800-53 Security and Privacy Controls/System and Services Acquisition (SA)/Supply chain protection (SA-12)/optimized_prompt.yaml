active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast the SA-12 control in NIST SP 800-53 Rev 4 with the new SR family in Rev 5. Debate
    which approach better addresses modern supply chain threats like SolarWinds—why? Consider evolution in framework, coverage
    of lifecycle phases, and real-world efficacy.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    risks only hardware''); 2) Partial truths from related controls (e.g., confuse SA-12 with SA-4); 3) Rev 4 vs Rev 5 differences
    (e.g., outdated SA-12 scope); 4) Real-world examples twisted (e.g., SolarWinds as ''only software issue''). Ensure distractors
    teach by debunking.'
