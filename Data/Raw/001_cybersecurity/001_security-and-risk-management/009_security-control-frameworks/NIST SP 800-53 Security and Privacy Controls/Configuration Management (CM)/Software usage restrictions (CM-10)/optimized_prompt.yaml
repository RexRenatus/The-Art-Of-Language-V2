active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate whether organizations should ban all P2P file-sharing technologies outright or allow controlled
    use. Consider security risks (e.g., unauthorized distribution), productivity benefits, and legal/compliance implications
    under CM-10.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    but incorrect related concept (e.g., confuse CM-10 with CM-8 inventory only); 3) Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Ban
    all software tracking''); Ensure distractors are realistic, derived from real-world errors, research context (e.g., CIS
    misalignments), or voter-noted gaps (e.g., incomplete OSS understanding).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST SP 800-53 controls.
  Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Software Usage Restrictions (CM-10)'' in the hierarchy: Cybersecurity >
  Security And Risk Management > Security Control Frameworks > NIST SP 800-53 > Configuration Management (CM) > CM-10.


  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives** (Bloom''s Taxonomy): [Insert full learning_objectives array here].

  - **Scaffolding Layers**: [Insert full scaffolding_layers array here]. Ensure flashcards progress from Layer 1 (foundation)
  to Layer 4 (integration).

  - **Active Learning Ties**: Reference discussion (P2P bans), peer teaching (tracking methods), problem-solving (audit remediation)
  where relevant.

  - **Content Completeness**: Cover NIST Rev. 5 CM-10 (legal compliance, license tracking, P2P controls, OSS: benefits/transparency,
  risks/copyleft GPL compliance). Links: CIS 2.3/2.5, CM-8, ITSG-33. Address voter priorities: OSS guidelines, connections
  (prior: CM-1; cross: legal/ITAM).


  **Output Format**: JSON array of flashcards, each following the schema:

  [Insert full flashcard_schema.structure, distractor_protocol, explanation_requirements here].


  Generate 50 flashcards: Balanced by Bloom''s/objectives/layers. Use precise, exam-style questions. Promote active learning
  and higher-order thinking. Sources: NIST.gov, CISecurity.org.'
