active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the risks of infrequent contingency plan testing using real-world examples
    (e.g., ransomware incidents). How does CP-4 mitigate these risks, and what frequency ensures ongoing readiness?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full array from above]

  - Active Learning: Use to inspire higher-order questions (e.g., evaluative discussions).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards: Layer 1 (foundation, 20%), Layer 2 (components, 25%), Layer 3 (implementation, 25%),
  Layer 4 (integration, 30%). Prefix questions with ''Layer X:'' if relevant.

  - Best Practices: Testing frequency (annually + after changes), methods (tabletop, walkthrough, simulation, parallel, full-scale),
  process (plan/conduct/evaluate/update), sources: https://csf.tools/reference/nist-sp-800-53/r5/cp/cp-4/, https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/34/r1,
  https://www.gsa.gov/system/files/Contingency-Planning-%28CP%29-%5BCIO-IT-Security-06-29-Rev-7%5D.pdf, https://docs.security.tamu.edu/docs/security-controls/CP/CP-4/.

  - Bloom''s progression: Balance across all levels.


  Generate 25 flashcards following the exact schema: [{''question'': ''...'', ''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''type'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''...'', ''sources'': [''...'']}, ...]. Ensure university-level
  rigor, active recall, spaced repetition optimization (concise fronts, detailed backs). Vary phrasing for mastery. Output
  ONLY the JSON array.'
