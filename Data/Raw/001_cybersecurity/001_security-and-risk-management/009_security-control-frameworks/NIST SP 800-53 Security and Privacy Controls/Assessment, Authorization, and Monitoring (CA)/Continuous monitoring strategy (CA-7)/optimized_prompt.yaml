active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a resource-limited small business, debate the optimal frequency and scope of continuous monitoring
    (CA-7/ISCM) versus traditional periodic audits, referencing NIST risk tolerance guidelines and SP 800-137. Consider trade-offs
    in cost, coverage, and threat response.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one partner explains ISCM strategy components (technology, processes, metrics, risk tolerance)
    using a simple textual diagram (e.g., central 'ISCM Strategy' node connected to six steps). The partner teaches back by
    summarizing and quizzing on key points.
  problem_solving: 'In groups, design a CA-7 continuous monitoring strategy for a hypothetical healthcare organization post-breach.
    Include: specific metrics (e.g., vulnerability scan frequency), tools (e.g., SIEM in SOC, AWS GuardDuty), risk response
    plan, and integration with RMF Step 6. Present to class for feedback.'

  Incorporate this completed research context: Continuous monitoring (CA-7) develops/implements an org-level strategy per
  NIST SP 800-53 Rev5: ''Develop a continuous monitoring strategy and implement continuous monitoring...''. Ties to SP 800-137
  ISCM: Six steps - 1. Establish ISCM strategy (risk tolerance, metrics); 2. Implement strategy; 3. Prepare operations; 4.
  Implement operations (tools like SIEM); 5. Analyze data; 6. Respond/Improve. Real-world: SOCs, AWS GuardDuty/GCP SCC. Concept
  map: Central ''CA-7/ISCM Strategy'' → Six Steps → RMF Step 6 → CA-2/CA-6 → Metrics/Risk Tolerance.
