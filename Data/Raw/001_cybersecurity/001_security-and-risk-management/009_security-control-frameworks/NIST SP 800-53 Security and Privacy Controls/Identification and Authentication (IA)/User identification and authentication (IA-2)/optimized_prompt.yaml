active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a world of rising phishing attacks, should organizations enforce passwordless authentication using
    biometrics and passkeys as per NIST SP 800-53 IA-2 and SP 800-63 guidelines? Argue for or against, citing specific IA-2
    controls (e.g., multi-factor requirements), assurance levels (IAL/AAL/FAL), and real-world examples like the 2023 MOVEit
    breach. Consider trade-offs in usability, security, and compliance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse 'verifier' with 'RP'; mix up IAL/AAL/FAL).
    - 1 semi-correct (partial truth, missing key detail).
    - 1 opposite/extreme (e.g., 'passwords are always strongest').
    - 1 unrelated/off-topic (e.g., from another control like auditing).
    - Avoid obvious wrongs; ensure distractors teach by explaining errors.
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 'User\
