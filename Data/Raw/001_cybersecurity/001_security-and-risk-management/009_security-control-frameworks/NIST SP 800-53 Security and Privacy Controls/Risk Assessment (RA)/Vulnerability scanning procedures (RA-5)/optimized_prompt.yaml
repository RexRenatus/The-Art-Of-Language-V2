active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a resource-constrained organization, debate the trade-offs of weekly vs. quarterly vulnerability scans
    per NIST RA-5, considering false positives, remediation costs, risk exposure, and compliance requirements. Support arguments
    with references to NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 enhancements.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    vuln); 2) Related but incorrect term (e.g., mix RA-5 with RA-3); 3) Extreme/overly simplistic option (e.g., ''never scan'').
    Ensure distractors are 80-90% plausible to challenge learners without frustrating. Base on real-world errors from NIST
    guidance.'
