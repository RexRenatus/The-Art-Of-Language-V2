active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given recent scandals like the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica breach, debate whether Privacy Impact Assessments
    (PIAs) should be legally mandated for all organizations handling personal data, or if they hinder innovation. Support
    arguments with pros/cons, real-world examples, and references to NIST SP 800-53 RA-8.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - ''PIA is only for government/compliance'' (vs. all orgs/privacy-by-design).

    - ''PIA replaces security risk assessment'' (vs. complements RA-3).

    - ''Sensitive info excludes biometrics'' (vs. includes).

    - ''PIA is one-time'' (vs. ongoing/iterative).

    Ensure distractors are plausible, derived from partial truths or overgeneralizations.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, aligned with university pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy), active learning, and NIST standards. Generate 20 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Privacy Impact
  Assessment (RA-8)'' in the NIST SP 800-53 framework.

  **Generation Rules**:

  - Distribute: 8 MCQs (with distractors), 6 Q&A, 3 True/False, 3 Cloze.

  - Map 20-30% cards per Bloom''s level.

  - Ensure completeness: Cover NIST SP 800-53/53A Rev. 5 details, definitions, steps, comparisons, scenarios (e.g., fitness
  app, Cambridge Analytica).

  - Promote active recall: Questions require application/analysis.

  - Output: JSON array of 20 card objects in specified format. No additional text.'
