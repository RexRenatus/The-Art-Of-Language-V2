active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss the trade-offs between physical protections like Protected Distribution Systems (PDS) with Red/Black
    separation and logical protections like TLS/IPsec for implementing SC-8 and SC-9. How do these contribute to overall risk
    management in preventing MITM attacks within the NIST framework?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse integrity with availability),
    2) Similar but incorrect control (e.g., SC-13 instead of SC-8), 3) Partial truth (e.g., ''SSL'' instead of ''TLS 1.3'').
    Ensure distractors test nuance (physical vs. logical, conf vs. integ). Balance card types: 40% MCQ, 20% T/F, 20% Cloze,
    20% Short answer.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST SP 800-53 controls.
  Generate 25-30 high-quality flashcards on ''Transmission Confidentiality and Integrity (SC-8, SC-9)'' in the topic hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Control Frameworks > NIST SP 800-53 > System and Communications
  Protection (SC) > Transmission confidentiality and integrity (SC-8, SC-9).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [REMEMBER: Recall definitions...; UNDERSTAND: Explain differences...; etc.] – Tag each card.

  - Active Learning: Draw from discussion (trade-offs PDS vs. TLS), peer teaching (components/examples), problem-solving (MITM
  scenarios).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers – Foundation (defs, prior knowledge: crypto/networking), Components (SC-8/SC-9
  breakdowns), Implementation (PDS, TLS/IPsec/HTTPS/VPN steps), Integration (SC-13/risk/cloud).

  - Content Completeness: Include PDS (physical secure cabling, Red/Black), TLS 1.3/IPsec (logical crypto), FIPS, best practices
  (NIST 800-53/171, CNSSI 4009, CCM, CIS Controls). Big picture: NIST for federal risk mgmt, MITM prevention.


  Use exact Flashcard Schema:

  Front: Question ([Bloom''s Level - Layer #]). E.g., MCQ with 4 options.

  Back: **Answer:** ... | **Explanation:** ... (link NIST/examples/distractor errors) | **References:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev.
  5 SC-8/SC-9, etc. | **Related Objective:** #X.

  Distractors: 3 plausible per MCQ (misconceptions, similar controls, partial truths).


  Output as numbered list: 1. Front: ... --- Back: ... Ensure variety, no duplicates, progressive difficulty (Layer 1 easy,
  Layer 4 advanced).'
