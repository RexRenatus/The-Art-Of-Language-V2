    AU a ''control family''). 2. Partial truths (e.g., ''NTP uses GPS only''). 3. Edge cases (e.g., ''Synchronization tolerance
    of 1 hour''). 4. Real-world pitfalls (e.g., ''Smartphone time is enterprise-grade''). Ensure plausibility for active recall

  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives** (span Bloom''s Taxonomy): [Insert full learning_objectives array here].

  - **Active Learning**: Embed prompts like ''Debate GPS vs. atomic clocks'' or ''Troubleshoot desync in mock IR'' into explanations.

  - **Scaffolding**: Distribute cards across 4 layers: [Insert full scaffolding array here].

  - **Research Context**: AU-8 (Timestamps): Requires internal system clocks for audit record timestamps (NIST SP 800-53 Rev
  5). SC-45: System clock sync. UTC standard. NTP/NTS (RFC 8633: Network Time Security). Risks: Log skew (SolarWinds), Kerberos
  failures. Sources: NIST SP 800-53r5 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf), RFC 8633
  (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8633), NTP.org.


  **Output Format**: JSON array of flashcards, each matching this schema: [Insert full flashcard_schema.structure here]. Strictly
  follow distractor protocol. Ensure cards promote active recall, spaced repetition, and progression from foundation to integration.
  Generate exactly 50 flashcards, balanced by Bloom''s levels and layers.'
