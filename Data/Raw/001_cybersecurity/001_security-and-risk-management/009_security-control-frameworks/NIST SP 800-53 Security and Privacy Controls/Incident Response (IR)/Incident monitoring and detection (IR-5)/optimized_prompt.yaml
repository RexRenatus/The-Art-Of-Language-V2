active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a resource-constrained environment, should organizations prioritize monitoring for known IoCs or invest
    in behavioral anomaly detection for unknown threats? Debate pros/cons with real-world examples like SolarWinds supply
    chain attack, referencing NIST CSF DE.CM and MTTD/MTTR impacts.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one explains NIST hierarchy (event → adverse event → incident) with definitions and examples/non-examples
    (e.g., routine logoff as non-incident); switch roles and quiz partner on distinctions, then share insights with group.
  problem_solving: Analyze anonymized network logs showing unusual outbound traffic and failed logins (simulated IoCs); identify
    TTPs via CTI/MITRE ATT&CK, classify as incident, propose IR-5 detection enhancements and initial response steps.

  distractor_protocol: '3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions: e.g., confuse ''event'' (routine)
    with ''incident'' (jeopardy to CIA); IoC as CTI (IoC=artifacts, CTI=enriched); TTPs as tools not behaviors. Ensure distractors
    are realistic (e.g., partial truths from NIST).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST SP 800-53 IR-5: Incident
  Monitoring and Detection. Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy progression, active learning, 4-layer scaffolding.
  Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Control Frameworks > NIST SP 800-53 > Incident
  Response (IR) > IR-5.


  Sources: NIST SP 800-53 Rev5 (IR-5), SP 800-61r3 (definitions: event=observable occurrence; adverse event=potential negative
  impact; incident=jeopardizes CIA/policies), SP 800-150 (IoCs=artifacts; CTI=enriched threat info; TTPs=attacker behaviors),
  NIST CSF (DE.CM for detection → RS Respond), MITRE ATT&CK (TTP mapping).


  BIG PICTURE: IR-5 enables early detection in IR lifecycle, reducing MTTD/MTTR for resilience. Concept map: Central ''IR-5''
  → Event/Adverse Event/Incident → IoCs/CTI/TTPs → DE.CM.
