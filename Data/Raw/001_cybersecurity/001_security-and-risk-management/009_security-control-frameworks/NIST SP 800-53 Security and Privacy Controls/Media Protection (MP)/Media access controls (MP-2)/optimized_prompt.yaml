active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between strict media access controls (per NIST MP-2) and employee productivity
    in a hybrid work environment. Provide examples of digital vs. non-digital media risks, such as lost USB drives vs. misplaced
    paper documents containing CUI.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Only digital media needs controls' ignoring
      non-digital; 'No logging required' vs. best practice; 'RBAC not applicable' vs. integration).
    - 'Distractors: 1 partial truth (e.g., lists digital only), 1 opposite (e.g., no restrictions), 1 unrelated (e.g., confuses
      with encryption only).'
    - Ensure 20-30% basic Q&A, 70-80% MCQ for active recall.
    - 'Coverage: Even distribution across 6 Bloom''s levels and 4 layers; 5-10 cards per layer.'
    total_flashcards: Generate 40 flashcards (balanced by level/layer)
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST SP 800-53. Generate
  40 high-quality flashcards on ''Media Access Controls (MP-2)'' in the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk
  Management > Security Control Frameworks > NIST SP 800-53 > Media Protection (MP) > Media Access Controls (MP-2).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use for context in explanations (e.g., reference debate scenarios in cards).

  - Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL LAYERS FROM ABOVE] – Tag each card with layer.

  - Prior knowledge link: Builds on AC family (least privilege, RBAC).

  - Best Practices (NIST MP-2 Rev. 5): Restrict access to authorized users/roles; least privilege; log/review access; enhancements
  (encrypt, controlled areas, sanitization, labeling, inventory).

  - Big Picture: Prevents breaches from lost/stolen media; NIST compliance.


  Follow this exact schema for output as JSON array of flashcards:

  [{"type": "mcq" or "basic_qa", "front": "...", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "blooms_level": "...", "scaffolding_layer":
  "...", "source": "..."}}, ...]


  Adhere to flashcard schema and distractor protocol strictly. Ensure progressive difficulty (Layer 1 low Bloom''s to Layer
  4 high). Make explanations educational, tying to real-world (e.g., USB breaches). No duplicates; comprehensive coverage.'
