      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Central management aligns with the RMF because it provides a consistent, organized method for implementing and overseeing controls across an organization, which is crucial for effective risk management and continuous monitoring.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly disconnect central management from the RMF, misrepresent the RMF's stance on control management, or suggest central management bypasses core RMF activities like risk assessment.",
        "analogy": "The RMF is the overall strategic plan for managing risk, and central management is like a key operational department (e.g., supply chain) that executes specific parts of that plan efficiently across the organization."
