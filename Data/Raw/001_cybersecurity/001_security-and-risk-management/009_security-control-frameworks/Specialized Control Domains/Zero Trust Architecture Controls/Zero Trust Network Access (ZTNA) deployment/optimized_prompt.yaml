active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios would an organization prefer ZTNA over traditional VPNs, and what are the potential
    drawbacks of migrating to ZTNA? Use real-world examples like remote work during a pandemic or cloud migration to debate
    pros, cons, and implementation challenges.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''ZTNA grants full
    network access like VPN''); 2) Partial truths (e.g., mix up PDP/PEP roles); 3) Related but incorrect concepts (e.g., perimeter
    security principles); 4) Voter-noted errors (e.g., ZTNA as direct VPN replacement). Ensure distractors are realistic to
    test deep understanding.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Zero Trust Network Access
  (ZTNA) deployment (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Control Frameworks > Specialized
  Control Domains > Zero Trust Architecture Controls > ZTNA deployment).


  Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities, scaffolding layers (4 progressive layers), and flashcard
  schema to generate high-quality, pedagogically optimized flashcards. Integrate university-style elements: Bloom''s Taxonomy
  progression, active learning ties (e.g., reference discussion/peer activities), scaffolding from foundation to integration,
  and formative assessments (MCQs with feedback, scenarios).


  Incorporate research context: NIST SP 800-207 (ZTA principles, deployment models), NIST SP 1800-35 (PEP details, practice
  guide), comparisons to VPNs, components (PDP/PEP), phases (discovery, policy, deployment, verification), big picture (identity-centric
  shift).


  Output exactly 50 flashcards in JSON array format: [{''type'': ''MCQ|Q&A|Cloze|Scenario'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'':
  ''...''}]. Follow schema strictly: MCQs have 4 options (A-D, mark correct); all backs include explanation, Bloom''s level,
  source, reflection tie-in. Distractors per protocol. Ensure variety, no repetition, measurable mastery progression.'
