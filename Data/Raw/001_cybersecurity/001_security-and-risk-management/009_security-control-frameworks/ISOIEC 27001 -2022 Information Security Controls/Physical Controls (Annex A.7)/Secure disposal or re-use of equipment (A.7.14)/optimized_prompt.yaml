active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss real-world examples of data breaches caused by improper equipment disposal (e.g., lost laptops
    or donated devices). What misconceptions (like 'simple deletion is enough') contributed, and how does ISO/IEC 27001 A.7.14
    mitigate these risks?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate this comprehensive content (voter-approved 82.9%):

  - Core: Processes to prevent data leakage from storage media (HDD/SSD/USB/etc.) via sanitization before disposal/re-use.

  - Standards: ISO 27001 A.7.14 (verify data/software removal/overwriting); ISO 27002 guidelines; ISO 27040:2015 (media sanitization);
  NIST SP 800-88 Rev1 (Clear: overwrite; Purge: degauss/crypto-erase; Destroy: shred/destroy).

  - Steps: 1. Inventory; 2. Classify; 3. Select method; 4. Sanitize; 5. Verify; 6. Document.

  - Misconceptions: Deletion ≠ sanitization; SSDs need special methods.

  - Sources: NIST SP 800-88r1 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-88r1.pdf); ISO 27001:2022

  Use exact schema: JSON array of objects with ''front'', ''back'' (nested: correct_answer, options[array], explanation, bloom_level,
  scaffolding_layer, source_reference). Follow distractor protocol. Cover all 6 learning objectives across 4 scaffolding layers.
  Ensure progressive complexity, active recall, spaced repetition best practices. Output only valid JSON array.'
