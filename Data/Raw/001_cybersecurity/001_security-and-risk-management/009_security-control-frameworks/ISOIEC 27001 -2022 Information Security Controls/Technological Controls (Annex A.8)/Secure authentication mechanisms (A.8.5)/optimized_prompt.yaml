active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between usability and security in authentication methods
    (e.g., passwords vs. biometrics vs. hardware tokens). Use real-world examples like banking MFA or enterprise SSO to argue
    for phishing-resistant alternatives compliant with ISO/IEC 27001 A.8.5.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
