active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the tension between operational efficiency (e.g., data sharing for AI training)
    and privacy protections under ISO A.5.34 and GDPR. Use voter-suggested FIPs principles to argue for or against mandatory
    consent in B2B data flows, citing privacy risk examples from the data lifecycle.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
