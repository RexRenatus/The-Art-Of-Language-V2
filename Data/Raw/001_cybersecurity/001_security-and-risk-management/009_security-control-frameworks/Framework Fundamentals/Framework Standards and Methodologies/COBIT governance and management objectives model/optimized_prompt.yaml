active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how COBIT's governance and management objectives model could address a
    real-world IT governance failure (e.g., Equifax data breach). Identify which EDM objectives the board should have prioritized
    and why, encouraging critical thinking on risk optimization (EDM03) vs. stakeholder transparency (EDM05).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in COBIT 2019 governance and
  management objectives model (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security And Risk Management > Security Control Frameworks
  > Framework Fundamentals > Framework Standards and Methodologies > COBIT governance and management objectives model). Use
  university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, 4-layer scaffolding.


  CONTENT FOUNDATION (Complete per voter consensus):

  - Governance (EDM): EDM01 Ensured Governance Framework Setting/Maintenance, EDM02 Ensured Benefits Delivery, EDM03 Ensured
  Risk Optimization, EDM04 Ensured Resource Optimization, EDM05 Ensured Stakeholder Transparency.

  - Management: APO (13 objs, key: APO01 Framework, APO12 Risk); BAI (11, key: BAI02 Engineering, BAI06 Changes); DSS (6,
  key: DSS01 Operations, DSS05 Security); MEA (3, key: MEA01 Monitoring, MEA03 Compliance).
