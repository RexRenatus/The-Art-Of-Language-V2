  discussion_prompt: 'In small groups, debate the following: ''In what scenarios might relying solely on the "examine" method
    lead to false positives in control effectiveness, and how would incorporating "interview" and "test" methods mitigate
    this? Use examples from NIST SP 800-53A Rev. 5 and real-world breaches (e.g., misconfigured access controls). Rotate speakers
    to ensure all voices contribute, and synthesize group consensus.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Content Completeness (from NIST SP 800-53A Rev. 5)**:

  - EXAMINE: Review/inspect/analyze specifications, mechanisms, activities, individuals (static). Objects: documents, records,
  configs. Best practices: checklist reviews, observations.

  - INTERVIEW: Question individuals for insights on control implementation/operation. Objects: people/staff. Best practices:
  structured questions, corroborate responses, record notes.

  - TEST: Execute/dynamic test mechanisms/activities (e.g., vuln scans, pen tests, simulations). Objects: mechanisms (software),
  activities (processes). Best practices: scripted tests, non-disruptive where possible.

  - Context: Part of RMF assess step; produces findings for authorization. Prerequisites: NIST SP 800-53 controls, risk concepts.

  Sources: NIST SP 800-53A Rev. 5 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53Ar5.pdf).
