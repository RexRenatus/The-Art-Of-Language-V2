active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between container efficiency (shared kernel) and security
    (vs. VMs). Identify three real-world incidents of container escapes (e.g., from sources like Wiz.io or Palo Alto Unit
    42) and propose preventive measures, encouraging critical thinking on shared kernel risks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Always exactly 3 distractors. Make them plausible (e.g., confuse namespaces with cgroups, Falco with
    Sysdig features). Vary types: 1 factual error, 1 conceptual mix-up, 1 overgeneralization. Explanations must clarify subtle
    differences without spoiling the answer.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education on ''Container Escape Detection''. Use the
  provided learning_objectives, active_learning components, scaffolding_layers, and research_context to create optimized flashcards.
  Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom''s progression, active recall, spaced repetition best practices.


  **Topic Hierarchy (exact, no changes):** [''Cybersecurity'', ''008_Application Security'', ''008_006_Application Security
  Testing Tools'', ''009_Container and Cloud Security Scanning'', ''Runtime Container Security'', ''Container Escape Detection'']


  **Content Coverage (Complete per voter consensus):** Foundation (defs, isolation); Components (vectors: kernel vulns, misconfigs,
  privileged); Implementation (Falco/Sysdig deployment, syscall/behavioral analysis: anomalous syscalls, namespace breaks,
  host mounts); Integration (SIEM, ML anomalies, K8s). Sources: wiz.io, dl.acm.org, unit42.paloaltonetworks.com.


  **Output Format:** JSON array of objects, each strictly following flashcard_schema. E.g., [{''question'': ''...'', ''answer'':
  ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''REMEMBER'', ''scaffolding_layer'': 1, ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [{''text'':
  ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...''}, ...]}]


  Generate 25 flashcards: Balance 4-5 per Bloom''s level, 6-7 per layer. Questions must promote active learning (e.g., ''Apply
  Falco rules to detect...''). Distractors: Exactly 3, plausible, with explanations. Ensure prior knowledge links (containers,
  Linux basics).'
