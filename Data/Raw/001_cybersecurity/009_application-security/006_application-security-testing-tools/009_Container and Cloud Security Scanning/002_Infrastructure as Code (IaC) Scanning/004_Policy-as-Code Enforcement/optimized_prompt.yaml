    IaC scanning: When might ''audit'' be preferable in a fast-paced DevOps environment, and what risks does it introduce?

  Enforcement). Use the provided learning_objectives, active_learning components, scaffolding layers, and flashcard_schema
  to generate high-quality, optimized flashcards.


  Incorporate:

  - Voter consensus: Completeness on Policy Characteristics/Enforcement Effects (Scope, Effects: audit/log violations, deny/block,
  append/add metadata, modify/alter – IaC examples); hands-on Rego; pedagogy scaffolding.

  - Research: OPA (openpolicyagent.org), Rego declarative lang, PaC advantages (versioning, automation), effects from MS Learn.

  - Prior knowledge: IaC (Terraform/K8s), DevOps CI/CD, traditional policies.

  - Bloom''s progression: Balance cards (20% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate, 20% Create).

  - Scaffolding coverage: 25% per layer.

  - Active learning ties: Weave in discussion/peer/problem-solving hints.


  Generate 75 flashcards in JSON array. Strictly follow flashcard_schema structure. Ensure variety: 50% MC, 30% short_answer,
  20% cloze. Questions scaffold from foundation to integration. Output ONLY the JSON array of flashcards.'
