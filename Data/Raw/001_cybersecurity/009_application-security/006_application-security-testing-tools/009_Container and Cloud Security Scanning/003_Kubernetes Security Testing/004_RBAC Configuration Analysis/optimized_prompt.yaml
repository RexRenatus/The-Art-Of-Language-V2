active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, students teach-back core RBAC concepts (Role vs. Permission, RoleBinding mechanics) to each other
    using hand-drawn diagrams or kubectl describe outputs. Switch roles and provide feedback on accuracy.
  problem_solving: Given a sample Kubernetes RBAC YAML with misconfigurations (e.g., cluster-admin bound to a service account,
    wildcard get/list/watch), analyze for least privilege violations using tools like 'kubectl auth can-i', propose fixes,
    and simulate application with 'kubectl apply' in a minikube lab.

  Generate 50 high-quality Anki-style flashcards optimized for university pedagogy: Cover Bloom''s Taxonomy via these objectives:

  - REMEMBER: Define key RBAC components...

  - UNDERSTAND: Explain RBAC in Kubernetes...

  [Insert full learning_objectives array here]

  Distribute: 20% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 30% APPLY/ANALYZE, 30% EVALUATE/CREATE, 20% mixed.


  Scaffold across 4 layers:

  [Insert full scaffolding_layers array here]

  Aim for even coverage (12-13 per layer).


  Incorporate active learning hooks: Reference discussion (NIST vs K8s), peer teaching (diagrams), problem-solving (YAML analysis).


  Use research context: Core concepts (Role, Permission, etc.), NIST standards, Principle of Least Privilege, tools (kubectl
  auth can-i, Polaris, kubeaudit), misconfigs (cluster-admin, wildcards), best practices (least privilege, zero-trust).

  Big picture: Prevents escalation in cloud-native AppSec.


  Follow exact flashcard_schema:
