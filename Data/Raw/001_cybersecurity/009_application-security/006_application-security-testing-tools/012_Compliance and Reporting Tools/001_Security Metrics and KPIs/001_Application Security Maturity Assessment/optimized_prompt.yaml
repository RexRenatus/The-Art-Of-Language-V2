active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the differences between a one-time vulnerability scan (from subdomain 008_006
    Application Security Testing Tools) and an ongoing Application Security Maturity Assessment. How does maturity assessment
    provide strategic value for compliance reporting? Provide examples from OWASP SAMM or BSIMM.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
