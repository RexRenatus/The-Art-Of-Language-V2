active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Using NIST SP 800-53 AU controls, debate whether comprehensive security testing audit trails enhance
    or hinder organizational agility in responding to vulnerabilities. Provide real-world examples from PCI-DSS audits or
    breach investigations like the Equifax incident.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 1 semantically similar but incorrect (e.g., confuse AU-2 with AU-6).

    - 1 common misconception (e.g., ''Audit trails are optional for pen tests'').

    - 1 unrelated but tempting (e.g., from another NIST family like AC). Ensure distractors test nuance from standards.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Application Security Testing
  Tools (Domain: 008_Application Security, Subdomain: 008_006_Application Security Testing Tools; Entry: 010_012_Compliance

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (15 Basic, 15 Cloze, 20 MCQ) optimized for Anki/Quizlet, covering these LEARNING OBJECTIVES:

  [Insert full learning_objectives array here].


  Incorporate SCAFFOLDING layers progressively (Layer 1: 20% cards, Layer 2: 25%, Layer 3: 30%, Layer 4: 25%). Embed ACTIVE
  LEARNING elements: Reference discussion trade-offs, peer analogies (e.g., ''digital video recorder''), problem-solving scenarios
  (pen test reconstruction).


  Core Content (NIST SP 800-53 AU Family, completed):

  - AU-2: Audit Events – Identify/define events (e.g., login, privilege use, security testing actions).

  - AU-3: Content of Audit Records – Include user ID, event type, timestamp, success/fail, source/dest, data affected.

  - AU-6: Audit Record Review, Analysis, Reporting – Review/review frequency, anomaly detection, reports/ alerts (e.g., real-time
  for pen tests).

  - AU-11: Retention – Define periods (e.g., 1 year min for compliance).

  - AU-12: Audit Record Generation – Timely, protected from unauthorized modification/deletion (integrity, non-repudiation
  via crypto hashing/signatures).

  Link to PCI-DSS Req 10 (log/review critical events). Real-world: Equifax breach lacked full trails.
