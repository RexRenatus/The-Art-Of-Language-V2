active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'Debate in groups: Should a company deploying an AI-driven employee performance monitoring system conduct
    a DPIA? Argue based on GDPR high-risk criteria (e.g., automated profiling with significant effects), using real examples
    like Amazon''s hiring algorithm controversies. Provide counterarguments for why it might not qualify and address misconceptions
    that DPIAs are only for large-scale data breaches.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in GDPR Data Protection Assessment
  (DPIA). Use the provided topic hierarchy (Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 008_006_Application Security Testing
  Tools > 010_012_Compliance and Reporting Tools > Regulatory Compliance Testing > GDPR Data Protection Assessment) and research
  context (DPIA as GDPR Art. 35 risk tool for high-risk processing like profiling/special data; by design/default; accountability;
  sources: ico.org.uk, edps.europa.eu, riskdatacontrol.com).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Active learning: Inspire cards from discussion (AI monitoring debate), peer teaching (DPIA steps), problem-solving (fitness
  app scenario).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute content across 4 layers [insert summaries above]; tag each card with layer.


  Generate flashcards following this schema exactly [insert schema above]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 50 flashcards. Ensure
  progression: early cards REMEMBER foundation, later CREATE integration. Make explanations educational, referencing voters''
  consensus (e.g., step-by-step process, EDPS role). Cards must be optimized for spaced repetition (concise Q/A, rich explanations).'
