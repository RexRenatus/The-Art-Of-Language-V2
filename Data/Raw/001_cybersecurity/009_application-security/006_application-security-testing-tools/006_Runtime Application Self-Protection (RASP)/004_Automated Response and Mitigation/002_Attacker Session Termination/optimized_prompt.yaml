active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of short vs. long session timeouts in a banking app (e.g., 5 min vs. 30 min). Consider
    security risks like session hijacking and user experience. Provide evidence from OWASP Session Management Cheat Sheet
    guidelines. Address misconceptions about usability overriding security.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: '1. Generate exactly 3 distractors per card. 2. Make them plausible: e.g., swap concepts (hijacking
    vs fixation), use partial truths (client-side timeout), or real-world errors (ignore server validation). 3. Avoid obvious
    wrongs; base on voter-noted misconceptions (usability vs security). 4. Ensure no distractor is correct.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Application Security and
  RASP. Generate exactly 20 high-quality flashcards on ''Attacker Session Termination'' (Topic Hierarchy: {Level 1: Cybersecurity,
  Level 2: 008_Application Security, Level 3: 008_006_Application Security Testing Tools, Level 4: 006_Runtime Application
  Self-Protection (RASP), Level 5: Automated Response and Mitigation, Level 6: Attacker Session Termination}).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full array from above].

  - Active Learning: Use discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving as question inspirations.

  - Scaffolding: Ensure coverage across 4 layers (cite layers in explanations).

  - Research: Definitions (session hijacking, fixation, timeout, logout), OWASP WSTG-SESS-06/07, Session Management Cheat
  Sheet (full links in scaffolding).


  Output a JSON array of 20 flashcards, each strictly following this schema: {question: string, bloom_level: ''REMEMBER|UNDERSTAND|APPLY|ANALYZE|EVALUATE|CREATE'',
  correct_answer: string, distractors: [string, string, string], explanation: string, references: [string,...], topic_hierarchy:
  {level1: ''Cybersecurity'', ...}}.


  Rules:

  - Distribute: 3-4 cards per Bloom''s level.

  - Questions: University-level, active recall (e.g., ''Apply: Write pseudocode for...'').

  - Distractors: EXACTLY 3, plausible via protocol [paste distractor_protocol].

  - Explanations: 2-4 sentences, tie to objectives/scaffolding/active learning/OWASP, correct misconceptions.

  - No duplicates; vary formats (MCQ implied via distractors).

  - Ensure voter consensus: Pedagogy progression, completeness (full sources), schema compliance.'
