active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, diagram the architecture of an Application-Embedded RASP Agent (including monitoring points and
    threat response flows) using tools like draw.io, then conduct a 2-minute teach-back to another pair, incorporating examples
    from commercial tools like Check Point CloudGuard RASP or Imperva RASP.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A legacy Java web app faces SQL injection risks. Design a step-by-step RASP deployment strategy,
    simulate threat detection/blocking, and justify choices (e.g., agent placement). Role-play as attacker vs. RASP defender
    to test the design.'

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ types (30% of cards): Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g.,
    ''RASP operates at network perimeter'' vs. true ''embedded in app runtime''; confuse with WAF false positives; mix up
    zero-day handling). Ensure distractors are realistic from research context or voter-noted pitfalls like performance overhead
    myths.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Application-Embedded
  RASP Agents'' in Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 008_006_Application Security Testing Tools > 006_Runtime Application
  Self-Protection (RASP) > RASP Deployment and Architecture > Application-Embedded RASP Agents.


  Incorporate these elements:

  - LEARNING OBJECTIVES: [paste the full array from learning_objectives]. Distribute flashcards across levels (10% Remember,
  20% Understand, 25% Apply, 20% Analyze, 15% Evaluate, 10% Create).

  - SCAFFOLDING: [paste the full array from scaffolding]. Allocate ~25% cards per layer.

  - ACTIVE LEARNING: [paste the full object from active_learning]. Link 20% of cards to these (e.g., ''Use in peer teaching
  diagram'').

  - KEY CONTENT: RASP agents embed in app runtime for real-time threat detection/blocking via internal visibility (inputs/outputs/state).
  Differs from WAFs (network-based). Benefits: Contextual awareness, zero-day protection, low overhead, reduced false positives.
  Examples: Check Point CloudGuard, Imperva. Prior: WAF/OWASP. Big Picture: Shift-left runtime defense.

  - PRIORITIZE: Voter consensus (82.9% approval): Full benefits list, tool examples, comparisons.


  Use FLASHCARD SCHEMA: [paste the full object from flashcard_schema]. Vary types (40% basic, 30% cloze, 30% MCQ). Ensure
  web-grounded (e.g., cite checkpoint.com). Output ONLY a valid JSON array of 50 flashcards, no extra text.'
