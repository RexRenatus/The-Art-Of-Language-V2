active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between aggressively reducing false positives (e.g., via rule tuning and whitelisting)
    and the increased risk of false negatives in SAST tools for a startup with limited security staff. Use real-world examples
    from causes like outdated signatures or misconfigurations, and impacts like alert fatigue. Reference broader AppSec pipeline
    efficiency and DevSecOps maturity.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Related but irrelevant concept (e.g., DAST instead of SAST); 3) Partial truth exaggerated (e.g., ''always use ML''
    ignoring trade-offs). Ensure distractors test nuance (e.g., impacts of FP vs. FN). Base on research causes/strategies.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert cybersecurity educator and flashcard generator specializing in Application Security. Generate
  50 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''False Positive Reduction'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security
  > 008_006_Application Security Testing Tools > Static 008_006_Application Security Testing (SAST) > Results Management and
  Accuracy > False Positive Reduction). Use provided research: FP (benign flagged as threat), FN (threat missed), causes (outdated
  signatures, misconfigs, algo limits, incomplete intel), impacts (alert fatigue, waste), strategies (rule tuning, whitelisting,
  manual review, dev feedback, ML, threat intel).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Scaffolding: 4 layers [insert summaries]. Ensure even coverage (12-13 cards/layer).

  - Active learning: Tie cards to discussion (trade-offs), peer teaching (strategies), problem-solving (triage samples).

  - Prior knowledge: Link to SAST basics.

  - Big picture: DevSecOps, CI/CD.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 50 flashcards matching EXACT schema: {id, type, bloom_level, scaffolding_layer, question, answer,
  options (null if non-MCQ), explanation}. 40% MCQ (distractors per protocol), 20% definition, 20% apply (scenarios), 20%
  analyze/evaluate/create. Questions progressively scaffolded. Varied phrasing for active recall. Ensure university-level
  rigor, no spoilers in questions.'
