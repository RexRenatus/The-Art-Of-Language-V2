active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a DevSecOps team using multiple SAST tools (e.g., SonarQube, Semgrep, CodeQL), debate the pros and
    cons of adopting SARIF for results aggregation. How does it impact developer workflow, false positive management, and
    compliance reporting? Consider trade-offs between interoperability and tool-specific features.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Tool confusion (SonarQube native format); 3) Partial truths (e.g., ''OASIS XML standard''); 4) Edge cases (v1.0 vs
    v2.1.0). Ensure 40% MCQ with 4 options (1 correct, 3 distractors), balance across Bloom''s/scaffolding.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Application Security Testing
  Tools. Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on ''Static Analysis Results Interchange Format (SARIF)'' strictly following
  the provided schema, learning objectives, active learning components, and 4-layer scaffolding. Use EXACT topic hierarchy:
  [''Cybersecurity'', ''008_Application Security'', ''008_006_Application Security Testing Tools'', ''Static 008_006_Application
  Security Testing (SAST)'', ''Results Management and Accuracy'', ''Static Analysis Results Interchange Format (SARIF)''].
  Incorporate research: SARIF v2.1.0 OASIS JSON standard for SAST interoperability (docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0).
  Key features: Standardized schema (runs/results/artifacts/rule), JSON parseability, tool extensibility, DevOps collaboration
  (aggregate SonarQube/Semgrep/CodeQL), false positive reduction, CI/CD integration.


  Prior knowledge: SAST basics, JSON, CI/CD. Big picture: Enables AppSec compliance (OWASP/NIST).


  Distribute: 4-5 flashcards per Bloom''s objective/layer. Variety: 40% MCQ (distractors per protocol), 30% short_answer/cloze
  (fill schema fields), 20% true_false, 10% scenario-based. Each card: active recall front, full schema back. Link explanations
  to pedagogy (e.g., ''Applies Layer 3: Parse with Python json''). Output JSON array of flashcard objects matching schema.
  No extra text.'
