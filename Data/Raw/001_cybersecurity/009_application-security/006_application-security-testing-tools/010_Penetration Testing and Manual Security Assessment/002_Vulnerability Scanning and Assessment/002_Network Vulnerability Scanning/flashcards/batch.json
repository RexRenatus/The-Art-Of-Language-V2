        "core_logic": "Control enhancement SA-15(13) within NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 specifies that the organization must define the process and frequency for vulnerability scanning, because this customization ensures scans align with the organization's specific risk profile and operational needs.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly associate SA-15(13) with mandating specific software, encrypting results, or setting penetration testing frequencies, rather than defining the process and cadence of vulnerability scanning itself.",
        "analogy": "SA-15(13) is like a recipe instruction that says 'define the cooking time and temperature based on your oven,' rather than specifying 'bake at 350°F for 30 minutes' for all ovens."
