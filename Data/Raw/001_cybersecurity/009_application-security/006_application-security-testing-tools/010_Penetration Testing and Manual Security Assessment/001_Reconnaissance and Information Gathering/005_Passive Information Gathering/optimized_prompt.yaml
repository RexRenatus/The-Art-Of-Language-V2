active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, research and teach one OSINT tool to the class (e.g., one pair on Maltego for visualization, another
    on theHarvester for email harvesting). Include a demo, pros/cons, and Q&A to reinforce understanding.
  problem_solving: Assign a fictional company (e.g., 'TechCorp Inc.'); students must gather passive intel using only public
    sources (Google Dorks, WHOIS, Shodan, social media) to profile infrastructure, employees, and leaks—without direct interaction.
    Present findings in a report and discuss potential next steps in active recon.

    but incomplete (e.g., ''Only uses Google'' ignoring other sources); 3) Edge cases (e.g., tools that blur passive/active
    lines like Nmap without -sL). Ensure 60% basic Q/A, 40% MCQ. Cover all Bloom''s levels and scaffolding layers proportionally.'
