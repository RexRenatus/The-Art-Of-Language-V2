active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare white-box penetration testing with black-box and grey-box approaches. In what scenarios would
    white-box testing reveal vulnerabilities missed by others (e.g., code-level business logic flaws in OWASP Top 10)? Debate
    the trade-offs in terms of time, cost, and depth using real-world examples like insecure deserialization in a banking
    app. Address the misconception that white-box is merely 'code review.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''White-box requires no source code''),
    2) Related but incorrect concept (e.g., mix black-box traits), 3) Partial truth (e.g., benefit overstated). Ensure 70%
    coverage of objectives/layers; balance Q types (40% MCQ, 30% cloze, 30% short answer). Aim for 50-100 flashcards total.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in White-Box Penetration Testing\
  \ (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 008_006_Application Security Testing Tools > 010_Penetration\
