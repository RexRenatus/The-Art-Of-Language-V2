active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between speed and security in password hashing algorithms like bcrypt vs. SHA-256.
    Under what scenarios would you choose one over the other, considering real-world breaches like LinkedIn 2012? Support
    your arguments with NIST SP 800-63B recommendations and tool performance data from Hashcat benchmarks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    1 partial truth (e.g., ''SHA-256 with salt is sufficient''), 1 unrelated/off-topic (e.g., ''Encryption key length'').
    Ensure distractors are web-grounded (e.g., from OWASP/NIST errors) and teach via explanation.'

  FULL RESEARCH SUMMARY HERE, INCLUDING CORE CONCEPTS, NIST SP 800-63B (use salt+iterations: PBKDF2>=100k, bcrypt, scrypt,
  Argon2id preferred; avoid fast hashes), tools (Hashcat: GPU brute-force/dictionary/rainbow/mask; John the Ripper: community-enhanced),
  techniques (brute-force, dictionary, hybrid, rainbow tables), OWASP prevention]. Emphasize ethical use in labs only.
