active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the balance between effective XSS payload generation for authorized penetration testing and the
    risk of enabling malicious actors. What safeguards (e.g., access controls, logging) should tool developers implement?
    Consider legal implications and responsible disclosure.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., ''blocks XSS'' vs. ''tests XSS''), 2) Mix contexts (e.g., HTML payload for JS), 3) Ignore ethics (e.g., ''for malicious
    hacking''), 4) Real-world misapps (e.g., ''PCI-DSS compliance tool'' vs. ''testing tool''). Ensure distractors teach by
    contrast.'

  Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 008_006_Application Security Testing Tools > 010_Penetration Testing > 005_Exploitation
  Frameworks > XSS Payload Generators). Synthesize 75 high-quality flashcards using university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy
  objectives [insert learning_objectives array here], active learning [insert active_learning here], 4 scaffolding layers
  [insert scaffolding_layers here]. Emphasize ethical hacking: all content for authorized pentesting only, include responsible
  disclosure, legal warnings. Prerequisites: HTML/JS, OWASP XSS.


  Incorporate research: XSS payloads for contexts (HTML/JS/URL/etc.), WAF bypasses (encoding/obfuscation), tools (XSStrike),
  pentest lifecycle, bug bounties.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards matching this schema [insert flashcard_schema.structure here]. Balance: Layers 1-4
  (25% each), Bloom''s progression. Distractors per protocol [insert distractor_protocol]. Every explanation per requirements
  [insert explanation_requirements]. No payloads executable outside labs; use placeholders like ''<script>alert(1)</script>''
  with warnings.'
