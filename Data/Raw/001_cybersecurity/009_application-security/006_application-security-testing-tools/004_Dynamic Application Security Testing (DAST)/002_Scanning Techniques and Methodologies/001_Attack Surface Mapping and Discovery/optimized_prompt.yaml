active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a company with a limited security budget, should they prioritize mapping external or internal attack
    surfaces first? Debate using real-world breach examples like SolarWinds (internal supply chain compromise) or Capital
    One (external cloud misconfiguration), considering factors like threat actor focus, false positives in DAST, and resource
    allocation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs: 4 options total (1 correct, 3 distractors).

    - Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., confuse attack surface with vulnerability).

    - Distractor 2: Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., list only external digital assets).

    - Distractor 3: Plausible but incorrect tool/example (e.g., use SAST tool like SonarQube for DAST task).

    Ensure distractors are realistic, web-grounded (from research like Shodan vs. internal tools), and promote analysis (e.g.,
    external vs. internal mix-up). Balance coverage: 30% Layer 1-2 (recall/understand), 40% Layer 3 (apply), 30% Layer 4 (analyze/evaluate/create).'

  Active Learning: Use for context in explanations.

  Flashcard Schema: [Copy full schema from above].


  Generate exactly 25 flashcards covering all objectives/layers/tools (e.g., Nuclei, ffuf, Amass, Shodan, Censys, OWASP ZAP,
  Burp Suite; best practices like continuous monitoring/CI/CD). Ensure 70% MCQ with distractors per protocol. Balance Bloom''s
  levels. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects, no extra text.'
