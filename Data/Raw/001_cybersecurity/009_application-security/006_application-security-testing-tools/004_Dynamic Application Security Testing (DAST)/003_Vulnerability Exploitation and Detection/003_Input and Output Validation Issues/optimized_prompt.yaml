active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of allowlisting versus blocklisting for input validation.
    Use real-world examples from OWASP (e.g., preventing SQL Injection) and consider how DAST tools like Burp Suite or ZAP
    would detect failures in each approach. Synthesize a consensus recommendation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs: 3 distractors that are plausible misconceptions (e.g., ''Blacklisting is preferred'' as
    distractor for allowlisting question; ''Client-side only validation suffices'' for server-side emphasis; truncated/incomplete
    strategies like ''Syntactic only, skip semantic''). Base on common errors from OWASP (e.g., ignoring context in encoding)
    or DAST pitfalls (e.g., ''Burp only for static analysis''). Ensure 1 best/correct, others subtly wrong.'

  008_Application Security > 008_006_Application Security Testing Tools > Dynamic 008_006_Application Security Testing (DAST)

  pedagogy (Bloom''s, scaffolding), completeness (allowlisting vs blocklisting, output encoding, OWASP, DAST tools like Burp/ZAP).


  Incorporate this research context: Input validation ensures properly formatted data (syntactic: format via regex; semantic:
  logic checks); goals: prevent malformed data/attacks (XSS/SQLi); strategies: allowlisting (whitelist known good, OWASP preferred)
  > blocklisting; output encoding: context-aware (HTML: htmlspecialchars; URL: urlencode; prevent XSS); perform server-side
  early; DAST: Burp/ZAP fuzzing for bypasses/exploitation. Sources: OWASP Input Validation Cheat Sheet, Output Encoding Cheat
  Sheet, ESAPI.
