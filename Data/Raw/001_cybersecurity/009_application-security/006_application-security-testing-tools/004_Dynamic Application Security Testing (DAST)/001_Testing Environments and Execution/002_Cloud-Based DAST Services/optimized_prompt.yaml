active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast cloud-based DAST services with on-premises DAST tools in a debate format. Argue
    for scenarios where one is preferable over the other, considering factors like scalability, cost, compliance (e.g., OWASP
    Top 10 mitigation), and integration with CI/CD pipelines. Support arguments with real-world examples such as Veracode
    or Checkmarx.
  peer_teaching: 'Think-Pair-Share: Pair up with a partner. One student explains core DAST concepts (black-box testing, vulnerability
    detection like XSS/SQLi) using simple analogies (e.g., ''like a burglar testing locks without seeing the blueprint''),
    then switches to explain cloud-based advantages (scalability, no infrastructure setup). Partners teach back and correct
    misconceptions, such as confusing DAST (dynamic, runtime) with SAST (static, source code).'
  problem_solving: 'Real-world scenario: Your team deploys a web application to AWS. Design a testing plan using a cloud-based
    DAST service (e.g., Synopsys or Veracode) to simulate OWASP Top 10 attacks. Identify 3 potential vulnerabilities, outline
    execution steps in cloud environments, and propose mitigation strategies. Groups present findings and discuss integration
    challenges.'

  Voter Consensus (84.3% approval): Emphasize completeness (examples: Veracode, Synopsys, Checkmarx; NIST SP 800-115), pedagogy
  (Bloom''s progression), scaffolding (4 layers), active learning, OWASP Top 10.


  Use this structure to generate 25 high-quality flashcards:


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the learning_objectives array here]


  **Active Learning Context:** Incorporate elements from discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving to inspire scenario questions.


  **Scaffolding Coverage:** Distribute flashcards: 6 L1 Foundation, 7 L2 Components, 6 L3 Implementation, 6 L4 Integration.
  Tag each: [BLOOM-LAYER].


  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly follow [front/back structure]. Use distractor protocol for MCQs. Explanations must reference
  standards (OWASP DevSecOps, NIST SP 800-115) and build on black-box testing prior knowledge.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'', ''opt3''], ''references'': [''OWASP'']}, ''bloom_layer'': ''REMEMBER-L1''}]. Ensure
  active recall, no hints on front, optimized for spaced repetition.'
