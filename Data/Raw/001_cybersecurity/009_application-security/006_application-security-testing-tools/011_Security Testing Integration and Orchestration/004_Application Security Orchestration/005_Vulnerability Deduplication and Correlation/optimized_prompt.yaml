  Core Content: Vulnerability = weakness exploitable by threat. Mgmt = identify/prioritize/remediate. Dedup = merge duplicates
  (hash/CWE). Correlation = link for risks (attack paths). Tools: DefectDojo, ZAP/Nessus. Standards: NIST CSF/SP 800-40 (Identify/Detect),
  OWASP. Prior knowledge: SAST/DAST scanning.
