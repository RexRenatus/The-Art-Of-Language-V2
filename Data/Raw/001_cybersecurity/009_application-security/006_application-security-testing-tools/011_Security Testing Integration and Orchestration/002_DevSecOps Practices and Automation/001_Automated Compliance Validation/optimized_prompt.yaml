active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs of automating compliance validation with NIST CSF versus OWASP ASVS in a high-velocity
    DevSecOps environment—what risks are mitigated (e.g., continuous monitoring), and what new challenges arise (e.g., policy
    drift or false positives)? Support your arguments with tool examples like OPA or Checkov.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Common pitfalls (e.g., ''manual auditing'' vs ''policy-as-code''); 3) Tool confusions (e.g., ''Jenkins'' as scanner vs
    orchestrator); 4) Partial truths (e.g., ''OWASP ZAP for compliance'' – it''s DAST). Ensure 70% high-plausibility to challenge

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom''s Taxonomy, active
  learning, and scaffolding. Generate 40 high-quality flashcards on ''Automated Compliance Validation'' (Topic Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 008_006_Application Security Testing Tools > 011_Security Testing Integration
  and Orchestration > DevSecOps Practices and Automation > Automated Compliance Validation). Builds on SAST/DAST prerequisites.


  Incorporate:

  - Research: Automated validation uses policy-as-code (OPA, Checkov) for standards like NIST CSF (risk management), ISO/IEC
  27034 (app sec processes), OWASP ASVS, NIST SP 800-53, CIS Benchmarks, PCI DSS. Tools: OPA/Kyverno, SonarQube, OpenSCAP,
  Ansible, Chef InSpec, Jenkins/GitLab CI integrations.

  - Voters (82.9% approval): Tools/examples, complete ISO 27034, active prompts, SMART objectives.


  Use these EXACT learning objectives, active learning activities, scaffolding layers, and flashcard schema provided in the
  JSON input.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 40 flashcards, each matching the schema precisely (front/back with all fields). Ensure variety:
  12 REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND (Layer 1 heavy), 12 APPLY/ANALYZE (Layer 2-3), 16 EVALUATE/CREATE (Layer 4). Distractors per protocol.
  Explanations reference objectives/activities/research for deep learning. Promote spaced repetition with precise, testable
  Qs.'
