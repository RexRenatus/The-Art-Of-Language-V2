active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages and limitations of CycloneDX's extensible object model compared
    to SPDX for managing diverse BOM types (SBOM, HBOM, CBOM) in enterprise supply chains. Provide evidence from official
    documentation and real-world adoption examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
