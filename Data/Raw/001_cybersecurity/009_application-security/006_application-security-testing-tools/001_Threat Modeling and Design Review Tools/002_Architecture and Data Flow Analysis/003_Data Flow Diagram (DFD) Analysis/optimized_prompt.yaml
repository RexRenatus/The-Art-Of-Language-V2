  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the role of DFDs in the application security lifecycle: How do they bridge
    design review (entry domain: Threat Modeling and Design Review Tools) to testing tools? Use real-world examples like the
    Equifax breach to argue if DFDs could have prevented data exposure. Cite benefits from NIST SP 800-53 or OWASP.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards optimized for spaced repetition and Bloom''s Taxonomy mastery. Use the provided:

  - LEARNING OBJECTIVES: [insert array above]

  - SCAFFOLDING LAYERS: [insert scaffolding above]

  - ACTIVE LEARNING: [insert active learning above]

  - FLASHCARD SCHEMA: [insert schema above]


  Incorporate:

  - Voter consensus (100% approval): Completeness (CMMC/NIST/STRIDE/OWASP), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression, 4-layer scaffold),
  prior links (threat modeling), big picture (app sec lifecycle), concept map (DFD central → elements → frameworks), visuals/misconceptions
  (DFD vs. ERD/control flows).

  - Web research: Core elements (processes/stores/entities/flows), benefits (proactive risks, incident response), sources
  (paloaltonetworks.com, rightofboom.com, madsecurity.com).
