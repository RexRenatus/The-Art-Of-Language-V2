  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Zero Trust Architecture renders traditional Defense in
    Depth obsolete.'' Use evidence from NIST SP 800-207 and real-world examples to support your position, considering integration
    with Threat Modeling.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    ''Perimeter security'' for ZTA), 2) Confused terms (e.g., ''Defense in Depth'' as single-layer), 3) Partial truths (e.g.,
    ''Least Privilege grants full admin access initially''). Ensure distractors promote analysis of differences.'

  knowledge: Automated Threat Identification informs pattern selection.


  **Research Context (Completed):** Core Concepts: Application Security (protect apps lifecycle); Secure Design Patterns (reusable
  blueprints, e.g., input validation, secure authentication like OAuth); Threat Modeling (identify threats); Defense in Depth
  (multi-layers); Least Privilege (minimal perms); ZTA (no implicit trust, NIST SP 800-207). Frameworks: NIST SSDF (secure
  dev practices); NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover). Sources: NIST SP 800-207 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/207/r1/final),
  NIST SSDF SP 800-218 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/218/final), OWASP Secure Design Cheat Sheet (https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html),
  NIST CSF (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework).


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Use these Learning Objectives [insert list above]. Incorporate Active Learning [insert summaries].
  Follow Scaffolding Layers [insert descriptions].


  **Task:** Generate 50 high-quality flashcards per Flashcard Schema [insert schema]. Ensure university-style: Bloom''s progression,
  active recall, misconceptions via distractors. Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'',
  ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''related_concepts'': ''...'', ''active_learning_tie_in'': ''...''}},
