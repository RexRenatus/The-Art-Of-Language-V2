      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The iterative and flexible nature of PASTA is advantageous because it enables continuous improvement and adaptation to evolving systems and threats, ensuring the threat model remains relevant and effective over time. This adaptability functions by allowing cycles of refinement based on new information.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors present unrealistic expectations about completeness, collaboration, and the role of business context, which are contrary to the principles of an iterative and flexible methodology like PASTA.",
        "analogy": "An iterative approach is like refining a recipe over time; you might start with a basic version, test it, get feedback, and make adjustments to improve the final dish, rather than expecting perfection on the first try."
