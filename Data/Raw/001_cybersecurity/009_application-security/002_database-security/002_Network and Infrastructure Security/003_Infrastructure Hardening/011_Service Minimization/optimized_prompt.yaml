  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the trade-offs of service minimization in a database-backed web app: Which services (e.g., remote
    MySQL access, debug endpoints, unused PostgreSQL extensions) should be disabled versus maintaining necessary functionality?
    Consider usability, compliance, and zero trust principles.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom''s Taxonomy, active
  recall, and spaced repetition. Generate 30 high-quality flashcards (10 per Bloom''s pair: Remember/Understand, Apply/Analyze,
  Evaluate/Create) on the topic ''Service Minimization'' (Category: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 012_Database
  Security; Entry: 004_Network and Infrastructure Security > Infrastructure Hardening).


  **Topic Context (Synthesized from NIST CSF, voter consensus, web research):** Service minimization reduces attack surface
  by disabling unnecessary services in apps/DBs (e.g., unused PostgreSQL extensions, MySQL remote access, RDP). Aligns with
  least privilege/defense in depth. NIST CSF: Identify (inventory services), Protect (disable extras). Examples: Disable pg_hstore
  in Postgres if unused; firewall DB ports. Complete NIST SP 800-63 tie-in: Minimizes auth services for digital identity.

  **Active Learning Integration:** Tag each flashcard with a link to activities for classroom use. [Insert active_learning
  object here].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** Distribute flashcards: 8 Layer 1, 8 Layer 2, 7 Layer 3, 7 Layer 4. [Insert scaffolding object here].


  **Flashcard Generation Rules:**

  - Varied types: 40% QA, 40% MCQ, 20% cloze.

  - Ensure active recall: Front hides answer.

  - Distractors: Follow protocol for misconceptions (e.g., ''least privilege is only for users'').

  - Explanations: 100-200 words, reference objectives/layers/NIST/DB examples/breaches (Equifax).

  - Optimize for Anki: Concise fronts, rich backs.

  - Topic Hierarchy: Prefix questions with context (e.g., ''In Database Security...'').


  **Output Format:** Strictly JSON array of 30 flashcards matching the schema: [Insert flashcard_schema.structure example].
  No extra text.'
