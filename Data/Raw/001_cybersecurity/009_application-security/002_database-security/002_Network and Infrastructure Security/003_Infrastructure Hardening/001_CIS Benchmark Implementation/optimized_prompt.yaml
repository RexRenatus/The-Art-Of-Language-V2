    vs. 'automated with CIS-CAT'). 3. Related but incorrect (e.g., NIST vs. CIS mappings). 4. Out-of-scope (e.g., cloud-only
    tools). Ensure 70% coverage across scaffolding layers.

  **Topic Content (Completed Research Context):**

  CIS Benchmarks: Free, consensus-driven secure configs for IT systems (e.g., databases like MySQL). CIS Controls v8: Prioritized
  safeguards against attacks, mapped to NIST SP 800-53, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR. CIS-CAT Pro: Automates assessments. CAS: Measurement
  specs. Hardened Images: Pre-secured OS. Database focus: Harden auth, auditing, encryption. Big picture: Defense-in-depth
  for secure data layer.
