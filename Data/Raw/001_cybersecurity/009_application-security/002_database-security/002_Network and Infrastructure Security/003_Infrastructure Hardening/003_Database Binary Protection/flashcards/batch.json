        "core_logic": "Containerization allows database binaries and their dependencies to be packaged into immutable images. This isolation simplifies protection, as changes can be detected by comparing against the known-good image. Updates involve replacing the entire container with a new, patched image, which aids in maintaining binary integrity.",
