  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the full array from ''learning_objectives'']

  - Active Learning: Use elements like problem-solving scenarios (e.g., Azure SQL migration) to inspire scenario-based cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [paste full scaffolding details].

  - Prerequisites: Link to Infrastructure Hardening (hardening basics).

  - Research Context: Baselines for Windows (11/10/Server 2022/2019/2016), Azure, M365 Apps, Edge. Purpose: Standardized configs
  from MS teams; align CIS/NIST/PCI. Implementation: Download, GPMC/Intune/SCCM, validate. Connect to Database Sec (SQL Server
  via Windows baselines, Azure SQL benchmarks).

  - Concept Map: Central ''Security Baselines'' → Products/Standards/Dependencies/Interlinks.


  Use exact Flashcard Schema: [paste full schema]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 30 flashcards, each as a complete object. Ensure
  variety in Bloom''s levels (min 1 per objective), layers, and types. Distractors must follow protocol. Explanations reference
  hierarchy, sources (learn.microsoft.com), and pedagogy.'
