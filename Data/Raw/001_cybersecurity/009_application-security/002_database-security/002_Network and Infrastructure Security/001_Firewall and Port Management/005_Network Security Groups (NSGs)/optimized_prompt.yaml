active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a Zero Trust environment, debate the role of NSGs versus ASGs for securing database subnets. Provide
    examples where one is preferable (e.g., NSGs for broad subnet-level port filtering vs. ASGs for app-tier grouping), and
    discuss alignment with NIST SP 800-53 (AC-4 Information Flow Enforcement).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Edge case reversal (e.g., allow vs. deny priority); 3) Related but wrong concept (e.g., NSG vs. ASG or firewall layers).
    Ensure distractors are realistic from voter-noted inaccuracies or Azure pitfalls.'
