active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a debate format, argue whether WAFs should prioritize minimizing false positives or false negatives
    in high-traffic e-commerce sites, using OWASP Top 10 examples like SQLi and XSS. What trade-offs exist in integration
    with existing Layer 3/4 firewalls, and how does this impact PCI DSS compliance?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    mix L3/4 with L7), 2) Terminology swap (e.g., false positive vs. negative), 3) Partial truth (e.g., valid for blacklists
    but not whitelists). Ensure distractors are realistic from research context (e.g., OWASP threats) and voter priorities.
    Avoid obvious errors.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Web Application Firewall

  Generate 40-60 high-quality flashcards optimized for spaced repetition (Anki-style), covering all Bloom''s levels and scaffolding
  layers. Ensure 20% remember/understand, 30% apply/analyze, 30% evaluate, 20% create. Distribute evenly: 25% Layer 1, 25%
  Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4. Incorporate research: WAF monitors HTTP/HTTPS at L7, blocks malicious traffic (SQLi/XSS),
  false pos/neg, allow/block lists, OWASP Top 10, PCI DSS.

  Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING DESCRIPTION FROM ABOVE].

  Active Learning Tie-Ins: Reference discussion (false pos/neg trade-offs), peer teaching (L7 explanations), problem-solving
  (rule design) in explanations.


  Use EXACT Flashcard Schema: [INSERT FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, e.g., [{''front'':
  ''...'', ...}, ...]. Vary formats: 50% MCQ, 30% cloze, 20% short answer. Align with voter consensus (82.9% approval): pedagogy,
  higher Bloom''s, prior links (L3/4 vs L7), concept map coverage.'
