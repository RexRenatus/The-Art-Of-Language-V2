  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, compare AES-KW and AES-KWP modes: What are the trade-offs in terms of security
    (e.g., integrity checks), performance, and suitability for database key storage? Debate which mode is preferable for high-volume
    key wrapping in a cloud database environment and justify your choice.'

    principles: 'Misconception-based: 1. Confuse wrapping with key generation/derivation. 2. Mix with KEMs/public-key encryption.
      3. Ignore integrity (e.g., no checks in KW). 4. Wrong standards (e.g., attribute to SP 800-227 only). 5. Performance/security
      trade-offs (e.g., KWP slower but authenticated).'
    examples:
    - 'Distractor: ''Key wrapping uses public keys'' (wrong: symmetric).'
    - 'Distractor: ''AES-KW provides no integrity'' (wrong: does via checks).'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Key Wrapping Techniques\
  \ (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 012_Database Security > 004_Data Protection & 001_Cryptography\
  \ > 006_Key Management > Key Wrapping Techniques). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning components, scaffolding\
  \ layers, and flashcard schema to generate 25 high-quality flashcards.\n\nIncorporate university pedagogy: Bloom's Taxonomy\
  \ (label each), active learning hooks (e.g., 'Discuss: How does this apply to DB keys?'), scaffolding progression. Prior\
  \ knowledge: AES basics, key lifecycle.\n\nSources: NIST SP 800-38F (AES-KW/KWP), SP 800-227 (KEMs), complete references.\n\
  \nOutput ONLY in JSON array of flashcards, each as:\n{\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"type\": \"basic|mcq\",\n  \"front\": \"...\",\n\
  \  \"back\": \"...\",\n  \"bloom_level\": \"REMEMBER\",\n  \"scaffolding_layer\": 1,\n  \"reference\": \"NIST SP 800-38F\"\

  \ APPLY/ANALYZE, 30% EVALUATE/CREATE. Cover all layers equally."
