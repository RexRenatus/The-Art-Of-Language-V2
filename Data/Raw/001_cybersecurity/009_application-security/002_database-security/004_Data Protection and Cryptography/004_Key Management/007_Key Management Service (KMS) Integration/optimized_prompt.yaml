active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a multi-account AWS organization, debate the trade-offs of centralized versus decentralized KMS key
    management. Consider security risks (e.g., key exposure), compliance (NIST SP 800-57, PCI DSS), operational overhead,
    and recovery scenarios. Which model would you recommend for a financial app handling database encryption, and why? Support
    with AWS best practices.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    option (e.g., ''Keys never expire'' vs. lifecycle management). Ensure distractors test nuance from centralized/decentralized,
    best practices.'

  Generate high-quality flashcards using the provided structure:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Incorporate elements like discussion trade-offs (centralized/decentralized), peer teaching steps, problem-solving
  scenarios into flashcard explanations.

  - Scaffolding: Generate flashcards grouped by 4 layers: [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM ABOVE].

  - Flashcard Schema: [INSERT FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Output in JSON: {''layer1'': [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'',
  ''type'': ''...''}], ...}.


  Ensure completeness: Cover AWS best practices (key rotation, auditing via CloudTrail, IAM least privilege, HSMs), centralized
  (org-wide, easier compliance) vs decentralized (granular, higher ops), multi-account/multi-region. Prioritize voter consensus
  (82.9% approval). Use web-grounded context: AWS KMS manages keys for encryption/signing; NIST SP 800-57 for lifecycles.


  Flashcards must promote Bloom''s progression: Start simple (recall definitions), build to complex (design plans). Make engaging/active:
  Include ''Apply it:'' prompts tying to scenarios. Vary types (Q/A 40%, MCQ 40%, Cloze 20%). No duplicates; test misconceptions
  (e.g., KMS not storing data).'
