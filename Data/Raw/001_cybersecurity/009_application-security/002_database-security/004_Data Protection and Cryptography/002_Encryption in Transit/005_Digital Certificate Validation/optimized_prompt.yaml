active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given recent CA breaches like DigiNotar or Symantec, debate the strengths and weaknesses of the current
    PKI model. Propose student-led alternatives such as WebPKI or Certificate Transparency logs, and evaluate their impact
    on database security in encrypted connections.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Core content from research: Digital certificates bind public keys to identities via signatures. PKI manages them; CAs issue;
  roots self-signed; chains build trust. Validation per RFC 5280: signature, dates, chain, revocation (CRL/OCSP). NIST: SP
  800-52r2 (TLS cert validation), SP 800-57 Pt1 (PKI). Sources: RFC 5280 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280),
  NIST SP 800-52r2 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-52r2.pdf), SP 800-57 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r5.pdf),

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards using exact schema: {''front'', ''back'': {''answer'', ''explanation'', ''bloom_level'',
  ''layer''}, ''distractors'' for MC}. Cover all objectives/activities/layers. Ensure university pedagogy: active recall,
  spaced repetition, misconceptions via distractors. Vary difficulty. Output as JSON array of flashcards. No duplicates; comprehensive
  coverage.'
