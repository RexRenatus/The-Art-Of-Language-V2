        "core_logic": "Data utility is critical because anonymization techniques often involve trade-offs with data accuracy or completeness. The goal is to find a balance where privacy is protected without rendering the data unusable for its intended purpose, such as statistical analysis or machine learning.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors focus on efficiency, complete PII removal, or legal compliance, which are related but distinct from the core concept of maintaining the data's usefulness for analysis.",
        "analogy": "It's like editing a book for clarity. You want to remove jargon and simplify sentences (anonymization), but you don't want to remove so much that the story becomes nonsensical or loses its meaning (data utility)."
