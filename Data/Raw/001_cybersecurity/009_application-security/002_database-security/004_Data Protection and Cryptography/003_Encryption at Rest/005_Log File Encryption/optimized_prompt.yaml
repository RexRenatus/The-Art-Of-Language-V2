active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of full log file encryption versus selective encryption in a high-volume logging
    environment. Consider performance impacts, compliance requirements (e.g., NIST SP 800-92), incident response needs, and
    real-world examples like the Equifax breach where log exposure amplified damage. Address common misconceptions that logs
    are non-sensitive.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  using Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, and scaffolding. Topic: Log File Encryption (Category: Cybersecurity > 008_Application
  Security > 012_Database Security; Entry: 004_Data Protection & 001_Cryptography > Encryption at Rest; Topic Hierarchy: Level
  1 Cybersecurity to Level 6 Log File Encryption).


  Core content: Synthesize from NIST SP 800-92 (log management guide emphasizing secure storage/transmission implying encryption),
  ACSC best practices (encrypt logs at rest/transit, key rotation), techniques (AES-256 symmetric, OpenSSL/AWS KMS/VeraCrypt/dm-crypt),
  best practices (full vs. selective, performance trade-offs, integration with ELK/Splunk/log rotation), and examples (Equifax
  breach).
