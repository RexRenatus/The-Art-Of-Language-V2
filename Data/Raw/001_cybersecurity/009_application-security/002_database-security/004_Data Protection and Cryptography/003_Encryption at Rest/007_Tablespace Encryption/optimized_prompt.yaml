  complete key management details, Oracle/SQL Server examples, and concept map integration.


  Generate 25-30 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet using the exact schema provided. Cover all learning objectives
  (1 per Bloom''s level minimum), distribute across scaffolding layers (Layer 1: 20%, Layer 2: 25%, Layer 3: 30%, Layer 4:
  25%). Mix formats: 40% definitions/recall (REMEMBER), 20% explanations (UNDERSTAND), 20% processes (APPLY), 10% comparisons
  (ANALYZE), 5% risk assessment (EVALUATE), 5% design (CREATE). Incorporate active learning hooks in explanations.


  Content Sources: Research summary (TDE transparently encrypts tablespaces/data at rest/backups using AES; two-tier keys:
  Master Key → Tablespace Key; Oracle steps via ADMINISTER KEY MANAGEMENT; SQL Server TDE; vs. Column Encryption; best practices:
  rotation, HSM, compliance GDPR/PCI-DSS). Use provided scaffolding for accuracy/completeness.
