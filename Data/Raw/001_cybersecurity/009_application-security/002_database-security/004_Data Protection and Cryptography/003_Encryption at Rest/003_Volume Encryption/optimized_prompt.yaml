active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of volume encryption versus file-level encryption for protecting
    sensitive databases on laptops. Consider scenarios like device theft or insider threats, and reference NIST SP 800-111
    guidelines. What factors would influence your choice for a healthcare organization?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truth (e.g., ''Uses DES instead of AES''), 3) Extreme/overstatement (e.g., ''100% secure against all quantum
    attacks''). Ensure distractors are realistic from voter/research context.'

  **Context & Sources:** Base on NIST SP 800-111 ''Guide to Storage Encryption Technologies'' (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-111.pdf):
  threats (theft, unauthorized access), solutions (volume/full-disk), key mgmt, implementation. Definitions: Volume=logical
  storage unit; protects data at rest via AES/keys. Tools: BitLocker, VeraCrypt, LUKS. Prior knowledge: Link to encryption
  basics.
