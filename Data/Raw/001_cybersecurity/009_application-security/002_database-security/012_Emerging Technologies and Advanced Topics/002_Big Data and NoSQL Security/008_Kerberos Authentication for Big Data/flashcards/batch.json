This TGT acts as proof of identity, allowing the user to request service tickets for various Big Data components (like HDFS, YARN, Hive) without needing to re-enter their password for each service.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Kerberos does not store credentials centrally for direct service access; it uses tickets. While SAML is used for SSO, it's a different protocol often used in web contexts, not the core Kerberos SSO mechanism. Direct password authentication defeats the purpose of SSO and Kerberos's security model.",
        "analogy": "SSO with Kerberos is like having a master key card (TGT) that gets you into the main building lobby (KDC). Once inside, you can use that card to get temporary access badges (service tickets) for different departments (services) without having to show your original ID to each department manager."
