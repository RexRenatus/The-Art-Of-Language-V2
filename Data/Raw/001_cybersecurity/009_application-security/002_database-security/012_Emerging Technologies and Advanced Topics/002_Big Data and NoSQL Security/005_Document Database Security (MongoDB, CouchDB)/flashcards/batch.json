They are particularly good at spotting someone trying to sneak in with a weapon (SQL injection), less so at stopping a large crowd from blocking the entrance (DoS) or someone trying to eavesdrop on conversations outside (MitM)."

        "core_logic": "By encrypting data at rest, in transit, and in use (e.g., with Queryable Encryption), MongoDB significantly reduces the time periods during which data is exposed in an unencrypted or less-protected state. This minimizes the 'window of vulnerability' that attackers could exploit.",

        "analogy": "Minimizing the window of vulnerability is like ensuring a valuable package is always tracked and secured, whether it's sitting in the warehouse (at rest), being shipped (in transit), or being opened by the recipient (in use), reducing the chances of it being lost or stolen at any point."
