active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between local OS authentication and remote administration
    for Oracle Listeners. Consider scenarios where remote access might be necessary (e.g., cloud environments) and propose
    mitigation strategies like VPNs or bastion hosts to prevent lateral movement in attacks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    firewalls); 2) Partial truths (e.g., ''remote admin is always secure with passwords''); 3) Related but wrong concepts
    (e.g., mix with TNSNAMES.ORA). Ensure distractors test deeper understanding (e.g., risks of remote access).'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Oracle Listener Security\
  \ (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 012_Database Security > 001_Database Configuration and Hardening\
  \ > Platform-Specific Hardening > Oracle Listener Security). Voter consensus (100% approval) emphasizes Bloom's Taxonomy\
  \ progression, 4-layer scaffolding, hands-on sims, prior knowledge (Oracle DB/Net basics), completed best practices (ACLs,\
  \ TCPS/SSL/wallets, valid node reg, local OS auth, no remote access ideally, OEM integration), and big picture (defense-in-depth\
  \ against lateral movement).\n\nResearch context: Oracle Net Listener manages connections; use local OS auth; ACLs for IP\
  \ control in listener.ora; endpoints/protocols; registration restrictions; best practices: TCPS/SSL, wallets, valid nodes,\
  \ LSNRCTL local-only.\n\nGenerate 50 high-quality flashcards (10-15 per Bloom's level focus, distributed across scaffolding\
  \ layers). Use the exact schema:\n- **Front:** [Question with format, Bloom's level, Layer tag]\n- **Back:**\n  - **Answer:**\
