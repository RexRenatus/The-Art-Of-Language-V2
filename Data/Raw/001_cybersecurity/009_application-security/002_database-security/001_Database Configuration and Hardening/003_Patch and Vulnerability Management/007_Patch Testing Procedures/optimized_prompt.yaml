active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a scenario where a zero-day vulnerability is discovered in a production database, debate the trade-offs
    between skipping patch testing for speed versus conducting full tests that delay deployment. What factors (e.g., risk
    level, business impact, NIST priorities) would influence your decision? Support with evidence from NIST SP 800-40.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
