active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a resource-constrained cloud environment hosting a PostgreSQL database, debate which security features
    (e.g., TDE, RLS, auditing, SSL/TLS) should be prioritized for enablement. Justify your choices based on threat models,
    compliance needs (e.g., CIS benchmarks), and performance impacts. What common misconception—that 'enabling everything
    improves security'—should be addressed?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ card: (1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Auditing logs all queries by
    default'' → No, requires config), (2) Plausible confusion (e.g., mix TDE with SSL/TLS), (3) Extreme/overgeneralization
    (e.g., ''Enable all features always'' → Risk-based). Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter-noted errors and
    database docs. Balance card types: 40% remember/understand, 30% apply/analyze, 30% evaluate/create.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert cybersecurity educator specializing in database security and flashcard generation using
  university pedagogy (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards
  for the topic ''Security Feature Enablement'' in the hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 012_Database
  Security > 001_Database Configuration and Hardening > Parameter and Configuration Management > Security Feature Enablement.


  CRITICAL: Focus EXCLUSIVELY on database-specific security features like Transparent Data Encryption (TDE), auditing (e.g.,
  pgaudit), row-level security (RLS), SSL/TLS enablement, password policies, network access controls (e.g., pg_hba.conf),
  failed login limits. Reference CIS benchmarks, PostgreSQL postgresql.conf, Oracle spfile, SQL Server sp_configure, MySQL
  my.cnf. IGNORE digital identity/NIST 800-63/IAM topics.

  - Learning Objectives: [insert the 6 objectives from above]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert the 4 layers from above]

  - Active Learning: Inspire questions from discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving (e.g., trade-offs, scenarios).


  Use this Flashcard Schema: [insert schema from above]. Generate 25 flashcards (JSON array of objects, each with ''front''
  and ''back'' object containing ''answer'', ''explanation'', ''distractors'', ''layer'', ''blooms_level'', ''misconception_addressed'').
  Ensure variety: 10 MCQ, 10 short answer, 5 cloze. Cover all layers/objectives evenly. Questions promote active recall, link
  to real configs (e.g., ''What parameter enables SSL in postgresql.conf?''). Explanations reference sources like CIS PostgreSQL
  Benchmark v14. Output ONLY the JSON array.'
