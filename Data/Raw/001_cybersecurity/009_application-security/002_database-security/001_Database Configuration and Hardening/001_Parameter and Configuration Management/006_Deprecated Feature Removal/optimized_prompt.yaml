  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of immediately removing deprecated features versus maintaining
    backward compatibility in a database used by legacy applications. Use real-world examples like TLS 1.0 deprecation (RFC
    8996) or MySQL old_password plugin to support your arguments, considering both security risks and operational impacts.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''safe if patched''), 2)
    Related but incorrect term (e.g., ''EOL'' vs ''Deprecation''), 3) Outdated alternative (e.g., weak crypto still in use).
    Ensure distractors are realistic, drawn from research (e.g., legacy SSL modes), and teach via explanation why wrong.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Database Security. Generate
  30 high-quality flashcards on ''Deprecated Feature Removal'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security
  > 012_Database Security > 001_Database Configuration and Hardening > Parameter and Configuration Management > Deprecated
  Feature Removal). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (objectives provided), active learning integration, 4-layer
  scaffolding.


  **Research Context (Completed):** Deprecation: Marking features obsolete. Sunsetting: Full retirement. EOL: No support.
  Risks: Unpatched vulns (CISA bad practices). DB Examples: MySQL old_password_plugin, PostgreSQL legacy SSL (ssl_renegotiation),
  SQL Server trace flags. Standards: RFC 8996 (TLS 1.0/1.1 deprecation, ietf.org/rfc8996); NIST SP 800-63B-4 (Digital Identity:
  Deprecates weak authenticators like SMS OTPs in lifecycle mgmt, nist.gov/sp800-63b); CISA KEV Catalog (cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities);
  MySQL Docs (dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/deprecated-features.html); PostgreSQL Docs (postgresql.org/docs/current/release-16.html#release-16-deprecated).


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list from JSON].

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full layers from JSON].

  **Active Learning:** Inspire flashcards that prompt recall for discussions/exercises (e.g., scenario Qs).


  **Generation Rules:**

  - 5 cards per Bloom''s level (balanced across objectives).

  - 40% MCQ (follow distractor protocol), 20% definitions, 20% identification, 20% scenarios.

  - Each card: Front (question), Back (answer + explanation tying to research/DB ex + Bloom''s + layer + source).

  - Ensure DB-specific (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server), align to subdomain.

  - Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'':
  ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''source'': ''...'', ''related_objective'': ''...''}}].
