active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of implementing RBAC versus ABAC in a cloud database environment
    (e.g., Azure AD). Consider scalability, management overhead, and security in dynamic teams. Support arguments with real-world
    examples like hospital patient records access.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  content: 'Define RBAC as a method restricting access based on roles. Key terms: Users (subjects like employees/devices),
    Roles (job function groups), Permissions (actions on resources: view/create/modify/delete), Sessions (active role instances).
    Core rules: 1) Role Assignment (user to role); 2) Role Authorization (permitted roles); 3) Role Activation (user activates
    roles in session). Textual concept map: Central: RBAC → Users → Roles → Permissions; Branches: Sessions (activation);
    Dependencies: Assignment → Activation → Permission Exercise.'

  focus: ''
  content: 'RBAC models: Core (basic flat structure), Hierarchical (inheritance: junior roles inherit senior), Constrained
    (SoD: mutual exclusion, e.g., can''t assign conflicting roles like Approver and Executor). Relations: Permissions grouped
    into roles; users assigned multiple roles but activate subset per session. Diagram description: Users |→ Roles (many-to-many)
    |→ Permissions (many-to-many).'

  content: 'Step-by-step: 1) Identify job functions → Define roles (e.g., Doctor: view/modify records); 2) Assign permissions
    to roles; 3) Assign users to roles; 4) Activate via sessions; 5) Database example (SQL): CREATE ROLE doctor; GRANT SELECT,
    UPDATE ON patient_records TO doctor; GRANT doctor TO user_john. Real-world: Hospital - Nurse role: read-only records,

  content: 'Integrate with ABAC (hybrid), cloud (Azure AD scopes), authentication. Benefits: Simplifies management, enforces
    least privilege. Pitfalls/Misconceptions: Role explosion (too many roles), ignoring reviews. Best practices: Periodic
    audits, SoD enforcement, constrained RBAC for compliance (e.g., GDPR in databases).'

  Use this comprehensive content for generation:

  [Insert full scaffolding layers, learning objectives, active learning, prerequisites, research context (core concepts, models,
  NIST rules, DB examples, SoD, sessions, hospital scenarios, pitfalls, benefits) here].


  Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy progression, active learning tie-ins (e.g., flashcards prompting discussion-like
  analysis), scaffolding from foundation to integration.


  Generate flashcards strictly following this schema:

  - Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''metadata'':
  {...}}, ''type'': ''MCQ/Cloze/etc.''}]

  - 50 flashcards total, distributed per schema rules.

  - Questions promote active recall; distractors plausible (misconceptions like role=permission).

  - Explanations scaffolded, measurable, with real-world DB ties (SQL GRANT, Azure scopes).

  - Ensure completeness: Cover truncated areas (user role assignment: via admin, dynamic/static), sessions, constrained RBAC,
  voter priorities (examples, pitfalls).


  Prioritize high voter consensus (82.9%): Explicit objectives, concept maps, step-by-step impl.


  Output ONLY the JSON array; no additional text.'
