    <discussion_prompt>In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of implementing RBAC versus ABAC in a cloud database environment (e.g., Azure AD). Consider scalability, management overhead, and security in dynamic teams. Support arguments with real-world examples like hospital patient records access.</discussion_prompt>

      <content>Define RBAC as a method restricting access based on roles. Key terms: Users (subjects like employees/devices), Roles (job function groups), Permissions (actions on resources: view/create/modify/delete), Sessions (active role instances). Core rules: 1) Role Assignment (user to role); 2) Role Authorization (permitted roles); 3) Role Activation (user activates roles in session). Textual concept map: Central: RBAC → Users → Roles → Permissions; Branches: Sessions (activation); Dependencies: Assignment → Activation → Permission Exercise.</content>

    <layer level="2" name="Layer 2">
      <focus/>
      <content>RBAC models: Core (basic flat structure), Hierarchical (inheritance: junior roles inherit senior), Constrained (SoD: mutual exclusion, e.g., can't assign conflicting roles like Approver and Executor). Relations: Permissions grouped into roles; users assigned multiple roles but activate subset per session. Diagram description: Users |→ Roles (many-to-many) |→ Permissions (many-to-many).</content>
    </layer>
    <layer level="3" name="Layer 3">
      <focus/>
      <content>Step-by-step: 1) Identify job functions → Define roles (e.g., Doctor: view/modify records); 2) Assign permissions to roles; 3) Assign users to roles; 4) Activate via sessions; 5) Database example (SQL): CREATE ROLE doctor; GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON patient_records TO doctor; GRANT doctor TO user_john. Real-world: Hospital - Nurse role: read-only records, no delete.</content>

    <layer level="4" name="Layer 4">
      <focus/>
      <content>Integrate with ABAC (hybrid), cloud (Azure AD scopes), authentication. Benefits: Simplifies management, enforces least privilege. Pitfalls/Misconceptions: Role explosion (too many roles), ignoring reviews. Best practices: Periodic audits, SoD enforcement, constrained RBAC for compliance (e.g., GDPR in databases).</content>

    <system_prompt>You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Domain: 008_Application Security &gt; 012_Database Security &gt; 012_Access Control and Authentication &gt; Authorization and Privilege Management &gt; RBAC. Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity (L1) → 008_Application Security (L2) → 012_Database Security (L3) → 012_Access Control and Authentication (L4) → Authorization and Privilege Management (L5) → Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (L6).
Use this comprehensive content for generation:
[Insert full scaffolding layers, learning objectives, active learning, prerequisites, research context (core concepts, models, NIST rules, DB examples, SoD, sessions, hospital scenarios, pitfalls, benefits) here].
Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom's Taxonomy progression, active learning tie-ins (e.g., flashcards prompting discussion-like analysis), scaffolding from foundation to integration.
Generate flashcards strictly following this schema:
- Output as JSON array of objects: [{'front': '...', 'back': {'answer': '...', 'explanation': '...', 'metadata': {...}}, 'type': 'MCQ/Cloze/etc.'}]
- 50 flashcards total, distributed per schema rules.
- Questions promote active recall; distractors plausible (misconceptions like role=permission).
- Explanations scaffolded, measurable, with real-world DB ties (SQL GRANT, Azure scopes).
- Ensure completeness: Cover truncated areas (user role assignment: via admin, dynamic/static), sessions, constrained RBAC, voter priorities (examples, pitfalls).
Prioritize high voter consensus (82.9%): Explicit objectives, concept maps, step-by-step impl.
Output ONLY the JSON array; no additional text.</system_prompt>
