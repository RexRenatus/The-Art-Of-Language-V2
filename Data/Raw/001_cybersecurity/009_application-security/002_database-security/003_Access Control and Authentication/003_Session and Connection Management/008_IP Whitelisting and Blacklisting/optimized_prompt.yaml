active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the merits of IP whitelisting versus blacklisting in database security. In small groups, argue
    for one approach in a scenario where a company has remote workers with dynamic IPs and faces repeated brute-force attacks
    from unknown sources. Reference NIST SP 800-167 principles on whitelisting, discuss limitations like IP spoofing, and
    propose hybrid solutions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Topic Context (Hierarchy):** Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 012_Database Security > 012_Access Control and
  Authentication > Session and Connection Management > IP Whitelisting and Blacklisting.


  **Core Knowledge:**

  - IP Whitelisting: Allow only listed trusted IPs (deny by default, proactive security).

  - IP Blacklisting: Block listed malicious IPs (allow by default, reactive).

  - Best Practices (complete): Prioritize whitelisting over blacklisting; use CIDR for ranges (e.g., 10.0.0.0/8); regular
  reviews (quarterly); handle dynamic IPs via VPN/MFA; maintenance/logging/monitoring false positives/negatives; integrate
  with firewalls/ACLs, rate limiting, geo-IP; NIST SP 800-167 (whitelisting principles applicable); PostgreSQL pg_hba.conf
  example: ''host database user 192.168.1.0/24 md5''; risks: spoofing, scalability.


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list from JSON above].

  - Scaffolding: Generate cards progressively across 4 layers [Insert full scaffolding from JSON above].

  - Active Learning Ties: Link cards to discussion (whitelisting vs blacklisting debate), peer teaching (configs), problem-solving
  (SQL injection scenario).


  **Task:** Generate 75 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet. Strictly follow the Flashcard Schema:
