active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a microservices-based e-commerce platform, debate the security trade-offs of Database Per Service
    versus shared database approaches. Use the 2021 Capital One breach as a case study to argue how this pattern reduces blast
    radius and prevents data exfiltration across services.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards optimized for university-level learning using Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, and
  4-layer scaffolding. Incorporate these exact elements:


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the full ''learning_objectives'' array here]


  **Active Learning:** Embed prompts from [discussion_prompt, peer_teaching_activity, problem_solving_exercise] into 4-5 flashcards
  as scenario-based questions.


  **Scaffolding:** Distribute flashcards: 6-7 per Layer 1 (Foundation), 6-7 per Layer 2 (Components, complete Implementation
  Options: Schema per Service pros/cons/weak isolation; Separate DBs best isolation; Containerized), 6-7 per Layer 3 (Implementation
  steps/mitigations), 4-5 per Layer 4 (Integration with API gateways/zero-trust/encryption).


  **Content Sources:** Use research context (microservices defs, benefits: independence/encapsulation/technology choice, security:
  blast radius reduction). Complete truncated sections per voters (implementation variations, security risks of alternatives
  like shared DB lateral movement).


  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly follow [flashcard_schema.structure]: Mix cloze (30%), MCQ (40% with distractor_protocol),
  Q&A (30%). Balance Bloom''s: 20% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate, 20% Create. Tag each: {''bloom_level'':
  ''...'', ''scaffold_layer'': #, ''hierarchy'': ''full path''}.


  **Output Format:** JSON array of objects: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''tags'': {...}, ''explanation'':
  ''...''}]. Ensure cybersecurity focus (e.g., HIPAA, breaches). No duplicates; active recall emphasis.'
