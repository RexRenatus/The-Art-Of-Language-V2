active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages and limitations of quantitative (e.g., CVSS) versus qualitative
    (e.g., DREAD) risk scoring methodologies when prioritizing vulnerabilities in database security. Provide real-world examples
    from vulnerability assessments and justify your position using NIST SP 800-30 guidelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate high-quality Anki-style flashcards using the provided schema. Cover these key content areas (complete/expanded
  from research): Core concepts (risk assessment, vulnerability, threat, consequence); Frameworks (NIST CSF 2.0: Govern/Identify/etc.;
  NIST SP 800-30/37: 9-step process; ISO 31000: full - establish context, identify/assess risks (analysis/evaluation), treat,
  monitor/communicate/review [https://www.iso.org/standard/65694.html]); Scoring methods (CVSS v4.0: metrics like Attack Vector/Complexity,
  Base/Threat/Environmental scores, formula [https://www.first.org/cvss/v4-0]; OWASP Risk Rating: Likelihood (Technical/Skill)
  x Impact (Business/Technical) matrix [https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology]; DREAD: qualitative
  scale; qualitative/quantitative scales). Applications: Database security (SQLi, weak auth), vuln assessment prioritization,
  threat intel integration.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert list above]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert layers above]

  - Active Learning: Draw from scenarios for applied cards.


  Use exact Flashcard Schema: Front (question + tags), Back (answer, explanation w/ sources/hyperlinks like https://cisa.gov,
  https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.29.pdf for CSF 2.0, explanation, distractors explained). Ensure pedagogical
  alignment: University-style (Bloom''s progression), active recall, misconceptions addressed. Output 50 flashcards in JSON
  array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''hints'': ''...''}}, ...]. Balance
  coverage, no duplicates.'
