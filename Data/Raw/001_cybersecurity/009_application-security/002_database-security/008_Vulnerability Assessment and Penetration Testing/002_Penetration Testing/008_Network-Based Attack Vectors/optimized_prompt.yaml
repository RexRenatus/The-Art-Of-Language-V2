active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the most critical network-based attack vector for database security (e.g.,
    exposed MSSQL port 1433 vs. malware propagation). Use MITRE ATT&CK examples to support your position and link to real-world
    breaches like those referenced on attack.mitre.org. Consider trade-offs in detection vs. prevention.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
