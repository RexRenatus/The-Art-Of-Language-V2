active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages and limitations of using OpenVAS for database vulnerability
    scanning compared to commercial tools like Nessus or Qualys. Consider factors such as cost, NVT coverage for SQL injection
    detection, and integration with standards like PCI-DSS.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Topic: OpenVAS Database Scanning (Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 012_Database Security > 006_Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing
  > Security Testing Tools > OpenVAS Database Scanning). Use the provided Learning Objectives (spanning Bloom''s REMEMBER
  to CREATE), Active Learning components, Scaffolding Layers (4 layers with prior knowledge, concept map, completed best practices),
  and Flashcard Schema to generate 50-75 high-quality flashcards.


  Incorporate research context: OpenVAS (GVM) uses NVT Database from Greenbone Feed for vuln scanning; aligns with PCI-DSS/NIST;
  best practices include feed sync (greenbone-feed-sync), credentialed scans, policy config, false positive handling, reporting.


  Related concepts: Nessus/Qualys comparisons, SQLi NVTs.


  Output ONLY in JSON array of flashcards, each as: {''front'': ''Question'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''distractors'': [''d1'', ''d2'', ''d3''], ''related_concept'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''1-4''}}.
  Ensure active learning tie-ins (e.g., reference discussion scenarios). Balance Bloom''s levels and layers. Make explanations
  pedagogical (scaffolded, university-style).'
