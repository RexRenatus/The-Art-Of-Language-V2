  discussion_prompt: 'In a post-database incident scenario where forensics revealed weak encryption (SC-28) and inadequate
    auditing (AU-6), debate: ''Should organizations prioritize NIST CSF Recover function over SP 800-53 control enhancements
    for rapid improvement, or vice versa? Support with pros/cons and real-world examples.'' Encourage critical thinking by
    requiring evidence from voter-suggested controls.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 30 high-quality flashcards on
  ''Security Control Improvement'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 012_Database Security > 012_002_Incident
  Response and Forensics > 010_Post-Incident Activities > Security Control Improvement). Cover post-incident database security
  using NIST CSF 2.0 (esp. Respond/Recover for improvements) and NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (focus families: AC e.g. AC-2; AU e.g.
  AU-6; SC e.g. SC-8, SC-28; applications to encryption, auditing, access post-forensics).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the array above]. Distribute flashcards: 5 Remember/Understand, 10 Apply/Analyze, 10 Evaluate/Create,
  5 mixed.

  - Active Learning: Tie explanations to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving.

  - Scaffolding: 8 cards/Layer1, 8/Layer2, 8/Layer3, 6/Layer4. Include concept map nodes as prompts.

  - Voter Consensus: 67.1% approval; emphasize completeness on SP 800-53, database specifics.

  - Research: Security controls as safeguards; CSF risk-based outcomes; SP 800-53 control catalog.


  Use exact Flashcard Schema: Output as JSON array of 30 objects. Ensure university pedagogy: Bloom''s progression, active
  recall, scaffolding. No adult/offensive content.'
