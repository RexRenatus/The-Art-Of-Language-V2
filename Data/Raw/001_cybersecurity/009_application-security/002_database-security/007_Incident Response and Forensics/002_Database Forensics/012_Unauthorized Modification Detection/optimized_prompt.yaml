active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains NIST SP 800-161 supply chain security controls and their application to database
    scenarios (e.g., tampering detection via transaction logs). The partner then teaches back by applying it to a hypothetical
    insider threat case, providing feedback on accuracy and completeness.
  problem_solving: Using a simulated SQLite or MySQL database log file (provided or created via tools like DB Browser for
    SQLite), students analyze entries to detect unauthorized modifications (e.g., altered rows without audit trails). Document
    findings, propose evidence chain of custody, and recommend remediation steps.

      with audit trail; partial truths from adjacent concepts like file hashing vs. row checksums; outdated methods). Ensure
      1 distractor per Bloom's level progression.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Database Forensics. Topic:\
  \ Unauthorized Modification Detection (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 012_Database Security > 012_002_Incident\

  \ active learning activities, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema to generate 25 high-quality flashcards.\n\nIncorporate:\n\
  - Bloom's Taxonomy progression (remember to create).\n- Database-specific techniques: transaction logs, redo logs, audit\
  \ trails, row checksums, temporal tables, ACID properties.\n- NIST contexts: SP 1800-34 (cyber supply chain), SP 800-161\
  \ (supply chain risks like tampering, counterfeiting).\n- Links to CIA triad (integrity), incident response.\n- Voter priorities:\
  \ progressive scaffolding, measurable verbs, completeness with tools (Autopsy, SQLite).\n\nScaffolding layers for content\
  \ sourcing:\n1. Foundation: Terms (transaction log, checksums).\n2. Components: Relationships (logs + NIST frameworks).\n\
  3. Implementation: Procedures (log analysis steps).\n4. Integration: IR/ML connections.\n\nOutput ONLY in JSON array of\
