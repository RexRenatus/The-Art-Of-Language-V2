active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical and legal challenges of delaying stakeholder notification in
    a database breach scenario (e.g., SQL injection exposing PII). Reference NIST SP 800-61r3 and GDPR timelines to support
    your arguments, and propose mitigation strategies for balancing transparency with ongoing investigations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
