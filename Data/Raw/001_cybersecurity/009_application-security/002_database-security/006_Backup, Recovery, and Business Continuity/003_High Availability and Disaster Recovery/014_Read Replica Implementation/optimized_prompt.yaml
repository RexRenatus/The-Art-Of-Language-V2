  discussion_prompt: 'In a cybersecurity context, debate the tradeoffs of using asynchronous versus synchronous replication
    for read replicas. Consider scenarios like a DDoS attack causing primary failure: how does each method impact data integrity,
    availability, and potential exploit windows from replication lag?'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

      RDS auto-secures without TLS'').'

  Incorporate this completed research context:

  ### Core Concepts: [Insert full core concepts from provided research, plus:] ### Industry Standards: ISO 27001 (A.12.4.1
  Logging for replica monitoring, A.17.1 Continuity via HA), NIST CSF (PR.DS-2 Data Transit Protection via TLS, DE.CM-7 Monitoring),
  CIS Benchmarks (MySQL 2.1: Enable SSL, PostgreSQL 9.1: Replication Encryption). Cloud: AWS RDS (IAM auth, KMS encryption),
  Azure Cosmos DB replicas.

  ### Risks/Best Practices: TLS for streams, RBAC/IAM on replicas, monitor lag >5s for exploits, secure failover promotion.

  ### Sources: MySQL.com Replication, PostgreSQL.org Streaming Replication, AWS RDS Docs, NIST SP 800-53, CIS MySQL 1.3.0,
  ISO 27001:2022.


  Prior Knowledge: Basic DB (ACID, transactions), backups.

  Big Picture: Builds resilient DB security for zero-downtime under attacks.
