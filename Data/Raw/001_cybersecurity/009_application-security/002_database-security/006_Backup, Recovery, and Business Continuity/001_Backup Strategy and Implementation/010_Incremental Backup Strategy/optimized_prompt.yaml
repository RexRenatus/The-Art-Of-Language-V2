active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a scenario where storage space is limited but recovery time is critical, debate the trade-offs between
    incremental, differential, and full backup strategies. Which would you choose for a database handling financial transactions
    and why? Consider factors like RTO, storage costs, and ransomware recovery.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MC question based on common misconceptions: 1) Confuse incremental
    with differential (e.g., ''changes since last full''), 2) Overstate benefits (e.g., ''fastest restore''), 3) Ignore chain
    dependency (e.g., ''restore with last incremental only''). Ensure distractors are realistic from research/voter inputs
    (e.g., storage miscalculations, RTO errors).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Topic: Incremental Backup Strategy (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application
  Security > 012_Database Security > Backup, Recovery, Business Continuity > Backup Strategy and Implementation > Incremental
  Backup Strategy). Use this research context: Incremental backups copy changes since last backup (full/incremental); vs.
  full (all data), differential (since last full). Pros: low storage/time; Cons: complex restore (full + all incrementals).
  Standards: NIST PR.IP-4, CIS Controls 11. Tools: mysqldump. Include pros/cons, restore process, hybrid strategies, database
  encryption.


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the array above]

  - Active Learning: [reference discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving from above]

  - Scaffolding: Generate 10-12 cards per layer [paste scaffolding descriptions].

  - Ensure voter consensus: Cover CIS Controls completion, concept map (textual: Central: Incremental → vs Full/Diff, Benefits,
  Standards).


  Generate flashcards using this schema: [paste flashcard_schema above]. Output ONLY in JSON: {"flashcards": [array of objects,
  each {"front": "...", "back": "...", "type": "MC/Cloze/etc.", "bloom_level": "Analyze", "scaffolding_layer": "2", "tags":
  ["IncrementalBackup"] }]}. Balance across Bloom''s levels (20% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate, 20%
  Create). Promote active recall, address misconceptions.'
