active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the balance between notification volume to avoid alert fatigue and ensuring critical events (e.g.,
    SQL injection attempts in databases) are not missed. Reference NIST SP 800-92 log management guidelines and ACSC Essential
    Eight real-time alerting requirements. Students must propose quantifiable thresholds (e.g., event severity scores) and
    defend their position in groups.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Completed Research Context (Web-Grounded, Voter-Completed):**

  Security event notifications alert on security events in real-time for database security. Core: Event (occurrence), Incident
  (violation), Logging (recording), Detection (identification), Notifications (alerts). Standards: NIST SP 800-92 (Log Management:
  sources, analysis, notifications to reduce response time); NIST SP 800-61 R3 (Incident Handling with CSF 2.0); NIST SP 800-53
  R5 (AU-6 notifications); ACSC Essential Eight (Application Control, real-time alerting for logs, daily reviews to detect
  anomalies; mitigate alert fatigue via prioritization). Best Practices: Thresholds, SIEM integration (Splunk/ELK), AI filtering.
  Sources: [NIST 800-92](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/92/final), [NIST 800-61 R3](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/61/r3/final),
  [NIST 800-53 R5](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/final), [ACSC Essential Eight](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cybersecurity/essential-eight),
