  [Insert full Research Context here, completed: Behavioral Analytics (BA) analyzes user/entity patterns via AI/ML to detect
  anomalies unlike rule-based methods. Core Concepts: BA, UBA (users), EBA (entities), Anomalies, ML/AI. Process: 1. Data
  Collection (logs, queries). 2. Processing/Baselines. 3. Anomaly Detection (e.g., unusual queries for compromised creds).
  4. Alerting. Role: Detects insider threats, exfiltration in databases. Examples: 3AM logins, high SELECT volume. Sources:
  NIST SP 800-53, Gartner SIEM 2023, etc.]
