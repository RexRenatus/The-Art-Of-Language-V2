active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of Unified Auditing versus traditional auditing in terms
    of performance overhead, storage requirements, data comprehensiveness, and ease of analysis for incident response. Reference
    NIST SP 800-53 controls and provide real-world examples from database security breaches.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 1 common misconception (e.g., ''Unified Auditing requires separate OS logs'' vs. consolidated).

    - 1 related but incorrect term (e.g., ''AUDIT_TRAIL=DB'' vs. ''UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL'').

    - 1 edge case or outdated method (e.g., traditional ''AUDIT SESSION'' vs. policy-based).

    Ensure distractors are realistic from Oracle docs/NIST.'
