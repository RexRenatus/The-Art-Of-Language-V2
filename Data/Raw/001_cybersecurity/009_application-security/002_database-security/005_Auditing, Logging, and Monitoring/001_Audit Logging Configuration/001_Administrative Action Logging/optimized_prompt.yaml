  discussion_prompt: In a healthcare organization subject to HIPAA, debate the trade-offs between comprehensive administrative
    action logging for compliance and protecting patient privacy. Reference NIST SP 800-92 and CIS Control 8 to argue for
    what events should be logged (e.g., privilege escalations), how long they should be retained (e.g., 1-7 years), and potential
    risks of over-logging (e.g., storage costs, privacy breaches).
  peer_teaching: Pair students; one student explains core concepts of administrative action logging (e.g., what constitutes
    an admin action per NIST, required log data elements like timestamp, user ID, action type) using a provided textual concept
    map. The partner 'teaches back' by applying concepts to a scenario like detecting privilege escalation in a database.
    Switch roles and provide feedback.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A database admin performs unauthorized changes (inspired by Capital One S3 breach). Students
    design a mock audit log configuration for a database (e.g., capture DDL changes), simulate logs, then query them to investigate
    and reconstruct the incident, proposing mitigations.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Administrative Action
  Logging'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 012_Database Security > 007_Auditing, Logging, and
  Monitoring > Audit Logging Configuration > Administrative Action Logging). Builds on auditing basics.


  Research Context: Administrative action logging records elevated-privilege events (e.g., account changes) for audits (NIST
  SP 800-92: log management process; CIS Control 8: collect/review/retain logs). Key: Audit trails for incidents/compliance.


  Use these Learning Objectives [insert array above]. Incorporate Active Learning for context (e.g., HIPAA debates, breach
  scenarios). Follow Scaffolding Layers [insert array above] for progression.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards per Flashcard Schema [insert schema above]. Mix types/Bloom''s (30% lower-order, 40%
  middle, 30% higher). Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, distractors from misconceptions.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of objects, each matching schema structure. No extra text.
