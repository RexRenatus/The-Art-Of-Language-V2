active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a multi-cloud environment using AWS, Azure, and GCP for database access (e.g., RDS on AWS, Cosmos
    DB on Azure, Cloud SQL on GCP), debate the trade-offs of SAML versus OpenID Connect (OIDC) for identity federation. Consider
    scalability, security vulnerabilities (e.g., XML signature wrapping attacks in SAML, token introspection issues in OIDC),
    compliance with NIST SP 800-63, and integration with database-specific IAM policies. Address common misconceptions, such
    as assuming all protocols eliminate the need for MFA.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    like ''SAML uses JSON tokens'' or ''OIDC handles only authentication, not authorization''). Base on voter/addressed issues

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Multi-Cloud Identity Federation
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 012_Database Security > Cloud 012_Database Security > Multi-Cloud
  and Hybrid Security > Multi-Cloud Identity Federation). Note: Though under Database Security, focus on federation for securing
  DB access across clouds (e.g., IAM integration for RDS, Cloud SQL). Prior knowledge: Basic IAM, SSO, OAuth/SAML from Application
  Security.


  Core content from research: FIM enables SSO across clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP) using standards like SAML (XML assertions, SSO),
  OAuth 2.0 (authorization framework), OIDC (identity layer). Key: IdP/SP trust, token validation, risks (XML wrapping, session
  hijacking). Sources: eajournals.org, gitguardian.com, NIST SP 800-63.
