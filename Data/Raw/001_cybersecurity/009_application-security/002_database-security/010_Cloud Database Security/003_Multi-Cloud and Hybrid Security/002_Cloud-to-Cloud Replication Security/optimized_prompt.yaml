active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the security trade-offs between synchronous and asynchronous replication in a multi-cloud environment.
    Which method would you choose for a financial institution handling sensitive customer data, and why? Consider RPO, performance,
    compliance (e.g., NIST SP 800-53), and potential risks like data exposure during transit.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [REMEMBER: Define...; UNDERSTAND: Explain...; etc.] – Ensure flashcards target all Bloom''s levels.

  - Active Learning: Use discussion on sync/async trade-offs, peer teaching on controls, problem-solving for AWS-to-GCP migration
  to inspire analytical cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards: 25% Layer 1 (foundations/prerequisites like IaaS/PaaS/SaaS, RPO/RTO), 25% Layer 2
  (components: sync/async risks, controls like TLS 1.3/IAM/KMS/checksums), 25% Layer 3 (implementation steps), 25% Layer 4
  (NIST CSF/SP 800-53/800-210 integration, zero-trust, big picture in multi-cloud resilience).

  - Research: Cover definitions (sync/async/snapshot replication), risks (transit/rest/access/config/compliance), standards
  (NIST CSF full framework: Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover; SP 800-53 controls).

  - Best Practices: Security controls (TLS 1.3 transit, at-rest encryption, IAM, logging, integrity checks). Prior knowledge
  links to NIST SP 800-145.


  Generate exactly 25 high-quality flashcards following this schema: JSON array of objects with snake_case fields – question_text
  (engaging MCQ), correct_answer, distractors (exactly 3 plausible options with misconception/related/edge distractors), explanation
  (why correct, why each distractor wrong, cite sources/Bloom''s level). Vary formats for active recall. Output ONLY valid
  JSON array, no other text.'
