        "core_logic": "Proactive security involves anticipating and mitigating threats before they cause significant damage. Cloud database visibility enables this by continuously monitoring for deviations from normal behavior, such as unusual query types or access from unexpected locations, which can signal an emerging threat.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The correct answer highlights how visibility provides early warnings. The distractors describe automated response, operational metrics, or basic preventative controls, which are not direct outcomes of visibility data analysis for proactive security.",
        "analogy": "Proactive security through visibility is like a weather forecaster analyzing atmospheric data to predict a storm, allowing for preparations before it hits, rather than just reporting on the storm after it has arrived."
