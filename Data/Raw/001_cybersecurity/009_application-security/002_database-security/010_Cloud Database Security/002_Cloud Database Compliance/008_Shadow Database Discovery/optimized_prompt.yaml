active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the organizational impacts of undiscovered shadow databases on compliance
    standards like GDPR or HIPAA. Provide examples of real-world breaches (e.g., unpatched shadow DBs leading to data leaks)
    and propose mitigation priorities, encouraging critical thinking on risk prioritization.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Shadow DBs are always malicious''
      vs. unmanaged legit); 2) Partial truth (e.g., wrong port like 8080 instead of 1433); 3) Framework mix-up (e.g., NIST
      RA-5 instead of CM-8). Ensure distractors are realistic from voter/research context (e.g., wrong cloud API).'
    quality_check: Distractors must be >70% plausible to educated users but incorrect; no giveaways.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education on ''Shadow Database Discovery''. Use the
