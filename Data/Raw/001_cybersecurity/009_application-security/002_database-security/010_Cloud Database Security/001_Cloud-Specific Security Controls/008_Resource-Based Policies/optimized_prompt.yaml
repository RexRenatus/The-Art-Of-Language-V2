active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a multi-tenant cloud database environment (e.g., AWS RDS shared across teams), debate the trade-offs
    of resource-based policies versus RBAC. When does one provide better granularity for zero-trust architecture? Support
    with examples from NIST CSF 2.0 PR.AC-4.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Cloud-specific traps: e.g., ''Only for AWS S3'' (wrong, applies to RDS/SQL too).'

  Topic: Resource-Based Policies (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 012_Database Security > Cloud 012_Database
  Security > Cloud-Specific Security Controls > Resource-Based Policies). Use this to create optimized Anki-style flashcards
  promoting Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, and scaffolding.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the learning_objectives array here verbatim].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Weave in prompts from [active_learning] into explanations (e.g., ''Apply via peer teaching:
  Implement this in AWS IAM'').


  **Scaffolding Content:** Strictly base flashcards on these 4 layers: [Insert full scaffolding object here verbatim]. Use
  cloud examples (AWS IAM RDS/S3, Azure SQL policies, GCP Cloud SQL IAM).


  **Big Picture:** Resource-based policies enable granular, resource-attached access for zero-trust, least privilege in cloud
  DBs; aligns NIST CSF 2.0 PR.AC-4 (completed: Access permissions and restrictions are applied consistent with least privilege);
  NIST SP 800-53 AC-6. Sources: AWS IAM docs (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html), Azure
  Security (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/security-overview), GCP IAM (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview),
  NIST CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/framework).


  **Output Format:** JSON array of flashcards. Each: {''front'': ''Question + A/B/C/D options'', ''back'': {''correct'': ''A.
  Correct Answer'', ''explanation'': ''Detailed (link to objective/layer/active learning)'', ''references'': [''link1'']}}.
  Follow [flashcard_schema] exactly: MCQ with distractors per protocol, 40-60 cards balanced by layer/Bloom''s. Ensure university-level
  depth, no generic content—tailor to cloud DB security.'
