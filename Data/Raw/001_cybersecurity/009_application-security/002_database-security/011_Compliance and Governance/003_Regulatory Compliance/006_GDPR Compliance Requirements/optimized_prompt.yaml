active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given a scenario where a company collects user location data for advertising purposes without explicit
    consent, debate whether it violates GDPR principles of purpose limitation and data minimization. Consider business benefits
    versus privacy rights, evaluate technical alternatives like pseudonymization, and propose a compliant data processing
    strategy.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    of ''72 hours'' for breach notification; ''anonymized data is exempt'' when pseudonymized may not be); (2) Partial truths

    (4) Over/under-statements (e.g., ''DPO required for all companies'' vs. ''high-risk''). Ensure distractors teach by explaining

  Incorporate research: GDPR applies globally to EU data; personal/sensitive data defs; processing ops; controller/processor;
  7 principles (lawfulness..., purpose limitation..., data minimisation..., accuracy, storage limitation, integrity/confidentiality,
  accountability).


  Use these EXACT learning objectives: [insert full array from ''learning_objectives''].

  Scaffolding layers: [insert full descriptions from ''scaffolding_layers''].

  Active learning for context: [insert summaries from ''active_learning''].


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards following EXACT ''flashcard_schema'': Mix types, balance layers/Bloom''s, distractors
  protocol, explanations. Cover all voter priorities (e.g., 10% on breaches/DPIA/DPO, 20% principles/roles, 20% technical
  DB measures, 20% rights/scenarios, 30% integration/plans).
