  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the expansion of GLBA Safeguards Rule applicability to non-traditional financial entities like
    automobile dealers: Should it cover them, what risks (e.g., data breaches exposing customer financial info) arise if not,
    and how do recent breaches (e.g., auto finance hacks) support or challenge this? Connect to CIA triad impacts.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **GLBA Safeguards Rule Summary:** FTC mandate for financial institutions (lenders, advisors, insurers, auto dealers extending
  credit) to protect customer data via ISP. Core: GLBA (1999 law: Privacy/Safeguards Rules); Safeguards Rule (admin/tech/physical
  safeguards for confidentiality/integrity per CIA triad); Customer Info (PII financial data); ISP (risk assessment, safeguards
  design/implement, employee training, service provider oversight, monitoring/testing/evaluation, incident response, board
  reporting by Qualified Individual, ongoing adjustments). Sources: ftc.gov/business-guidance/privacy-security/gramm-leach-bliley-act;
