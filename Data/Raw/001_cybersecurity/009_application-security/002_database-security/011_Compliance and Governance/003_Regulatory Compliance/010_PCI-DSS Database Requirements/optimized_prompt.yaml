  peer_teaching: 'In pairs, assign each partner one PCI DSS requirement relevant to databases (e.g., Req 3: Protect stored
    data vs. Req 8: User authentication). Teach-back to the group: Explain the requirement, database implications, and one
    implementation step. Peers quiz each other with ''what if'' scenarios (e.g., ''What if SAD is accidentally logged?'').'
  problem_solving: 'Design a compliant database schema for an e-commerce site''s CDE: Include segmentation (Req 1), encryption
    for CHD (Req 3), RBAC (Req 7-8), logging (Req 10), and vulnerability scanning (Req 11). Present as ER diagram with justifications,
    then peer-review for gaps using a PCI DSS checklist.'

    post-auth if tokenized''); 4) Partial truths (e.g., ''PAN only if masked''). Ensure distractors are realistic from breaches
    like Target (e.g., ''Logging not needed for DB reads'').'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in PCI-DSS Database Requirements
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 012_Database Security > 016_Compliance and Governance > Regulatory
  Compliance > PCI-DSS Database Requirements). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (tag each card), active learning
  (link activities), 4-layer scaffolding (build from foundation to integration), and distractor-best practices for MCQs.


  CONTENT BASIS:

  - Foundation (Layer1): PCI-DSS defs, CHD (PAN/name/exp/service), SAD (track/CVV/PIN—no post-auth storage), CDE scope.

  - Components (Layer2): 12 reqs/6 objectives w/DB focus (Req1: segment/firewall; Req2: no defaults; Req3: encrypt CHD; Req4:
  transmit crypto; Req5: anti-malware; Req6: secure dev; Req7: need-to-know; Req8: auth/MFA; Req9: physical; Req10: log/monitor;
  Req11: test/scan; Req12: policy).

  - Implementation (Layer3): Steps for DB encrypt (TDE), RBAC, logging, scans.

  - Integration (Layer4): Cases (Target 2013), key mgmt/HSMs, PCI 4.0, tools (Imperva).

  ACTIVE LEARNING TIES: [insert summaries above; link 1-2 cards per activity].


  Generate 25 flashcards using schema: Front (Q/cloze/MCQ), Back {answer, explanation (w/req ref/DB impl/pitfall), bloom_level,
  layer, active_link}. Balance: 40% MCQ w/distractors (common errors: CHD/SAD mixups, scope creep). Cover all 12 reqs, progressive
  complexity (Layer1 heavy in REMEMBER, Layer4 in CREATE). Output as JSON array of objects. Ensure accuracy from PCI standards;
  no SAD storage emphasis.'
