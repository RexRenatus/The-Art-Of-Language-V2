active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Analyze a recent cyber incident (e.g., ransomware attack on a financial database) and debate how it could
    violate SOX Section 404. Identify key controls that failed (e.g., access controls, audit logging) and explain how the
    COSO framework could prevent recurrence through risk assessment and monitoring.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., confuse SOX with
    PCI-DSS), 2) Similar terms (e.g., mix COSO components like ''Control Environment'' vs ''Risk Assessment''), 3) Partial
    truths (e.g., correct for non-financial context), 4) Web-grounded errors (e.g., overlook Section 404 auditor role). Ensure
    distractors promote analysis (e.g., ''SOX only applies to public companies'' as distractor if context is broader).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, focusing on SOX Compliance
  Controls (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 012_Database Security > 016_Compliance and Governance
  > Regulatory Compliance > SOX Compliance Controls). Use the provided research context: SOX (2002 Act post-Enron/WorldCom
  for financial accuracy), ICFR (reliable financial reporting), Section 404 (ICFR assessments by management/auditors), key
  controls (critical for reliability), cybersecurity intersection (protecting financial data integrity in databases via IT
  controls). Incorporate COSO framework (5 components: Control Environment, Risk Assessment, Control Activities, Information
  & Communication, Monitoring). Prerequisites: Database security basics (access controls, encryption, auditing). Related:
  ITGC, PCAOB, NIST, PCI-DSS.
