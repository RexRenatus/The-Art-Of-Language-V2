active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the benefits and challenges of 'shift-left' security in DevSecOps pipelines.
    How does it reduce production vulnerabilities, and what cultural changes are needed for Dev, Sec, and Ops teams? Reference
    NIST CSF and real-world breaches like SolarWinds.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
