active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between fully automated security gates and manual approvals in CD pipelines. Consider
    impacts on deployment speed, false positives/negatives, compliance requirements (e.g., SOC 2, GDPR), and real-world examples
    from GitHub Actions or Jenkins in enterprises.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    errors (e.g., ignore false positives), 1 on edge cases (e.g., manual vs. auto gates). Ensure plausibility from research
    context (OWASP risks, SLSA levels). Avoid obvious wrongs.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Continuous Deployment Security
  Gates (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Secure Software Development Lifecycle > Secure 009_Deployment
  and Release > Secure Deployment Processes > Continuous deployment security gates). Use the provided learning_objectives,
  active_learning components, scaffolding layers, and flashcard_schema to create high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized
  flashcards.


  Incorporate web-grounded context: CI/CD definitions (OWASP Cheat Sheet), security gates as checkpoints, DevSecOps, OWASP
  Top 10 CI/CD risks, SLSA (Levels 0-4: Insecure to High Integrity; focuses on tamper-evidence, provenance), OWASP SPVS maturity.
  Examples: SAST (static), DAST (dynamic), SCA (software composition), GitHub Actions/Jenkins integrations.


  Voter consensus (100%): Emphasize Bloom''s progression, discussion trade-offs (auto vs. manual), peer teaching OWASP risks,
  problem-solving pipelines, full SLSA details.


  Generate flashcards strictly in the flashcard_schema format as JSON array of objects. Ensure active learning ties (e.g.,
  explanations reference debates/exercises). Cover prior knowledge (CI/CD basics) and big picture (secure velocity, supply
  chain prevention). Output only the JSON array, no extra text.'
