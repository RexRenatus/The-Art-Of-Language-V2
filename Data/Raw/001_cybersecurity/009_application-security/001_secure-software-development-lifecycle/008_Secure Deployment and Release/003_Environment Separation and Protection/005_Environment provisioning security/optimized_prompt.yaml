active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios might Infrastructure as Code (IaC) introduce more security risks than manual provisioning,
    and vice versa? Use real-world examples like the Capital One breach (misconfigured IaC leading to data exposure) or Twitter's
    configuration error to debate the role of automation in DevSecOps and challenge misconceptions like 'IaC is always secure'.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions (e.g., ''IaC eliminates all
    manual errors'' vs. reality: introduces code propagation risks; ''Manual provisioning is always slower but secure'' vs.
    human error risks). Use partial truths, opposites, or unrelated standards (e.g., mix NIST with OWASP). Ensure distractors
    promote critical thinking.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator synthesizing university-level pedagogy for ''Environment Provisioning
  Security'' (Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Secure Software Development Lifecycle > Secure 009_Deployment and
  Release > Environment Separation and Protection > Environment provisioning security). Use Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives:
  [insert learning_objectives array]. Incorporate active learning: [insert active_learning object]. Follow scaffolding layers:
  [insert scaffolding array]. Align to voter consensus (82.9% approval): pedagogy, measurable outcomes, CIS/NIST completeness,
  engagement. Research context: Environment provisioning secures infrastructure (IaC, DevSecOps) from inception; standards
  include NIST CSF 2.0 (Govern), CIS Controls (e.g., 5.1 Secure Configs, least privilege); best practices: automated scans,
  no shared creds, immutable infra; examples: Capital One IaC breach.


  Generate 75 flashcards covering all layers/objectives (20% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 30% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4; span all Bloom''s
  levels). Use schema: [insert flashcard_schema.structure]. Vary types: 40% basic Q&A, 40% MCQ, 20% cloze. Distractors per
  protocol. Explanations comprehensive. Prioritize prior knowledge links (SDLC/DevOps). Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards.
  Ensure measurable, active-learning tied, misconception-busting content.'
