active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the risks of using shared credentials across dev, test, and prod environments
    (e.g., a dev credential leak compromising production). How do environment-specific credentials, per NIST SP 800-63, address
    these? Connect to prior knowledge of environment separation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
