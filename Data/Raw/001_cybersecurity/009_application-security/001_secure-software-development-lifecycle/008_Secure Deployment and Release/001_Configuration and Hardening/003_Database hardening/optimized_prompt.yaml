active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of implementing strict database hardening measures (e.g.,
    disabling unused services vs. operational performance). How does it fit into the broader SDLC deployment phase and defense-in-depth
    strategy? Reference CIS Benchmarks and provide real-world examples from breaches like the Equifax incident.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
