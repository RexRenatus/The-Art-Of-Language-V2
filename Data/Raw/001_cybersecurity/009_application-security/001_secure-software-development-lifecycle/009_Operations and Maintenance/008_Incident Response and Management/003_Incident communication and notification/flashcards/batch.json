        "core_logic": "SP 800-61 Rev. 3 shifts focus from detailed procedural steps (as in Rev. 2) to integrating incident response within broader cybersecurity risk management (like CSF 2.0), because the pace of technological change makes static, comprehensive procedural guides impractical.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors propose incorrect scope changes related to cloud/on-prem, legal details, or document types, failing to grasp the fundamental shift towards risk management integration and acknowledging the limitations of static procedural documentation.",
        "analogy": "Rev. 2 was like a detailed user manual for a specific car model, while Rev. 3 is more like a guide on how to maintain any vehicle effectively within the broader context of transportation safety."
