active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether digital forensics should prioritize speed over thoroughness during incident
    response, using NIST SP 800-86 as a reference. Identify key trade-offs, such as evidence admissibility risks versus time-sensitive
    containment needs, and support with real-world examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    with hashing only). (2) Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., forensic imaging as ''simple copy-paste''). (3) Related
    but wrong concept (e.g., mix up NIST SP 800-86 phases with general IR). Base on lower Bloom''s errors; ensure plausible

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Digital Forensics and
  Investigation'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Secure Software Development Lifecycle > 010_Operations
  and Maintenance > 014_002_Incident Response and Management > Digital Forensics and Investigation). Use the provided scaffolding
  layers as primary source material, progressing from foundation to integration. Align flashcards to these Bloom''s objectives:
  [insert learning_objectives array here]. Incorporate active learning hooks referencing discussion (speed vs. thoroughness),
  peer teaching (chain of custody scenarios), and problem-solving (log analysis).


  Generate 40 high-quality flashcards (10 per scaffolding layer) optimized for Anki/spaced repetition: promote active recall,
  vary difficulty. Follow EXACTLY the flashcard_schema: 60% basic, 40% MCQ with distractor_protocol. Ensure measurable action
  verbs, prior knowledge anchors (e.g., ''Building on incident detection...''), and big-picture ties (SDLC feedback, compliance).


  Output ONLY a JSON array matching the schema''s output_format. No extra text.'
