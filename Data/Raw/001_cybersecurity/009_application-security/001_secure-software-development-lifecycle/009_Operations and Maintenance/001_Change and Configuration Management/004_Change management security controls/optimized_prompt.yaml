  discussion_prompt: 'Evaluate the SolarWinds supply chain hack: What change management security controls (e.g., NIST CM-3)
    were likely missing or bypassed? Discuss why ''minor changes don''t need review'' is a dangerous misconception and propose
    preventive measures in a group debate.'
  peer_teaching: In pairs, select one NIST SP 800-53 control (e.g., CM-3 Configuration Change Control) and teach it to your
    partner using a personal or hypothetical example. Switch roles and provide feedback on clarity and application.
  problem_solving: 'Simulate a Change Advisory Board (CAB) meeting: Review a software patch request (provide scenario: emergency
    update with untested code). Assess risks, apply controls (risk assessment, testing), vote to approve/reject, and justify
    with NIST references. Use think-pair-share to debrief misconceptions.'

  **Content Sources (complete research):** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r5): CM-2 Baseline
  Configuration (establish/monitor baselines), CM-3 Configuration Change Control (plan/test/approve/document changes). NIST
  SP 800-53A Rev 5 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53Ar5): Assessment procedures (e.g., CM-3: Verify processes, test
  changes). Other: ITIL change mgmt, DevSecOps, SolarWinds case. Prerequisites: SDLC, config mgmt, risk assessment.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list from above].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Weave references (e.g., SolarWinds discussion, CAB role-play) into explanations.


  **Scaffolding:** Distribute cards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4. [Insert full scaffolding details].


  **Concept Map:** Use in explanations: Central ''Change Mgmt Security Controls'' → NIST CM family → Risk/Vuln → CAB/Steps
  → DevSecOps.


  **Output:** JSON array of objects matching flashcard_schema. Ensure variety, no duplicates, comprehensive coverage. Cards
  promote active recall, spaced repetition best practices.'
