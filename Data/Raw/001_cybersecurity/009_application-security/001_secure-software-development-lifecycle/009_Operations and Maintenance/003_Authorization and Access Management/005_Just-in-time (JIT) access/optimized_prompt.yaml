active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a high-availability cloud environment, debate the trade-offs between JIT access and standing privileges.
    Consider factors like operational downtime, compliance requirements, and insider threat mitigation. Support your position
    with real-world examples from Azure PIM or AWS IAM.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
