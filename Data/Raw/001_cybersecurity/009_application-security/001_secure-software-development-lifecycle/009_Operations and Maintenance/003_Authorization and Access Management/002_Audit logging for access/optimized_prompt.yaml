active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a zero-trust environment, how does audit logging for access contribute to threat detection and regulatory
    compliance? Debate the trade-offs between detailed logging (e.g., including IP sources) and performance overhead, using
    real-world examples like a data breach scenario.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse audit with app logs),
    2) Partial truth (e.g., missing one component), 3) Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., ''logs everything'' vs. security-relevant).
    Base on voter suggestions/web research for realism.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Topic: ''Audit logging for access'' (Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Secure Software Development Lifecycle > 010_Operations and Maintenance > Authorization
  and 002_Access Management > Audit logging for access). Use the provided learning_objectives, active_learning, scaffolding_layers
  (progress from Layer 1 Foundation to Layer 4 Integration), and flashcard_schema exactly.


  Prioritize voter consensus: Full Bloom''s coverage, prior knowledge links, 4-layer structure, NIST SP 800-92/OWASP/CIS details,
  best practices (immutability/encryption/retention/SIEM), big picture (zero-trust/threat detection/compliance), concrete
  JSON examples.


  Research context: Audit logs are security records of access events (timestamp/user/action/object/outcome/source). Differs
  from app logs. Standards: NIST 800-92 (log mgmt), OWASP Logging Cheat Sheet, CIS benchmarks.


  Generate flashcards following flashcard_schema. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards. Ensure active learning integration
  (e.g., explanations reference discussions). Balance: 10-15 per layer, spanning Bloom''s levels. High-quality, measurable,
  engaging for university pedagogy.'
