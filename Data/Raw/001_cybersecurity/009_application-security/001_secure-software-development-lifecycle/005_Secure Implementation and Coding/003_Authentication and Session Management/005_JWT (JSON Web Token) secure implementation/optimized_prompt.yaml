active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages of stateless JWT authentication over traditional stateful
    sessions in microservices architectures. Consider scalability, security trade-offs (e.g., token revocation challenges),
    and real-world scenarios like API gateways. Reference RFC 8725 best practices to support arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    for performance'', ''Valid for internal use'', ''Deprecated but safe''). Ensure distractors are realistic (from OWASP/JWT
    attacks), reference research context pitfalls. Avoid obvious wrongs.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Topic: JWT (JSON Web Token) secure implementation (Category: Cybersecurity,
  Domain: 008_Application Security, Subdomain: Secure Software Development Lifecycle, Entry: 006_Secure Implementation and
  Coding / Authentication and 005_Session Management).


  **Context:** JWTs are compact, URL-safe tokens for stateless auth in APIs/microservices. Structure: Base64URL(header.payload.signature).
  Claims: iss, sub, aud, exp, iat. Secure per RFC 8725: no ''none'' alg, validate claims, strong keys/HTTPS, no sensitive
  data. Sources: RFC 7519 (JWT), RFC 8725 (Best Practices), IANA JSON Web Token Registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml),
  OWASP JWT Cheat Sheet.
