  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the following: ''Self-signed certificates are sufficient for internal use and do not require
    full PKI management.'' Use real-world examples like the DigiNotar breach to support your position, addressing common misconceptions
    about certificate expiration and trust chains.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Certificate management\
  \ and PKI (topic_hierarchy: ['Cybersecurity', '008_Application Security', 'Secure Software Development Lifecycle', '006_Secure\
  \ Implementation and Coding', '010_Cryptographic Implementation', 'Certificate management and PKI']). Use university pedagogy:\
  \ Bloom's Taxonomy, active learning, 4-layer scaffolding (Foundation, Components, Implementation, Integration). Incorporate\
  \ voter consensus: full PKI components (Root/Intermediate CA, RA, Repository, CRL/OCSP), lifecycle management, misconceptions\
  \ (self-signed security, no expiration), real-world (DigiNotar), HSM/cert-manager/zero-trust integration. Prior knowledge:\
  \ cryptographic basics.\n\nLearning objectives: [REMEMBER: Define PKI/components; UNDERSTAND: Explain trust; APPLY: Lifecycle\
  \ steps; ANALYZE: Compare CAs/CRL-OCSP; EVALUATE: Risks like expiration/breaches; CREATE: Design policy].\n\nGenerate flashcards\
  \ covering all objectives/layers balanced. Each flashcard MUST follow this EXACT JSON schema:\n{\n  \"question\": \"...\"\
