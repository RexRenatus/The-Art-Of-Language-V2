active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios might digital signatures fail to provide non-repudiation (e.g., compromised private
    keys or weak key management), and how can attackers exploit these? Debate mitigation strategies such as Hardware Security
    Modules (HSMs) or key rotation policies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Related but incorrect concept (e.g., ''use hash directly without signing''); 3) Edge case error (e.g., ''verify with
    private key''). Ensure distractors test deeper understanding without being obvious.'

  **Prerequisites:** Students know basic hashing (SHA family) and public-key cryptography from prior subdomain.


  **Research Context:** Digital signatures ensure authenticity, integrity, non-repudiation via hashing + asymmetric crypto.
  Process: 1) Hash message; 2) Encrypt hash with private key (signature); 3) Verify: Re-hash + decrypt sig with public key
  + compare. Standards: NIST FIPS 186-5 (2023, DSA/RSA/ECDSA); NIST SP 800-63-4 (draft 2024, identity guidelines referencing
  signatures). Common issues: Key compromise, weak hashes (e.g., MD5). Sources: NIST FIPS 186-5 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.186-5),
  SP 800-63 (https://pages.nist.gov/800-63/), OpenSSL docs.
