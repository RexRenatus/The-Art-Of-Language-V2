active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of relying on OSS (e.g., speed vs. risks like Log4Shell).
    How does SCA address these, and what limitations does it have compared to manual code reviews? Support with statistics
    on OSS usage (90%+ of apps) and voter consensus on its importance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [paste full list above].

  - Active learning: Use for context/inspiration.

  - Scaffolding: Generate flashcards balanced across 4 layers [paste full scaffolding content].

  - Research: OSS=80-90% code, Log4Shell CVE-2021-44228, tools=Snyk/Dependabot/FOSSA/Mend/SonarSource, EO 14028, SBOM.

  - Voters: Why SCA important (security/license/ops), examples, prior knowledge links.


  Generate 25 flashcards in exact JSON array format per schema [paste full schema description/example]. Ensure:

  - Questions test progression: Remember facts, Understand why, Apply steps, Analyze compare, Evaluate critique, Create plans.

  - Distractors: Exactly 3 per card, plausible (e.g., common misconceptions like ''OSS is safe''), with explanations.

  - Coverage: 20% per layer, span objectives.

  - Educational: Explanations reference stats/examples/sources.

  Output ONLY the JSON array, no extra text.'
