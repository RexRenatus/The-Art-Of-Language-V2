        "core_logic": "An SBOM aids risk management because it provides a definitive inventory, enabling rapid identification of the vulnerable component and assessment of its widespread use across the application portfolio.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors propose actions (automatic patching, source code provision, library regeneration) that are outside the scope and capability of an SBOM, which primarily serves as an inventory and transparency tool.",
        "analogy": "If a food recall happens for an ingredient, an SBOM is like checking your pantry and all your recipes to see exactly where that ingredient was used, allowing you to take targeted action."
