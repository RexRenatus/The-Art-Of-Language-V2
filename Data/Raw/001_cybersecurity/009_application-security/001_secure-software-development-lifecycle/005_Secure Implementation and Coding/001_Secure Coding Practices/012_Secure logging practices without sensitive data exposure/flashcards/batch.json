      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The recommended approach for PII is data minimization and robust protection if logging is unavoidable, because PII is highly sensitive and subject to privacy regulations. This functions by balancing the need for audit trails with the imperative to protect individual privacy.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors suggest logging all PII, logging it insecurely, or using inadequate temporary storage, all of which violate best practices for handling sensitive data.",
        "analogy": "It's like deciding whether to keep a diary of someone's personal life: only do it if essential, and if you do, keep it locked and perhaps use a code."
