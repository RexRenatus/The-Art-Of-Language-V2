active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of accruing security debt in a startup versus an enterprise environment. When is
    it justified (e.g., tight deadlines), what are the long-term costs (e.g., breach risks like Equifax), and how do frameworks
    like OWASP SAMM or BSIMM guide decisions? Support arguments with risk prioritization examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate high-quality Anki-style flashcards
  on ''Security Debt Management'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Secure Software Development
  Lifecycle > 003_Secure SDLC Lifecycle Management > Application Lifecycle Management > Security Debt Management). Use the
  provided learning objectives, active learning activities, 4-layer scaffolding, and research context below. Ensure cards
  promote Bloom''s progression, active recall, spaced repetition, and spaced practice via distractors.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert array from above]


  **Active Learning:** [Insert object from above] – Tie explanations to these for application.


  **Scaffolding:** [Insert array from above] – Distribute cards across layers.


  **Research Context:** Security debt: implied rework cost from security shortcuts. Core: Security debt (subset of technical
  debt); Vulnerability; Risk mgmt. Frameworks: NIST CSF 2.0 (assess/prioritize risks); NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2 RMF (7 steps
  integrating security into SDLC, continuous monitoring remediates debt); OWASP SAMM (maturity for assurance); BSIMM (real-world
  security metrics). Sources: nist.gov/cyberframework, csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/37/r2, owasp.org/www-project-samm, bsimm.com.
  Case: Equifax (unpatched vulns as debt).


  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly follow formats, distractor protocol, explanation requirements, and coverage from above. Output
  as JSON array: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...''}]. Vary difficulty; include hierarchy links in
  20% cards. No duplicates; optimize for retention.'
