active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group, debate the ethical implications of continuing to use EOL software in critical infrastructure
    (e.g., hospitals or power grids) versus the costs of migration. Consider real-world cases like WannaCry exploiting unpatched
    EOL systems and propose balanced risk mitigation strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., ''Patches are always instant fixes'' for patch mgmt questions).'
    - 'Distractor 2: Confusable term (e.g., EOL vs. EOS; vuln mgmt vs. patch mgmt).'
    - 'Distractor 3: Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''SCRM only applies to hardware'' ignoring software supply chains).'
    - Base on real-world failures (WannaCry for EOL risks) or voter-noted misconceptions.
    - Ensure plausibility for university-level learners; avoid obvious errors.
    quantity: 'Generate 40-50 flashcards: 10 per Bloom''s pair (Remember/Understand, Apply/Analyze, Evaluate/Create), distributed
      across scaffolding layers.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  using Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, and scaffolding. Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards on ''Version Lifecycle
  Security Management'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity (L1) > 008_Application Security (L2) > Secure Software Development Lifecycle
  (L3) > 003_Secure SDLC Lifecycle Management (L4) > Application Lifecycle Management (L5) > Version lifecycle security management

  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding layers: [INSERT FULL LAYERS FROM ABOVE]

  - Active learning for context: [INSERT FULL ACTIVE LEARNING FROM ABOVE]

  - Real-world examples: WannaCry (EOL risks), Log4Shell (patch failures).

  - NIST SP 800-40 Rev. 4: Patch mgmt processes (inventory, assess, prioritize, test/deploy, verify).


  Use EXACT flashcard schema:

  Front: Question with 4 MC options (A-D, 1 correct).

  Back: JSON object with ''correct_answer'' (e.g., ''A: Explanation''), ''explanation'' (link to layer/objective/example),
  ''references'' (Bloom''s/layer/NIST), ''misconception_addressed''.


  Follow distractor protocol strictly. Ensure completeness, engagement, and prior knowledge links to SDLC. Output as numbered
  list of Front/Back pairs in markdown format for easy import (e.g., Anki). Vary difficulty across Bloom''s levels.'
