    Use OWASP Top 10 risks and SAMM maturity model to argue positions, considering real-world factors like cost, criticality,
    and a survey stat that 70% of organizations have legacy systems.'

    - 'Plausible but incorrect: From common misconceptions (e.g., confuse SAMM with Top 10), partial truths (e.g., ''patch
      immediately'' vs. ''EoL unpatchable''), or research context variants (e.g., modern app strategy for legacy risk).'
    - 'Avoid: Obvious wrongs, unrelated terms.'
    - 'Balance: 1 semantic (close meaning), 1 superficial (similar acronym), 1 foil (opposite/extreme).'
    example:
      question: Primary risk of EoL legacy apps?

      - Excessive logging

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Legacy Application Security''
  (Category: Cybersecurity, Domain: 008_Application Security, Subdomain: Secure Software Development Lifecycle, Entry Domain:
  003_Secure SDLC Lifecycle Management, Entry Subdomain: Application Lifecycle Management; Level 6 in hierarchy).


  **Research Context (Incorporate Fully):** Legacy apps are outdated software in active use, risking unpatched vulns, no vendor
  support (EoL), skilled personnel shortages, SIEM incompatibilities. Frameworks: OWASP Top 10 (risk awareness), SAMM (maturity
  assessment), Legacy Application Management Cheat Sheet (strategies: network segmentation/isolation, enhanced monitoring,
  API wrappers, gradual refactoring, migration roadmaps). Big picture: 70% orgs have legacy systems; links to Secure SDLC
  phases.


  **Learning Objectives (Align Cards):** [Insert the 6 objectives above].


  **Scaffolding (Distribute Cards Evenly):** [Insert the 4 layers above].


  **Active Learning Inspiration:** Draw from discussion (retire vs. secure debate), peer teaching (EoL risks vs. SAMM), problem-solving
  (hospital 1990s app scenario) for scenario/mcq cards.


  **Output Format:** JSON array of objects, strictly following flashcard_schema. Generate 50 cards: 12 Layer1 (mostly remember/understand),
  13 Layer2 (understand/apply), 13 Layer3 (apply/analyze), 12 Layer4 (analyze/evaluate/create). Mix types, ensure voter consensus
  (100% approval: completeness with OWASP details, pedagogy via Bloom''s, engagement via scenarios). Verify accuracy/links
  (e.g., owasp.org/Top10, SAMM). No duplicates; optimize for retention.'
