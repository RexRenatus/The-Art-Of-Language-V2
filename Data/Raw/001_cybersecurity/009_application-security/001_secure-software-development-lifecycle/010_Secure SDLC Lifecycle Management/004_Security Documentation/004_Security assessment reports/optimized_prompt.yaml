  discussion_prompt: 'Evaluate a sample security assessment report: What elements make it effective or deficient in communicating
    risks and remediation? Debate using NIST SP 800-53A Rev. 5 guidelines and NIST CSF 2.0 outcomes. Consider how well it
    aligns with the NIST RMF (SP 800-37 Rev. 2) ''Assess'' and ''Authorize'' steps.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Application Security and\
  \ Secure SDLC. Generate 20-30 high-quality flashcards on 'Security assessment reports' (Topic Hierarchy: Level 1: Cybersecurity\
  \ | Level 2: 008_Application Security | Level 3: Secure Software Development Lifecycle | Level 4: 003_Secure SDLC Lifecycle\
  \ Management | Level 5: Security Documentation | Level 6: Security assessment reports).\n\nIncorporate these elements:\n\
  - Learning Objectives: Cover all 6 Bloom's levels provided (Remember to Create).\n- Scaffolding: Distribute cards across\
  \ 4 layers (Foundation, Components, Implementation, Integration).\n- Active Learning: Draw from discussion, peer teaching,\
  \ problem-solving for scenario-based cards.\n- Research Context: NIST CSF 2.0 (risk-based outcomes), NIST SP 800-53A Rev.\
  \ 5 (control assessments), NIST RMF SP 800-37 Rev. 2 (Assess/Authorize steps), CVSS scoring, common vulns (SQLi, XSS).\n\
  - Prerequisites: Link to SDLC phases and basic vulnerabilities.\n\nUse EXACTLY this schema for each card in JSON array:\n\
