        "core_logic": "Using contractual clauses like EULAs to disclaim liability for certain types of losses is a form of risk transfer, shifting the financial burden of specific risks to the user or another party.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Mitigation involves reducing the risk itself, acceptance is acknowledging it without action, and avoidance is preventing the activity. Transfer uses agreements to shift consequences.",
        "analogy": "Transfer is like a landlord putting a clause in a lease stating the tenant is responsible for minor repairs, shifting the burden of those specific costs."
