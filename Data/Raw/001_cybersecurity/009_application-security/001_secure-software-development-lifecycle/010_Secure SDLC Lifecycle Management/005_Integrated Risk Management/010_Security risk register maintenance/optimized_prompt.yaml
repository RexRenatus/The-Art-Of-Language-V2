active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a fast-paced agile development environment, how should teams balance the frequency of security risk
    register updates with sprint deadlines? Debate the pros and cons of daily, weekly, or milestone-based updates, and propose
    a hybrid schedule using NIST SP 800-37 Rev 2 guidelines for continuous monitoring. Support your position with examples
    from application security risks like zero-day vulnerabilities.
  peer_teaching: Students pair up. Partner A explains the core components of a security risk register (risk ID, likelihood,
    impact, mitigation status, owner per NIST SP 800-30) using a sample entry from an application security context (e.g.,
    SQL injection risk). Partner B listens, asks clarifying questions, then 'teaches back' by creating and explaining their
    own example (e.g., XSS vulnerability). Switch roles and discuss integration into SDLC phases.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A deployed web application faces a new zero-day vulnerability similar to Log4Shell. Provide
    students with a partially completed risk register template (including existing risks). In small groups, students: 1) Identify
    and add the new risk; 2) Reassess likelihood/impact for related entries; 3) Prioritize mitigations (e.g., patching, monitoring);
    4) Track changes and assign owners. Collaborate via shared document and present updates, justifying decisions against
    NIST frameworks.'

  **Content Base**: Use this exact scaffolding (4 layers), research context (NIST SP 800-30 Rev1: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-30r1.pdf;
  NIST SP 800-37 Rev2: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-37r2.pdf; Sources: OWASP Risk Rating,
  ISO 27005), objectives, and active learning for context/depth.

  **Generation Rules**:

  - Distribute: 10 per layer, balanced Bloom''s (per objectives).

  - Schema: [Insert flashcard_schema here]. Mix types; always MCQ with distractors.

  - Pedagogical: Tie to objectives (tag Bloom''s), scaffold (reference layer), inspire active learning (e.g., ''How would
  you apply this in peer teaching?'').

  - Optimized: Spaced repetition friendly (active recall), measurable (e.g., ''List 3 triggers'').

  - Output: JSON array of flashcards, each: {''type'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''1-4'', ''bloom'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'',
  ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''hints'': [...], ''source'': ''...''}}. No duplicates; comprehensive
  coverage.'
