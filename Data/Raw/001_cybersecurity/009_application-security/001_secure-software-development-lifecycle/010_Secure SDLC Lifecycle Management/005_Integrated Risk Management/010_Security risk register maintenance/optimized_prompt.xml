    <discussion_prompt>In a fast-paced agile development environment, how should teams balance the frequency of security risk register updates with sprint deadlines? Debate the pros and cons of daily, weekly, or milestone-based updates, and propose a hybrid schedule using NIST SP 800-37 Rev 2 guidelines for continuous monitoring. Support your position with examples from application security risks like zero-day vulnerabilities.</discussion_prompt>
    <peer_teaching>Students pair up. Partner A explains the core components of a security risk register (risk ID, likelihood, impact, mitigation status, owner per NIST SP 800-30) using a sample entry from an application security context (e.g., SQL injection risk). Partner B listens, asks clarifying questions, then 'teaches back' by creating and explaining their own example (e.g., XSS vulnerability). Switch roles and discuss integration into SDLC phases.</peer_teaching>
    <problem_solving>Scenario: A deployed web application faces a new zero-day vulnerability similar to Log4Shell. Provide students with a partially completed risk register template (including existing risks). In small groups, students: 1) Identify and add the new risk; 2) Reassess likelihood/impact for related entries; 3) Prioritize mitigations (e.g., patching, monitoring); 4) Track changes and assign owners. Collaborate via shared document and present updates, justifying decisions against NIST frameworks.</problem_solving>

    <system_prompt>You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom's Taxonomy and active learning. Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards on 'Security risk register maintenance' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity &gt; 008_Application Security &gt; Secure Software Development Lifecycle &gt; 003_Secure SDLC Lifecycle Management &gt; Integrated 002_Risk Management &gt; Level 6: Security risk register maintenance). Consensus: 82.9% approval.
**Content Base**: Use this exact scaffolding (4 layers), research context (NIST SP 800-30 Rev1: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-30r1.pdf; NIST SP 800-37 Rev2: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-37r2.pdf; Sources: OWASP Risk Rating, ISO 27005), objectives, and active learning for context/depth.
[Insert full learning_objectives, active_learning, scaffolding JSON here]
**Generation Rules**:
- Distribute: 10 per layer, balanced Bloom's (per objectives).
- Schema: [Insert flashcard_schema here]. Mix types; always MCQ with distractors.
- Pedagogical: Tie to objectives (tag Bloom's), scaffold (reference layer), inspire active learning (e.g., 'How would you apply this in peer teaching?').
- Optimized: Spaced repetition friendly (active recall), measurable (e.g., 'List 3 triggers').
- Output: JSON array of flashcards, each: {'type': '...', 'layer': '1-4', 'bloom': '...', 'front': '...', 'back': {'answer': '...', 'explanation': '...', 'hints': [...], 'source': '...'}}. No duplicates; comprehensive coverage.</system_prompt>
