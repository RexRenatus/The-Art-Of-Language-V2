        "core_logic": "NIST SP 800-218 focuses on mitigating risk because completely eliminating all vulnerabilities is often impractical, but reducing their number and impact is achievable. The SSDF functions by embedding security practices into the development process, thereby preventing many vulnerabilities from being introduced and making those that do occur easier to manage.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors propose unattainable goals (elimination), ineffective strategies (post-release patching only), or unethical approaches (risk transfer), missing the SSDF's core objective of proactive risk mitigation.",
        "analogy": "Mitigating vulnerability risk is like building a sturdy fence around a property to prevent unauthorized entry, rather than just reacting after a break-in occurs."
