active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the impact of human error on software security breaches and evaluate how
    NIST SP 800-50 Rev. 1's CPLP lifecycle addresses this compared to traditional one-off training sessions. Support your
    arguments with examples from real-world breaches.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    similar terms like ''Cyber Hygiene'' vs. ''Cyber Security'' without hygiene specifics; outdated NIST phases). Ensure 1
    distractor is a near-miss (e.g., original SP 800-50 phase), 1 overly broad, 1 unrelated but thematic. Avoid ''all/none''
    options.'
