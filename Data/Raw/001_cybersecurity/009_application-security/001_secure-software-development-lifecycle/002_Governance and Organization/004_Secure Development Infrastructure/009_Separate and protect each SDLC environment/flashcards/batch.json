        "core_logic": "CI/CD pipelines automate code movement through SDLC environments. To maintain security, these pipelines must be secured with robust access controls and automated checks. This ensures that code progresses logically and securely from development to testing to production, preventing unauthorized or unvalidated code from reaching live systems. This works by enforcing policy gates within the automation.",

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The security focus differs significantly between SDLC environments because their purposes are distinct. Development environments are sandboxes for creation, where flexibility is key, and risks are contained. Production environments, however, host live data and users, making stability, confidentiality, and integrity paramount. This works by tailoring security measures to the specific risks and objectives of each stage.",
