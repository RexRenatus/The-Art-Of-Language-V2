active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using IAST versus SAST/DAST in a high-velocity CI/CD
    pipeline. Justify your position with examples from OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and real-world compliance scenarios like
    PCI-DSS.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 2-4 plausible distractors per MCQ: (1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''IAST is static analysis''
    for SAST confusion), (2) Partial truths (e.g., ''Monitors only source code'' omitting runtime), (3) Edge cases (e.g.,
    tools or standards from similar domains), (4) Avoid obvious wrongs. Ensure distractors test Bloom''s progression (e.g.,
    remember facts, analyze comparisons).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Interactive Application
  Security Testing (IAST) within the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Secure Software Development
  Lifecycle > 008_Security Testing and Verification > Dynamic Analysis and Runtime Testing > Interactive 008_006_Application
  Security Testing (IAST).


  Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives [insert learning_objectives array], active learning activities
  [insert active_learning object], 4-layer scaffolding [insert scaffolding array]. Use research context: IAST uses embedded
  sensors for runtime monitoring during interactive tests, detects vulns real-time, advantages over SAST (false positives,
  no runtime) and DAST (code access). Prior knowledge: SAST/DAST/SDLC. Big Picture: Shift-left, zero-trust, PCI-DSS. Standards:
  OWASP Testing Guide, ASVS, Top 10. Sources: OWASP.org, Contrast Security, Synopsys.


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (20 basic Q&A, 20 MCQ, 10 cloze) covering all scaffolding layers proportionally (Layer
  1: 20%, Layer 2: 25%, Layer 3: 25%, Layer 4: 30%). Ensure progression: 30% remember/understand, 30% apply/analyze, 40% evaluate/create.


  Output strictly JSON array of flashcards, each as: {''type'': ''basic|mcq|cloze'', ''layer'': 1-4, ''blooms_level'': ''remember|understand|apply|analyze|evaluate|create'',
  ''question|front_text'': ''...'', ''answer|back_text|correct_answer'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'', ...]
  (MCQ only), ''explanation'': ''...''}.


  Follow flashcard_schema precisely: plausible distractors, detailed explanations with pedagogy ties.'
