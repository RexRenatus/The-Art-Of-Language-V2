active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how DAST enables 'shift-left' security in the Secure Software Development
    Lifecycle (SDLC). Consider its role in reducing production risks compared to manual penetration testing, and share examples
    from OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities like SQLi and XSS. What challenges arise in CI/CD integration, and how can they be mitigated?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    access'' for black-box confusion); (2) Related but incorrect concepts (e.g., SAST tools as DAST options); (3) Partial
    truths (e.g., ''Only for static code'' vs. runtime); (4) Edge cases (e.g., false positives as ''always accurate''). Ensure
    distractors promote analysis.'

  consensus: 82.9% approval; priorities include completeness (best practices: frequency/scope/tools/false positives/reporting),
  pedagogy (Bloom''s progression, scaffolding), problem-solving (OWASP Juice Shop), integration (shift-left, SAST combo).

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [REMEMBER: Define DAST... CREATE: Design strategy...]

  - Scaffolding: Layer 1 Foundation (concepts/prior knowledge), Layer 2 Components (standards/tools), Layer 3 Implementation
  (best practices/CI/CD), Layer 4 Integration (DevSecOps/shift-left).

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to discussion (shift-left), peer teaching (tools), problem-solving (Juice Shop scans).


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards following this schema:

  - Variety: 30% basic Q&A, 40% MCQ (4 options), 15% cloze, 15% scenario.

  - Front: Engaging question.

  - Back: {answer: ''...'', explanation: ''... (why correct/distractors, Bloom''s/scaffolding tie-in)'', references: ''...''}

  - Distractors: Plausible misconceptions (e.g., SAST confusion).

  - Ensure progressive difficulty: 20% Layer1/Remember, 30% Layer2/Understand-Analyze, 30% Layer3/Apply, 20% Layer4/Evaluate-Create.

  - Optimize for Anki/spaced repetition: Concise, active recall.


  Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}, ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''...''}]. Cover all voter
