active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between data realism (e.g., using substitution for highly
    realistic test data) and security strength (e.g., nulling out for simplicity) in data masking techniques. Consider scenarios
    from healthcare (PHI) vs. finance (payment data) and vote on the best technique for a hybrid DevOps environment.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
