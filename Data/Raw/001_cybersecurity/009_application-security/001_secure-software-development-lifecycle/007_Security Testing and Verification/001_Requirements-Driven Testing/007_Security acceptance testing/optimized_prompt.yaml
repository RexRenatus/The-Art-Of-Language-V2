active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss how SAT serves as the final security gate in zero-trust architectures and contributes to compliance
    (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS). Share real-world examples of SAT failures leading to breaches and propose mitigations using OWASP
    WSTG categories.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  (SAT) per topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Secure Software Development Lifecycle > 008_Security
  Testing and Verification > Requirements-Driven Testing > Security acceptance testing. Voter consensus: 84.3% approval on
  completeness (full OWASP WSTG v4 4.1-4.15), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression, 4-layer scaffolding), active learning, big picture
  (SAT as pre-deployment gate for zero-trust/compliance), misconceptions, prior knowledge (SDLC/UAT links).

  Incorporate provided learning_objectives, active_learning activities, scaffolding layers, and flashcard_schema exactly.
  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (10 per schema type, balanced Bloom''s). Ensure completeness: Cover all OWASP categories
  explicitly (e.g., 4.8 Error Handling: test stack traces; 4.9 Business Logic: workflow bypasses; 4.10 Client-Side: DOM XSS;
  4.11 API: auth bypass). Use concept map logic. Output ONLY in JSON: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...''}].
