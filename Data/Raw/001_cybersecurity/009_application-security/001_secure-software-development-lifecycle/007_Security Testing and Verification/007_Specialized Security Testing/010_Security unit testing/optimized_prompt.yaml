learning_objectives:
  analyze:
  - objective: Compare security unit testing with other phases like integration testing, SAST, or DAST, identifying strengths
      and limitations.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  create:
  - objective: Design a comprehensive security unit test suite for a module (e.g., login handler) covering multiple OWASP
      categories and integrating into CI/CD.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  remember:
  - objective: Define security unit testing and recall key OWASP WSTG categories relevant to it (e.g., IVT, AUT, ATH, SST,
      CRYP, Client-side Testing).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  understand:
  - objective: Explain the integration of security unit testing into the Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and
      its extension from standard unit testing.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  evaluate:
  - objective: Critique the effectiveness and coverage of a given security unit test suite, assessing risk mitigation for
      high-risk code units.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Implement a security unit test for a code snippet vulnerable to common issues like SQL injection (IVT) or weak
      cryptography (CRYP) using tools like JUnit or Pytest.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security Unit Testing (topic
  hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Secure Software Development Lifecycle > 008_Security Testing and Verification
  > Specialized Security Testing > Security unit testing). Use the provided learning objectives (spanning Bloom''s Taxonomy:
  remember/understand, apply/analyze, evaluate/create), active learning components (discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving),
  4 scaffolding layers (Foundation > Components > Implementation > Integration), and flashcard schema.


  Generate 40-60 high-quality flashcards covering:

  - All Bloom''s levels (10-15% remember, 20% understand, 30% apply/analyze, 20% evaluate, 20% create).

  - All scaffolding layers proportionally.

  - OWASP WSTG categories comprehensively: INFO, CFG, IDM, AUT, ATH, SST, IVT, ERR, CRYP, BLT, Client-side Testing (complete
  with examples like DOM XSS prevention).

  - Voter priorities: Completeness (full WSTG adaptation, client-side), pedagogy (tie to activities).

  - Sources: OWASP WSTG, NIST.


  Output ONLY in JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"type": "mcq/cloze/etc.", "front": "...", "back": "...", "bloom_level":
  "apply", "layer": "3_implementation", "explanation": "Detailed... with distractor rationale, OWASP ref, real-world tie-in."}.


  Ensure active learning integration (e.g., MCQs on debate points), distractors per protocol (plausible errors), explanations
  per requirements. Make engaging, university-level, with code snippets where apt (e.g., Python/Javascript). Balance formats.'
