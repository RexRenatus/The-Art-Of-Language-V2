        "core_logic": "Regulatory compliance (like HIPAA or PCI-DSS) mandates specific protections for sensitive data. Asset Classification is the first step, identifying what data needs protection and its sensitivity level. This directly informs the selection and implementation of appropriate security controls required by these standards. This works by aligning security measures with legal and regulatory obligations, because non-compliance carries significant penalties.",
        "distractor_analysis": "While all principles are important, Asset Classification directly addresses the foundational requirement for understanding and protecting regulated data, which is central to compliance.",
        "analogy": "It's like a lawyer needing to understand the specific laws (asset classification) before they can advise on the correct legal procedures (security controls) to follow."
