active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages of SAMM's risk-driven and evolutive approach over rigid
    checklists for Agile/DevOps teams. Provide examples from real-world breaches where SAMM practices could have mitigated
    risks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Core Content (ensure completeness):

  - SAMM: Maturity model for software security posture; risk-driven, evolutive, tech/process agnostic, holistic SDLC.

  - 5 Business Functions (e.g., Governance, Design, Implementation, Verification, Operations); each has 3 streams (Strategy,
  Tactics, Enablement); 3-4 security practices per stream (total ~12-15 detailed practices, e.g., Governance: Security Strategy,
  Policy, Education).

  - Maturity Levels: 0 (Implicit/Ad-hoc), 1 (Initial), 2 (Managed), 3 (Optimized/Measured).

  - Assessment: Spreadsheets for scoring, roadmaps for improvement.

  - Integrations: NIST SSDF (practices alignment), ISO 27001 (governance), PCI-DSS (verification), EO 14028.

  - Prior Knowledge: SDLC basics, threat modeling, standards.
