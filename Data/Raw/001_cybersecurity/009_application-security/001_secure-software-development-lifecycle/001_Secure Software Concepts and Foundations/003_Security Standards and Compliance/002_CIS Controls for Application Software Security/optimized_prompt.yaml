active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss how failures in application software security, as seen in the Equifax breach (2017), could have
    been mitigated by implementing CIS Control 16 safeguards. What SSDLC phase gaps were evident, and how does CIS Control
    16 address them compared to NIST SSDF?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
