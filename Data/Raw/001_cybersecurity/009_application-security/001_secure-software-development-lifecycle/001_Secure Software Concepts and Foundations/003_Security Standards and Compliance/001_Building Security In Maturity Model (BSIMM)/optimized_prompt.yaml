learning_objectives:
  analyze:
  - objective: Compare BSIMM to other frameworks like OWASP SAMM and NIST SSDF, identifying overlaps and unique strengths.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  create:
  - objective: Design an improvement plan for a hypothetical SSI, selecting BSIMM practices across domains to advance from
      emerging to optimizing maturity.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  remember:
  - objective: Define BSIMM and its key concepts, including Software Security Initiative (SSI), descriptive model, and the
      four core domains (Governance, Intelligence, SSDL Touchpoints, Deployment).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  understand:
  - objective: Explain the differences between descriptive models like BSIMM and prescriptive models, and describe how BSIMM
      provides benchmarking for software security maturity.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  evaluate:
  - objective: Critique an organization's maturity based on BSIMM benchmarks, identifying gaps and recommending prioritization.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Assess a sample organization's SSI by mapping their practices to BSIMM activities and scoring maturity levels
      (0-3) for a given domain.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages of BSIMM's descriptive approach versus prescriptive models
    like NIST SSDF. Provide real-world examples from industries (e.g., finance vs. tech) and vote on whether organizations
    should start with BSIMM or a prescriptive framework. Justify using voter consensus on completeness and pedagogy.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
