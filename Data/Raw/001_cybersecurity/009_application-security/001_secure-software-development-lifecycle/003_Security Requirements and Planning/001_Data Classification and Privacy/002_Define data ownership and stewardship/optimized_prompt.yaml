active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the consequences of unclear data ownership in cybersecurity contexts (e.g.,
    Equifax breach). How might distinct roles for owners and stewards have mitigated risks? Link to SSDLC phases and data
    classification.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    truths (e.g., steward as ''strategic''); 3) Irrelevant concepts (e.g., mix with data classification levels); 4) Cybersecurity
    red herrings (e.g., Equifax as stewardship success). Ensure plausible for experts.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Application Security and
  Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC). Topic: ''Define data ownership and stewardship'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > 008_Application Security > Secure Software Development Lifecycle > 004_Security Requirements and Planning > Data Classification
  and Privacy > Define data ownership and stewardship). Consensus: 100% voter approval on pedagogy, completeness, examples.


  Incorporate:

  - Research: Data Owner (strategic accountability, business access; dqops.com); Data Steward (operational quality/compliance;
  elnion.com). Big picture: SSDLC secure data handling. Examples: Equifax breach (ownership failure), PII in app dev, GDPR.

  - Pedagogy: Bloom''s objectives [insert list above]; 4-layer scaffolding [insert scaffolding above]; Active learning ties
  (scenarios/discussions).
