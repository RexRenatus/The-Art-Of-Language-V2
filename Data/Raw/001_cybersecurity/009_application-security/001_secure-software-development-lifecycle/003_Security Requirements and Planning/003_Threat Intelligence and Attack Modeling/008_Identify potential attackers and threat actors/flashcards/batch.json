        "core_logic": "Adopting an adversarial perspective means simulating an attacker's mindset to uncover potential weaknesses and exploit paths. This proactive approach is fundamental to identifying risks that might be overlooked from a purely defensive viewpoint, thereby strengthening security.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The first distractor conflates threat modeling with compliance checks. The second makes an unrealistic claim of guaranteed discovery. The third suggests limiting the scope, which is counter to the adversarial mindset.",
        "analogy": "Thinking like an attacker is like a detective role-playing as the criminal to understand how and why a crime might have been committed, leading to better prevention strategies."
