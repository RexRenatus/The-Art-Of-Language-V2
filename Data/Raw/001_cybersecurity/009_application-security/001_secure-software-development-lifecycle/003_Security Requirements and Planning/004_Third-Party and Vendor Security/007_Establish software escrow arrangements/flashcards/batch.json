        "core_logic": "Mission-critical systems like ERPs represent a significant business dependency. Escrow mitigates the risk of vendor insolvency or abandonment, ensuring the business can maintain operations by accessing the source code.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors propose reasons related to vendor integration, IP protection for the vendor, or routine auditing, which are not the primary drivers for establishing escrow for a critical system.",
        "analogy": "For a hospital relying on a life-support machine, escrow is like having the manufacturer's schematics and a backup repair team on standby. If the manufacturer disappears, the hospital can still fix the machine to save lives."

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Without technical verification, the licensee risks receiving unusable materials upon a trigger event, negating the protective purpose of the escrow and leaving the business vulnerable to operational disruption.",
