  discussion_prompt: 'In light of recent supply chain attacks like Log4Shell and SolarWinds, debate whether organizations
    should prioritize open-source components for development speed or invest more in proprietary secure alternatives. What
    role does an SBOM play in mitigating these risks, and how does it align with CISA''s ''Securing the Software Supply Chain:
    Recommended Practices for Software Bill of Materials Consumption''?'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    – no, SCA analyzes risks); 2) Similar term confusion (e.g., SBOM vs. SPDX); 3) Partial truth (e.g., ''Only open-source
    needs SCA'' – applies to all third-party). Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter-noted misconceptions like SCA
    sufficiency alone.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 40-60 high-quality Anki flashcards
  on the topic ''Assess security of third-party software components'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security
  > Secure Software Development Lifecycle > 004_Security Requirements and Planning > Third-Party and Vendor Security > Assess
  security of third-party software components). Consensus: 100% voter approval on completeness, pedagogy, etc.


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full array from above]

  - Active Learning: Embed concepts from discussion (Log4Shell debate, open-source vs proprietary), peer teaching (SCA vs
  SBOM examples), problem-solving (GitHub repo with Syft/OWASP).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers + prior knowledge/big picture/sources [paste full scaffolding JSON].


  Use Flashcard Schema: [paste full schema]. Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''extra'':
  {''type'': ''mc'', ''options'': [{''text'': ''...'', ''correct'': true}, ...]}, ''tags'': [''bloom-remember'', ''layer1'',
  ''hierarchy-level6'']}, ...]. Ensure coverage: 20% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate/Create, 20% integration/active.
  Base content on provided research: third-party components, SCA, SBOM, C-SCRM, CISA docs (EO 14028, Log4Shell/SolarWinds).
  Make explanations educational, with just-in-time support.'
