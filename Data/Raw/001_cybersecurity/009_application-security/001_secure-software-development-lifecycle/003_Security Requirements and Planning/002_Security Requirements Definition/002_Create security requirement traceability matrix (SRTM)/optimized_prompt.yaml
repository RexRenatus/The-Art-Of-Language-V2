  discussion_prompt: 'Debate in groups: Is an SRTM sufficient on its own to ensure secure software development, or does it
    need to be integrated with other SDLC practices like threat modeling and code reviews? Provide real-world examples from
    breaches like Equifax or Log4j to support your position.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    SRTM with RTM). Ensure plausible from real-world misuse or incomplete knowledge.'
