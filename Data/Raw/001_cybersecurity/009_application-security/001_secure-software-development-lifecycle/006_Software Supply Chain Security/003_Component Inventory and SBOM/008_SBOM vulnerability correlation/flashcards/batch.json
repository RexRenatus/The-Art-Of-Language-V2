        "core_logic": "The 'Relationship' attribute in an SBOM defines how components connect (e.g., direct dependency, transitive dependency). This is vital for vulnerability impact analysis because it allows tracing how a vulnerability in one component can affect others in the software stack, because the dependency graph is mapped.",

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "A common SBOM standard, like those promoted by CISA and NTIA, aims to create a universal language for describing software components. This consistency is crucial because it enables automated processing and reliable correlation with vulnerability data, thereby enhancing transparency and security across the entire software supply chain.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors propose goals unrelated to SBOMs: dictating programming languages, creating vulnerability databases, or replacing licensing agreements, all of which are outside the scope of establishing a common SBOM standard.",
