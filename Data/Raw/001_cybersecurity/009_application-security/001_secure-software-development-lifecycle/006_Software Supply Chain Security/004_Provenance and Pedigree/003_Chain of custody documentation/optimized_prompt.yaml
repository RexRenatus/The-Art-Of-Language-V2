active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Chain of custody documentation is only relevant for physical
    evidence, not software supply chains.'' Use examples like the SolarWinds or Log4j vulnerabilities to support your arguments,
    addressing common misconceptions such as undocumented file copies being sufficient.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''only for physical assets''),
    2) Partial truth (e.g., lists some but misses timestamps), 3) Extreme/opposite (e.g., ''no documentation needed for internal
    transfers''). Base on voter-noted misconceptions and research (e.g., broken chain risks). Ensure distractors promote analysis.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom''s Taxonomy, active
  recall, and spaced repetition (Anki-compatible). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on ''Chain of Custody Documentation''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Secure Software Development Lifecycle > 015_Software Supply
  Chain Security > Provenance and Pedigree > Chain of Custody Documentation). Voter consensus (100% approval): Emphasize completeness
  (CISA critical infrastructure mitigation, Log4j/SolarWinds examples), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression, misconceptions), scaffolding
  (4 layers), concept map, big picture (AppSec/SDLC/supply chain attacks).


  Incorporate research: Chain of custody tracks asset lifecycle (handlers, timestamps, purposes) for integrity/accountability
  (NIST/CISA). Broken chain risks inadmissibility. Critical infra: CISA strategies - continuous logging, automation to mitigate
  tampering. Sources: csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/chain_of_custody, cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/cisa-insights_chain-of-custody-and-ci-systems_508.pdf.
