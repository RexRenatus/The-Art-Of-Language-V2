active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs between dependency mirroring, caching, and direct external fetching in terms
    of security, performance, and maintenance costs. Which would you recommend for a high-security enterprise environment
    (e.g., finance sector) and why? Consider real-world attacks like Log4Shell propagating through transitive dependencies.
  peer_teaching: 'Students pair up: Partner A explains dependency mirroring with a tool example (e.g., Verdaccio for npm,
    including setup steps and benefits), while Partner B explains caching (e.g., Maven local repo or Docker layer caching).
    Partners switch roles, then quiz each other on key differences and common pitfalls.'
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A Log4Shell-like vulnerability is discovered in a transitive dependency. In teams, design and
    pseudocode a mirroring/caching strategy to isolate, verify, and update dependencies. Include tools like Artifactory or
    pip cache, and integrate SLSA verification steps. Present and defend your solution.'

    secures dependencies'' vs. reality), (2) Partial truths (e.g., ''Mirroring only improves speed, not security''), (3) Confusions
    with related concepts (e.g., mix up mirroring with forking). Ensure distractors are realistic but incorrect, drawing from
    voter-noted pitfalls and research context.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom''s Taxonomy, active

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Active Learning: [insert full activities above] – reference in explanations.

  - Scaffolding: [insert full layers above] – balance flashcards across layers, use progression phrasing.

  - Big Picture: Key defense vs. supply chain attacks (SolarWinds, Log4j/Log4Shell); aligns with SLSA, OWASP SSC Cheat Sheet,
  NIST SSC, sigstore, zero-trust.

  - Prior Knowledge: Build on package managers (npm, Maven, pip) and issues like transitive deps.

  - Tools: Verdaccio (npm), Nexus/Artifactory (general), Maven local/pip/Docker caches.


  Strictly follow Flashcard Schema: [insert full schema above]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, valid and parseable.
  Ensure variety, accuracy, and pedagogical depth. No additional text.'
