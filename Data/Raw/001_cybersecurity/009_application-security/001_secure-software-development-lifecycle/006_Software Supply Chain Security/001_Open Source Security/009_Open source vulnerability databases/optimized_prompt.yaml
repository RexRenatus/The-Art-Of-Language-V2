active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, select a CVE (e.g., CVE-2021-44228 Log4Shell), query it in both NVD and OSV, then teach back to
    the group the key fields (e.g., description, severity via CVSS/EPSS, affected packages), highlighting differences.
  problem_solving: Given a sample Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for an application with OSS dependencies, use OSV.dev
    to identify vulnerabilities, prioritize using EPSS scores, and propose remediations (e.g., version pinning, patching via
    Dependabot), followed by a think-pair-share on common misconceptions like 'OSS vulnerabilities are rare'.

    - Distractor 1: Superficially similar but incorrect (e.g., confuse OSV with NVD ownership).

    - Distractor 2: Outdated/historical fact (e.g., pre-OSV schema formats).

    - Distractor 3: Related but off-topic (e.g., mix with closed-source DBs like VulnDB).

    Ensure distractors promote critical thinking (e.g., for ''Who maintains OSV?'': A) Google [correct], B) NIST, C) OpenSSF,
    D) Microsoft.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom''s Taxonomy, active
  recall, and spaced repetition (Anki/QT format). Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Open Source Vulnerability
  Databases'' in Cybersecurity (hierarchy: Level 1 Cybersecurity > Level 2 008_Application Security > Level 3 Secure Software
  Development Lifecycle > Level 4 015_Software Supply Chain Security > Level 5 Open Source Security > Level 6 Open source
