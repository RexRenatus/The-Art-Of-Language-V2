active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the role of OpenSSF Scorecard in mitigating real-world supply chain attacks
    like Log4j or SolarWinds. How does it address prerequisites like open source risks and SDLC phases? Support your views
    with Scorecard metrics.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol:
    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse 'Pinned Dependencies' with 'Dependency
      Updates').
    - 'Distractor 1: Superficially similar term (e.g., ''Branch Merging'' vs. ''Branch Protection'').'
    - 'Distractor 2: Opposite/extreme (e.g., ''No automation required'' for Scorecard checks).'
    - 'Distractor 3: Real but unrelated check (e.g., ''Fuzzing'' for a pinning question).'
    - Ensure distractors promote analysis by requiring understanding of interconnections (e.g., supply chain risks).
    quantity: 20-30 flashcards total, balanced across Bloom's levels (4-6 per level) and scaffolding layers (5-8 per layer).
