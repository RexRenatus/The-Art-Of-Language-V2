active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a case study discussion, analyze the SolarWinds supply chain attack using STRIDE categories. Identify
    which threats (e.g., Tampering, Elevation of Privilege) were exploited, explain how early STRIDE threat modeling could
    have mitigated them, and compare STRIDE's approach with the MITRE ATT&CK framework to spark debate on strengths and limitations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truth/similar threat (e.g., DoS for Tampering overload); 3) Opposite or unrelated (e.g., Confidentiality for
    Availability). Base on voter-noted confusions (Tampering vs. Disclosure) and research (e.g., IP spoofing distractor as
    Tampering). Ensure 75% difficulty balanced across layers.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in STRIDE threat modeling

  Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom''s objectives [insert learning_objectives array]; active learning [discussion: SolarWinds
  STRIDE analysis; peer teach categories w/examples; DFD e-commerce problem-solving]; 4 scaffolding layers [insert scaffolding_layers].


  Generate 60 high-quality flashcards (15 per layer, balanced Bloom''s: 20% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 30% APPLY/ANALYZE, 30% EVALUATE,
  20% CREATE). Cover definitions, DFD applications, mitigations, DREAD/CVSS prioritization, SDL integration.


  Use exact flashcard_schema: front (Q), back {answer, explanation, mitigation, distractors_explained}, metadata {bloom_level,
  layer, topic_hierarchy}.


  Distractors: 3 per MCQ per protocol. Explanations: concise, pedagogical links, real examples (SolarWinds, e-commerce DFD).
  Vary formats (def, mapping, MCQ, cloze, scenario). Output JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}, ''metadata'':
  {...}}, ...]. Ensure spaced repetition friendly: atomic facts, active recall.'
