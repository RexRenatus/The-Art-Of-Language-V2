active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, compare WS-Security with modern token-based standards like OAuth 2.0 and JWT.
    What are the trade-offs in terms of complexity, interoperability, and suitability for legacy SOA systems versus microservices?
    Provide real-world examples from industries like finance or healthcare.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    instead of SOAP headers), 1 related but incorrect concept (e.g., OAuth for authz only), 1 edge case (e.g., Kerberos without
    realm). Ensure correct answer is unambiguous. Base on research context and voter completeness (e.g., full WS-Security
    specs).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Service-Oriented Architecture
  (SOA) security (Domain: 008_Application Security > Secure Software Development Lifecycle > Secure 005_Architecture and Design
  > Architecture Patterns and Frameworks > SOA security). Use the provided topic hierarchy, research context (core concepts:
  CIA, auth/authz/non-repudiation; WS-Security: integrity/signatures, confidentiality/encryption, tokens - Username, X.509
  (PKI certs for sig/enc), Kerberos; WS-Trust/WS-SecureConversation), voter suggestions (complete standards, best practices,
  prior SOA knowledge), and this optimized learning prompt to generate high-quality flashcards.

  Content Completeness: Foundation - CIA/basic terms; Components - Full WS-Security (headers, tokens incl. Kerberos), WS-Trust
  (token issuance), WS-SecureConversation (derived keys); Implementation - Steps/code examples; Integration - Comparisons
  (OAuth/JWT), SDLC/big picture, concept map (SOA Security -> CIA -> WS-* -> Modern). Best practices: Enforce policies, mitigate
  XML attacks, federated identity.


  Generate 50 flashcards strictly following the schema. Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''cloze''|''mcq'', ''front'': ''...'',
  ''back'': ''...'', ''layer'': 1-4, ''blooms'': ''REMEMBER'', ''explanation'': ''...''}]. Ensure university pedagogy: Bloom''s
