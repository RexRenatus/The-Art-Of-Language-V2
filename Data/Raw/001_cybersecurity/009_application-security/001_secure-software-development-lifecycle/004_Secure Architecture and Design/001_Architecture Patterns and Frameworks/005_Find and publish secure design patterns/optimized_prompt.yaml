active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate whether openly publishing secure design patterns accelerates industry-wide security improvements
    or risks exploitation by attackers. Use OWASP examples (e.g., Cheat Sheet patterns) and SEI/CMU resources to support arguments,
    considering trade-offs like community knowledge sharing vs. attacker reconnaissance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs: Generate 3 plausible distractors per card:

    1. Common misconception (e.g., ''Secure patterns are just encryption libraries'' vs. architectural templates).

    2. Related but incorrect concept (e.g., ''GoF Singleton'' vs. ''Secure Singleton'').

    3. Extreme/outdated view (e.g., ''Publish without peer review'' vs. ''Include peer review''). Ensure distractors are realistic
    from research context/voter notes (e.g., OWASP vs. non-standards).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom''s Taxonomy, active
  learning, and scaffolding. Generate 50 high-quality flashcards for the topic **Find and publish secure design patterns**
  (Category: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Secure Software Development Lifecycle > Secure 005_Architecture and
  Design > Architecture Patterns and Frameworks > Level 6: Find and publish secure design patterns). Consensus: 82.9% approval.


  **Incorporate these exactly:**

  - **Learning Objectives:** [paste the array above].

  - **Scaffolding Layers:** [paste the scaffolding object above]. Distribute cards: 12 Layer 1, 13 Layer 2, 13 Layer 3, 12
  Layer 4.

  - **Active Learning:** Tie at least 20% of cards to activities [paste active_learning above].

  - **Research Context:** Secure Design Patterns: Reusable solutions to security design problems (SEI/CMU: sei.cmu.edu/library/secure-design-patterns,
  2009_005_001_15110.pdf). AppSec/SDLC integration (securitycompass.com). Standards: OWASP, NIST SP 800-218. Publish: Document/share
  via repos (GitHub/OWASP), versioning/peer review. Sources: SEI.cmu.edu, OWASP.org, NIST.gov.


  **Follow Flashcard Schema exactly:** [paste flashcard_schema above]. Ensure spaced repetition: concise fronts, detailed
  backs. Cover clarifications (publish = document/share reusable blueprints, not code). Prioritize active recall, misconceptions
  from voters (e.g., patterns ≠ code snippets). Output ONLY the 50 flashcards in markdown format, grouped by Bloom''s level.'
