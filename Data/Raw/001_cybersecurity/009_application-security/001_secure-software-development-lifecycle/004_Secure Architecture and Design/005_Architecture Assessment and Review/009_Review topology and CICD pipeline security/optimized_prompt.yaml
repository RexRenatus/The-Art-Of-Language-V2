active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In light of real-world attacks like SolarWinds or Codecov, debate which stage of the CI/CD pipeline (build,
    test, deploy) presents the greatest security risk and why, referencing OWASP Top 10 CI/CD risks and proposing prioritized
    mitigations. Support your position with evidence from NIST SP 800-204D.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (''Automation eliminates all risks''), 2. Ignoring topology (''Focus only on code, not infrastructure''), 3. Outdated
    practices (''Rely on perimeter security''), 4. Partial truths (''Scanning is enough without signing''). Ensure distractors
    are realistic from real-world breaches (e.g., Codecov bash uploader).'

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema provided. Cover all elements:

  - Learning objectives (span all 6 Bloom''s levels evenly).

  - Active learning (include prompts/scenarios in 20% of cards, e.g., ''Debate-style question'').

  - Scaffolding layers (10-15 cards per layer, tag with layer).

  - Core content: Definitions (Layer 1), components/topology (Layer 2), SPVS checklist (Layer 3: source integrity, secrets,
  scanning, signing, IaC, logging), integration/threat modeling (Layer 4). Include real-world: SolarWinds, Codecov; standards:
  OWASP Top 10 CI/CD, NIST SP 800-204D, SLSA; misconceptions.

  - Sources: OWASP CI/CD Security (owasp.org/www-project-ci-cd-security), NIST SP 800-218 (csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/218),
  SLSA Framework (slsa.dev).


  Best practices: Promote active recall (no hints on front), spaced repetition friendly (concise), university pedagogy (scaffolded
  complexity). Balance: 40% MCQ, 30% cloze, 20% scenario/apply, 10% diagram-describe. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcard
  objects matching the schema. No additional text.'
