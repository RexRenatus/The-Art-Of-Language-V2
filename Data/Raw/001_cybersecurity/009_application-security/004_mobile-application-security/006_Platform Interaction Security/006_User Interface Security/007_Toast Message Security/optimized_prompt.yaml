active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the usability-security trade-offs of using toast messages for authentication feedback (e.g., 'Login
    successful') in mobile apps. Argue when toasts are acceptable versus when persistent dialogs or in-app banners are safer,
    citing real-world phishing risks like Android toast overlays.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions:

    - Distractor 1: Semantic confusion (e.g., mix toast with notifications).

    - Distractor 2: Overgeneralization (e.g., attribute network risks to UI).

    - Distractor 3: Partial truth (e.g., related but incorrect platform like iOS for Android-specific).

    Ensure distractors test deep understanding (e.g., shoulder surfing vs. overlays).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate a deck of 25 high-quality flashcards
  on ''Toast Message Security'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Mobile 008_Application Security
  > 006_Platform Interaction Security > User Interface Security > Toast Message Security). Integrate university pedagogy:
  Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives, active learning, 4-layer scaffolding, voter consensus on risks (Android toast overlays/phishing,
  sensitive data leaks, shoulder surfing, OWASP M1).


  **Learning Objectives** (cover across cards): [paste the learning_objectives array here].

  **Active Learning** (reference in explanations): [paste active_learning object].

  **Scaffolding** (distribute cards: 30% L1, 25% L2, 25% L3, 20% L4): [paste scaffolding array].


  **Content Context**: Toast messages are ephemeral UI notifications vulnerable to overlays (Android SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW phishing),
  info leaks, injection. Examples: Malicious apps spoof system toasts for clickjacking. Secure: Avoid sensitive data, sanitize,
  use alternatives. OWASP Mobile Top 10 M1. Builds on UI basics.


  **Output Format**: Strictly follow flashcard_schema. Use JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'',
  ''tags'': [''...'']}, ...]. Ensure variety: 15 MCQ, 5 Q&A, 5 cloze. Distractors per protocol. Explanations comprehensive
  but concise (100-200 words max).'
