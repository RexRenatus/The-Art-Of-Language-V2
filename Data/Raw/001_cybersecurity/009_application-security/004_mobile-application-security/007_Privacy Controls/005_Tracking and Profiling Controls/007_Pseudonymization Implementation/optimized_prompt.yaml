active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare pseudonymization and anonymization in a mobile fitness app tracking user locations. When might
    one fail where the other succeeds? Discuss GDPR implications and real-world risks like re-identification attacks (e.g.,
    via linkage with external datasets).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions: 1. Confuse with anonymization
    (e.g., ''impossible to re-identify''); 2. Ignore mobile-specific risks (e.g., ''store keys with data''); 3. Overstate
    GDPR (e.g., ''pseudonymized data is not personal data''). Ensure distractors are realistic from voter-noted errors or
    research (e.g., re-identification via linkage).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Pseudonymization Implementation
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Mobile 008_Application Security > 007_Privacy Controls > Tracking
  and Profiling Controls > Pseudonymization Implementation). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities,
  4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema to create high-quality, pedagogically optimized flashcards.


  **Core Content to Cover (Voter Consensus: Complete Best Practices):** Definitions (pseudonymization, personal data, vs.
  anonymization); GDPR/UK GDPR (data minimization, by design/default); Techniques (hashing irreversible, tokenization reversible);
  Best Practices: 1. Data minimization (collect pseudonymized only); 2. Identify PII; 3. Select/implement techniques; 4. Securely
  separate/store re-identification keys (HSMs, mobile sandbox); 5. Key management (rotate, encrypt); 6. Risk assessments/audits
  for re-identification; 7. Mobile-specific: Tokenize UUIDs/locations in tracking; integrate with profiling controls. Sources:
  ico.org.uk (GDPR pseudonymization, accessed 2023); edpb.europa.eu (Guidelines 4/2019, accessed 2023); enisa.europa.eu (Privacy
  by Design, accessed 2023); cyberpilot.io (Anonymization comparison, accessed 2023).


  **Instructions:** Generate 25 flashcards (mix: 8 Basic Q/A, 10 MCQ, 7 Application Scenarios). Balance across Bloom''s levels
  (per objectives) and scaffolding layers. Ensure active learning integration (e.g., reference discussion/peer activities
  in explanations). Output in JSON: [{''type'': ''Basic|MCQ|Scenario'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...''}]. Follow schema
  exactly: Distractors plausible/misconception-based; Explanations detailed with sources/links/objectives/layers.'
