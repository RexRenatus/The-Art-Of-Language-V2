        "core_logic": "NIST SP 800-226 explains that privacy hazards arise when the practical implementation of differential privacy fails to correctly apply the mathematical framework. This can occur through incorrect parameter choices or flawed algorithms, leading to a weaker privacy guarantee than intended, thus enabling information leakage.",

        "analogy": "A privacy hazard in DP implementation is like a chef misreading a recipe's instructions for adding a precise amount of salt; the dish might still be edible, but it won't have the intended flavor balance (privacy guarantee)."
