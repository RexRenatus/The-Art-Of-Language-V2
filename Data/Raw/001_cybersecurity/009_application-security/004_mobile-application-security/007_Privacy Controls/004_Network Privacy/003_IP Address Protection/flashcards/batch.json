IPv6's large space allows unique global addresses, simplifying end-to-end security but requiring robust host-based security as devices are more directly addressable.",

        "analogy": "IPv4 with NAT is like a single public mailbox for an entire apartment building; it hides individual apartments but makes mail delivery complex. IPv6 is like each apartment having its own mailbox, simplifying delivery but requiring each apartment to secure its own box."
