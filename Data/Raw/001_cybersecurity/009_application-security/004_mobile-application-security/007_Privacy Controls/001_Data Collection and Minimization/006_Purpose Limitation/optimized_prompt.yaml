active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of mobile apps, debate the tension between purpose limitation and business innovation.
    Using examples like Cambridge Analytica's data misuse or TikTok's data practices, argue whether strict purpose limitation
    stifles user personalization or better protects privacy. Consider ethical implications and propose balanced solutions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''allows repurposing if
    anonymized''—wrong, as compatibility test required). 2) Related but distinct concept (e.g., mix with data minimization).
    3) Extreme/overly broad (e.g., ''no data collection allowed''). Base on voter-noted pitfalls like viewing it as a ''legal
    checkbox'' vs. security principle.'

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards optimized for university-level pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (remember/understand: 30%,
  apply/analyze: 40%, evaluate/create: 30%), active learning (link cards to discussion on purpose limitation vs. innovation
  e.g., Cambridge Analytica/TikTok; peer teaching on mobile implementation; health app problem-solving), and 4 scaffolding
  layers (Layer 1: Foundation—definitions/data min/transparency; Layer 2: Components—GDPR Art 5(1)(b) full text/relationships;
  Layer 3: Implementation—mobile steps/audits; Layer 4: Integration—NIST CSF/dynamic consent).


  Incorporate research: Purpose limitation prevents incompatible processing; GDPR Art 5(1)(b): ''personal data shall be collected
  for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible...''; NIST CSF
