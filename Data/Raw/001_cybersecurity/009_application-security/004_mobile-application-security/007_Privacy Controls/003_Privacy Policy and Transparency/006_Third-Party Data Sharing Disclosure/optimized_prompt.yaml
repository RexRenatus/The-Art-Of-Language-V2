  Core Concepts: Third-party relationship (external data processors), data sharing, disclosure (transparency on practices/risks),
  risk management. Standards: FDIC/Federal Reserve/OCC June 2023 Guidance (third-party lifecycle risk mgmt: plan, due diligence,
  contract, oversight, contingency; tailored to complexity); NIST SP 800-53 Rev 3/5 (SA family: SA-4 external services acquisition/security;
  SA-9 external config mgmt; emphasizes disclosure in acquired systems). Mobile: Google Play Data Safety, App Store Privacy
  Labels for SDKs. Sources: FDIC.gov interagency guidance, NIST.gov SP 800-53, developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#data-collection-and-storage,
  play.google.com/about/data-safety.

  Generate 50 flashcards per the exact schema: Front (Question/MC), Back (Answer + Explanation + Distractors rationale if
  MC + Metadata). Ensure measurable verbs, prior links (privacy basics), completeness (full NIST/FDIC desc, examples/templates),
  interconnections (concept map style). Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'',
  ''explanation'': ''...'', ''metadata'': {...}}}]. Vary difficulty, no repetition, high educational value.'
