active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent does the Google Play Data Safety section truly enhance user privacy? Debate using real
    app examples like Facebook or TikTok, considering discrepancies between declared practices and actual behaviors.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains 'data collection' vs. 'data sharing' using app scenarios (e.g., a fitness
    app tracking location), while the other peer teaches back with a different example; switch roles and discuss edge cases
    like third-party SDKs.
  problem_solving: Analyze a real app's Data Safety form (e.g., from Google Play) against its Android manifest/permissions;
    identify discrepancies, propose fixes, and role-play a developer-user negotiation on data practices for a hypothetical
    fitness app using think-pair-share.

    collection with sharing); 2. Edge cases (e.g., optional vs. required); 3. Real-world pitfalls (e.g., SDK third-party sharing
    not disclosed); 4. Partial truths (e.g., GDPR alignment but missing consent). Ensure distractors teach by contrast.'
