  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges of asset identification in obfuscated or packed mobile apps
    (e.g., using ProGuard). How does incomplete asset analysis impact reverse engineering outcomes? Support arguments with
    real-world examples from mobile security breaches.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate high-quality MCQ flashcards optimized for university pedagogy:

  - **Content Focus**: Strictly mobile app RE asset analysis (e.g., APK components, secrets, libs via Jadx/Frida/APKTool).
  Avoid general OT/IT; adapt taxonomies to mobile context.

  - **Learning Objectives**: Cover these Bloom''s levels exactly as provided: [INSERT LEARNING_OBJECTIVES_ARRAY_HERE].

  - **Scaffolding**: Base content on 4 layers: [INSERT SCAFFOLDING_JSON_HERE].

  - **Active Learning Ties**: Weave in hints referencing discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving.

  - **Big Picture**: Emphasize how asset analysis enables targeted RE and vuln prioritization.


  **Output 50-100 flashcards in JSON array**: Each as {"front": "Question + A/B/C/D options", "back": {"correct": "e.g., A",
  "explanation": "...", "hints": ["..."], "layer": "1-4", "bloom": "REMEMBER", "source": "Hierarchy/Research"}}.


  **Schema & Distractors**: Follow exact [INSERT FLASHCARD_SCHEMA_JSON_HERE]. Ensure distractors are plausible (e.g., OT hardware
  confusion). Vary difficulty; prioritize APPLY/ANALYZE.


  Generate now, ensuring accuracy, engagement, and alignment.'
