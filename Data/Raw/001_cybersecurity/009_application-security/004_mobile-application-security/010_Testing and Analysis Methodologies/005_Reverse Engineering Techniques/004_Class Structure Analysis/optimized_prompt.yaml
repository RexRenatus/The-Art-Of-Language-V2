active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between usability and security in class design (e.g., public
    vs. private fields). Using a real-world example like a banking app, argue how exposing a public mutable field could lead
    to tampering and propose mitigations, referencing OOP principles and NICE Framework T0206.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    with ''public''), (2) Partial truths (e.g., valid for non-mobile but wrong for Android), (3) Related but irrelevant concepts
    (e.g., network sec instead of class access), (4) Tool misuse (e.g., APKTool for decomp vs. Jadx). Ensure distractors teach
    by contrast.'
