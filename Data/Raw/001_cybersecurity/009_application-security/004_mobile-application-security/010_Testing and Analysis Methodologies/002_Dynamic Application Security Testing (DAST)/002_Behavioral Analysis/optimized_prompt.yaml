active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the ethical implications of behavioral analysis in mobile applications during DAST—balance user
    privacy (e.g., monitoring UI interactions and geolocations) versus security benefits (e.g., detecting compromised credentials).
    Reference real-world cases like insider threats in mobile banking apps or data breaches from anomalous API calls.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate:

  - Research: UEBA for anomaly detection in user/entity behaviors (baselines, ML/stats); threats like insider/compromised
  credentials; mobile DAST focus (runtime API calls, UI, permissions, geolocations); NIST SP 800-63 for identity behaviors.

  - Voter priorities: Mobile-specific (anomalous runtime behaviors); complete NIST/sources; ethical debates.
