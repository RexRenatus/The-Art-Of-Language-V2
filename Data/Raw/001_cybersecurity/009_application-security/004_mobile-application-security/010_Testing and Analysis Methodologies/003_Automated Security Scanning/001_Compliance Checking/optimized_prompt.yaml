active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the prioritization of legally binding regulations (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA)
    versus voluntary standards (e.g., OWASP MASVS, NIST CSF) when implementing compliance checking for mobile apps. Provide
    evidence from real-world breaches and propose a hybrid prioritization framework.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  the topic hierarchy: Level 1: Cybersecurity | Level 2: 008_Application Security | Level 3: Mobile 008_Application Security

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Embed prompts in explanations where relevant (e.g., ''Discuss in groups: ...'').

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers: [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM ABOVE].


  Generate flashcards using this EXACT schema: Output a JSON array of 25 flashcards, each as an object with fields: {front,
  correct_answer, distractor1 (with why wrong), distractor2 (with why wrong), distractor3 (with why wrong), explanation, bloom_level,
  scaffolding_layer}.


  Best practices: Questions test progression from recall to creation. Distractors: 3 per card, plausible (e.g., based on common
  confusions like NIST vs. ISO). Ground in research: NIST CSF 2.0 functions, OWASP MASVS, CIS, PCI-DSS, ISO 27001; sources
  like NIST.gov, OWASP.org. Ensure university-level rigor with Bloom''s, active learning ties, and mobile AppSec focus.'
