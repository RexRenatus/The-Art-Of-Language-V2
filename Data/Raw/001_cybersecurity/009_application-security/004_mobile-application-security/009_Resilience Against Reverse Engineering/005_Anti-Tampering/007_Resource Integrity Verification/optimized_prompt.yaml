active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the effectiveness of cryptographic checksums vs. digital signatures for verifying mobile app
    resource integrity in scenarios like sideloading vs. app store distribution. Debate pros/cons, referencing real-world
    failures like XcodeGhost or repackaged APKs, and propose hybrid approaches.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use discussion/peer/problem-solving scenarios in cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers: [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM ABOVE].


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following this schema: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD_SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Output ONLY valid
  JSON array of objects, each with ''front'', ''back'' (nested answer/explanation/distractors), and ''metadata''. Ensure active
  recall, spaced repetition optimization (precise terms, scenarios), and distractors per protocol. Build on crypto priors
  (hashing/signatures).'
