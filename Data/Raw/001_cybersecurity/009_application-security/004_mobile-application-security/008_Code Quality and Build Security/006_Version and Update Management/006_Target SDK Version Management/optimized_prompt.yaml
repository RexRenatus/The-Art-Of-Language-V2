active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of balancing minSdkVersion for broad device coverage (e.g.,
    95%+ market share) against updating targetSdkVersion for security. Cite real-world examples like Google Play delistings
    and propose a strategy for a hypothetical banking app.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - 'Distractor 2: Outdated info (e.g., old API requirement like API 30).'
  - 'Distractor 3: Confused terms (e.g., mix up with compileSdkVersion or minSdkVersion).'
  - Ensure distractors are plausible, derived from real developer errors or partial knowledge.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Create high-quality Anki-style flashcards
  on ''Target SDK Version Management'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Mobile 008_Application
  Security > 008_Code Quality and Build Security > Version and Update Management > Target SDK Version Management).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [REMEMBER: Define... ] (use to tag flashcards).

  - Scaffolding: Generate flashcards per layer (Layer 1 Foundation: definitions; Layer 2 Components: relationships/Google
  reqs; Layer 3 Implementation: update steps; Layer 4 Integration: best practices/risks/examples).

  - Active Learning: Draw from scenarios for realistic questions.

  - Research Context: targetSdkVersion (design API), minSdkVersion (lowest), compileSdkVersion (build); Google Play: target
  API 34+ (Aug 2024); risks: compatibility mode, deprecated APIs, delistings; best practices: 95%+ coverage, handle changes,
  test.


  Output 50 flashcards in JSON array: [{''front'': ''Question?'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''Correct'', ''explanation'': ''Details...'',
  ''references'': ''Layer 2''}, ''options'': [''A'', ''B (correct)'', ''C'', ''D''], ''metadata'': {''bloom_level'': ''APPLY'',
  ''layer'': 3, ''difficulty'': ''Medium''}}].


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: MCQ with 4 options (1 correct), distractors (misconceptions/outdated/confusions), full
  explanations with security focus. Balance: 20% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 30% APPLY/ANALYZE, 30% EVALUATE, 20% CREATE. 12-13 per
