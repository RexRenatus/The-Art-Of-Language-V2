active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between rapid beta releases for user feedback and comprehensive security testing
    in mobile app development—when does speed compromise safety, and how can frameworks like OWASP and NIST CSF balance this?
    Provide real-world examples from Android Beta or iOS TestFlight incidents.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains OWASP WSTG testing categories relevant to beta phases (e.g., information gathering,
    configuration testing), while the partner teaches NIST CSF integration for beta security (e.g., Protect function for access
    controls). Switch roles and quiz each other on mobile-specific applications.
  problem_solving: Given a real-world scenario of a mobile app beta release with version rollback vulnerabilities (e.g., exposed
    OTA updates leading to downgrade attacks), groups perform threat modeling, design a mitigation plan including secure distribution,
    tester vetting, and feedback encryption, then present and critique peer plans.

  distractor_protocol: Distractors must be plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse OWASP ASVS with WSTG; mix
    NIST CSF functions like Protect with Respond; overlook mobile specifics like TestFlight for Android scenarios). Ensure
    1-2 are 'half-right' (e.g., valid for production but not beta), 1 overly simplistic, 1 irrelevant/off-topic.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom''s Taxonomy, active
  recall, and spaced repetition. Generate 40-50 high-quality MCQ flashcards on ''Beta Testing Security'' (Topic Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Mobile 008_Application Security > 008_Code Quality and Build Security > Version
  and Update Management > Beta Testing Security). Cover mobile app contexts like Android Beta/OTA updates, iOS TestFlight
  risks, securing distribution, tester access, feedback handling, threat modeling, pen-testing.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full list here]

  - Active Learning: Tie explanations to discussion (trade-offs), peer teaching (OWASP/NIST), problem-solving (scenarios).

  - Scaffolding: Balance flashcards: 25% Layer 1 (foundations), 25% Layer 2 (frameworks: OWASP ASVS/WSTG, NIST CSF full functions),
  25% Layer 3 (procedures), 25% Layer 4 (SDLC integration). Build on prior topics (SDLC, code quality).

  - Research: OWASP ASVS (verification standards), WSTG (testing guide), NIST CSF (Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover),
  mobile specifics.


  Use exact Flashcard Schema: JSON array of objects with ''front'', ''back'' (correct_answer, explanation, bloom_level, layer,
  distractors). Distractors plausible per protocol. Explanations detailed, pedagogical, with sources (e.g., OWASP.org, NIST.gov).
  Ensure progressive difficulty, active learning prompts in explanations for review. Output ONLY the JSON array.'
