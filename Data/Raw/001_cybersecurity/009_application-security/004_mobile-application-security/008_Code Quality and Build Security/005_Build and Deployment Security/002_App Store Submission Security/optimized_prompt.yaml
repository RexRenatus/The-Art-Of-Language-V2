    with entitlements), 2) Partial truth (e.g., correct process but wrong order), 3) Extreme/edge case (e.g., outdated guideline).
    Ensure distractors are realistic based on research/voter suggestions, avoiding obvious errors. Balance card types: 40%

  Bloom''s objectives, 4-layer scaffolding, prior knowledge links, completeness (Apple Platform Security, Google Play equivalents,
  sources), best practices, big picture (secure deployment vs. supply chain attacks).


  Incorporate this content:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the 6 objectives above]

  - Active Learning: [reference activities for explanations]

  - Scaffolding: [paste the 4 layers]


  Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards using EXACTLY the schema: {''front'':..., ''back'':..., ''type'':..., ''explanation'':...,
  ''distractors'':[...], ''bloom_level'':..., ''scaffolding_layer'':..., ''tags'':[...]}. Follow distractor protocol and explanation
  requirements strictly.


  Ensure coverage: All Bloom''s levels (balanced), all layers (10 cards/layer), Apple/Google comparisons, best practices (e.g.,
  ''Declare third-party data accurately''), sources cited. Cards promote active recall, spaced repetition. Output as JSON
  array of objects. No extra text.'
