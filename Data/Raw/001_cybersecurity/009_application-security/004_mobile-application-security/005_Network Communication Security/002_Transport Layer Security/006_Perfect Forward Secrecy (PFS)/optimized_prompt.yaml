active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, compare the security implications of using RSA key exchange versus ECDHE for PFS
    in a scenario where an attacker compromises the server's long-term private key years after sessions occurred. What real-world
    risks (e.g., in mobile apps) does this highlight, and how does TLS 1.3 mitigate them?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate this research context: PFS ensures session keys are ephemeral (via DHE/ECDHE), protecting past/future sessions
  from long-term key compromise in TLS/SSL. TLS 1.3 (RFC 8446) mandates PFS with ECDHE. Standards: NIST SP 800-52, OWASP,
  PCI DSS. Real-world: Chrome enforces PFS. Sources: RFC 8446 (TLS 1.3), RFC 5246 (TLS 1.2), Cloudflare/OWASP guides.


  Prior Knowledge: Build on TLS handshakes/Diffie-Hellman.


  Use these EXACT elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Active Learning: Embed hints/references in 20% of cards (e.g., ''Relate to discussion: RSA vs ECDHE'').

  - Scaffolding: Generate 10-12 cards per layer [insert full scaffolding above].

  - Concept Map: Reference in Layer 2 cards (e.g., ''PFS branches to Ephemeral Keys → TLS Handshake'').


  Follow Flashcard Schema EXACTLY [insert full schema above]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects, grouped by scaffolding
  layer. Ensure university pedagogy: Bloom''s progression, active recall via MCQs, distractors for critical thinking. Cover
  mobile app security implications. Voter consensus: 100% approval on pedagogy/completeness.'
