        "core_logic": "Certificate validation relies on a chain of trust leading to a root CA trusted by the client's software. If the root CA that signed the certificate (or an intermediate CA in the chain) is not in the browser's trust store, the chain cannot be established, triggering a warning.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors suggest outdated protocols, clock skew, or IP changes as the primary cause, whereas the most common reason for an untrusted certificate warning is the absence of the issuing CA in the trust store.",
        "analogy": "It's like trying to verify someone's ID, but the issuing authority (the CA) isn't recognized by the verifier (the browser); the ID is therefore considered invalid."
