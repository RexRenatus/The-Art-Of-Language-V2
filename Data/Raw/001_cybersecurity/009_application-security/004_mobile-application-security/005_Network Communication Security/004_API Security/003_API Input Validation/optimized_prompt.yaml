active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the risks of relying solely on client-side input validation for APIs. Use
    examples from OWASP API Top 10 (e.g., injection risks) and propose how server-side semantic validation addresses untrusted
    mobile app data flows. Reference prior knowledge from 006_API Security on untrusted data flows.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate a set of 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Spaced Repetition using university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy
  (prioritize APPLY+), active learning hooks, 4-layer scaffolding (Foundation: basics/prereqs; Components: syntactic/semantic;
  Implementation: code/tools; Integration: OWASP/NIST/mobile).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full list above]

  - Scaffolding: [paste full layers]

  - Active Learning: Tie cards to activities (e.g., ''Discuss in peer teaching'')

  - Research: Syntactic (format), Semantic (logic), untrusted sources, prevents SQLi/XSS/DoS; OWASP API Top 10 (e.g., API1:2023
  Broken Validation), NCSC, NIST SP 800-95 (comprehensive server-side).

  - Voter Priorities: Examples/code, measurable outcomes (quizzes/critiques), concept map (central: Validation > branches),
  sources (OWASP.org/projects/api-security, ncsc.gov.uk).


  Use EXACT Flashcard Schema: [paste full schema]. Output ONLY the JSON array of flashcards. Ensure progressive complexity,
  100% coverage, engaging (e.g., ''Spot the vuln!''). No extra text.'
