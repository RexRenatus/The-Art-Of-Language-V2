active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between relying on VPNs for MITM protection on public WiFi
    versus implementing app-level measures like certificate pinning and HSTS. Consider usability, performance, and coverage
    for sensitive mobile app data. Support arguments with real-world examples like Heartbleed or public hotspot attacks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
