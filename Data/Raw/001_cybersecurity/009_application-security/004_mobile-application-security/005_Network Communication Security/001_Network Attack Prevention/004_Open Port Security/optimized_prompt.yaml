active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a corporate network, debate whether closing all non-essential ports (e.g., beyond 80/443) is always
    the best practice or if there are scenarios where controlled open ports enhance functionality without compromising security.
    Use real-world examples like RDP (3389) in remote work setups and reference NIST CSF guidelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
