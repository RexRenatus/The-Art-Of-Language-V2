active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using certificate pinning versus full chain validation
    in mobile apps. How does this relate to preventing MITM attacks in the context of OWASP Mobile Top 10 (M2)? Provide real-world
    examples from breaches like those involving compromised CAs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    1 from related but incorrect concepts (e.g., mixing with TLS handshake), 1 edge case reversal (e.g., valid vs. revoked).
    Ensure distractors are realistic from real-world pitfalls or deprecated practices.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in X.509 Certificate Handling
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Mobile 008_Application Security > 001_Cryptography > 006_Digital
  Signatures and Certificates > X.509 Certificate Handling). Use the provided learning objectives (Bloom''s Taxonomy progression),
  active learning ideas for depth, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema to create optimized, spaced-repetition-friendly
  flashcards.


  Context: X.509 certificates (RFC 5280) bind public keys to identities via PKI/CAs. Critical for mobile app security against
  MITM (OWASP M2). Cover: structure (fields/extensions), validation (path algorithm, CRL/OCSP), best practices (pinning, rotation,
  TLS integration, avoid SHA1/self-signed pitfalls).


  Prerequisites: Public-key crypto, digital signatures.


  Generate 40-50 flashcards in JSON array format: [{''type'': ''basic|mcq'', ''front'': {...}, ''back'': {...}, ''tags'':
  [''layer:1'', ''bloom:REMEMBER'', ''hierarchy:006_X.509'']}]. Follow schema exactly: distractors plausible/common errors;
  explanations cite RFC 5280/web sources; balance layers/Bloom''s. Ensure active recall: questions test application/analysis.
  Output ONLY the JSON array.'
