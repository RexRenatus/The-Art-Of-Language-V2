active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, explore how violations of key usage restrictions contributed to breaches like
    the Uber API key leak (2022, where keys were used beyond intended scopes) and LastPass incidents (2022, improper key handling).
    Propose preventive measures using NIST SP 800-57 and debate trade-offs for mobile apps.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - D1: Common misconception (e.g., ''Signing keys can decrypt'' – confuses asymmetric roles).

    - D2: Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''All keys can encrypt/decrypt'' – ignores restrictions).

    - D3: Related but incorrect standard/example (e.g., ''Per PCI-DSS only'' instead of NIST 800-57).

    Ensure distractors are realistic, derived from voter priorities/web research (e.g., breaches, truncated NIST).'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Application Security (Mobile)\
  \ and Cryptography. Generate 25-35 high-quality flashcards on 'Key Usage Restrictions' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity >\
  \ 008_Application Security > Mobile 008_Application Security > 001_Cryptography > Cryptographic Key Lifecycle > Key Usage\
  \ Restrictions). \n\nIncorporate university pedagogy: Bloom's Taxonomy objectives [insert learning_objectives array here\
  \ verbatim]. Active learning: Tie explanations to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving where relevant. Scaffolding:\
  \ Distribute evenly across 4 layers [insert scaffolding_layers object here verbatim]. Ensure completeness: NIST SP 800-57\
  \ (key states/operations), NIST CSF 2.0 (PR.DS/PR.AC/GV), examples (Uber leak, LastPass, iOS Secure Enclave), sources.\n\
  \nUse exact flashcard schema [insert flashcard_schema object here verbatim]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects,\
  \ valid and parseable. Cover all objectives/layers; vary difficulty; make questions active/recall-focused for spaced repetition."
