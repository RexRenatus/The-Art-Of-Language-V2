        "core_logic": "ECC's efficiency (smaller keys, faster operations) makes it easier to implement and deploy, which supports cryptographic agility. Systems using ECC can more readily adopt new ECC standards or transition to other cryptographic primitives because the performance overhead is lower. This allows for quicker updates and adaptation to evolving security landscapes, as recommended by NIST CSWP 39.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly link agility to ECC's complexity, the permanence of its standardization, or its nature as a single configurable algorithm, missing the core benefit of its efficiency enabling easier transitions.",
        "analogy": "ECC's efficiency is like having a lightweight, adaptable vehicle that can quickly switch between different terrains (security needs) compared to a heavy, slow vehicle that's hard to modify."
