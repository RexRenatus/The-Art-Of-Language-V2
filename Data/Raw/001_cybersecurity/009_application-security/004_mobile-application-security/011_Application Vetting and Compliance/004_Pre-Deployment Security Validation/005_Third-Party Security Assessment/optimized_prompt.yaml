active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In light of recent supply chain attacks like SolarWinds or MOVEit, debate whether organizations should
    prioritize third-party security assessments over their own internal security hardening. Provide evidence from frameworks
    like NIST CSF.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: Create 3 plausible distractors for MCQs based on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Vendor SOC 2 certification
    eliminates all risks' as distractor vs. 'It reduces but does not eliminate risks'). Draw from real-world errors like over-relying
    on ratings, ignoring supply chain attacks, or neglecting mobile-specific regs. Ensure distractors are 70% correct-sounding
    but factually wrong, referencing frameworks/sources.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, particularly for university-level
  pedagogy using Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, and scaffolding. Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for
  the topic ''Third-Party Security Assessment'' in the hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Mobile 008_Application
  Security > 011_Application Vetting and Compliance > Pre-Deployment Security Validation > Third-Party Security Assessment.
  Voter consensus: 82.9% approval (7 voters) emphasizes pedagogy, completeness, and mobile integrations.


  Incorporate this research context: Third-party security assessment evaluates vendor risks via TPRM, including questionnaires,
  audits, Bitsight ratings. Key frameworks: NIST CSF 2.0 (taxonomy for risk management), ISO 27001, NIST SP 800-53 (checklists),
  regulations (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, SOC 2). Mobile focus: Vetting SDKs/libraries (OWASP Mobile Top 10), app store compliance,
  examples like Google AdMob. Risks from supply chain attacks (SolarWinds, MOVEit). Sources: bitsight.com, nist.gov (CSF 2.0,
  SP 800-53), owasp.org (Mobile Top 10), iso.org (27001).
