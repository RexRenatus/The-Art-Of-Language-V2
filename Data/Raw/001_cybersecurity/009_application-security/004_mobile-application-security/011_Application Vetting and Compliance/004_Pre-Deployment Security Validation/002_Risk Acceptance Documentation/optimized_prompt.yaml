    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQ: 1. Common misconception (e.g., ''acceptance = no documentation''), 2. Related
      but incorrect term (e.g., ''risk transfer'' vs. acceptance), 3. Extreme/overstated option (e.g., ''always mitigate high-impact'').'
    - 'Ensure distractors teach: Explain why wrong in back.'
    - 'Balance difficulty: 1 easy, 1 medium, 1 tricky.'
    - Avoid 'all/none' traps.
