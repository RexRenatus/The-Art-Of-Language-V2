        "core_logic": "MASVS-CODE requires developers to use software components without known vulnerabilities because outdated or insecure libraries are a major attack vector, and managing these dependencies is a core aspect of secure software development.",

        "analogy": "MASVS-CODE's requirement for secure components is like a builder ensuring all the pre-fabricated parts used in construction are certified safe and up-to-code, not just that the final structure is sound (MASVS-RESILIENCE)."
