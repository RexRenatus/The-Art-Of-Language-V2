  discussion_prompt: In a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) environment, debate which ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A controls (e.g., A.6.2.1
    Mobile device policy, A.8.1 User endpoint devices) are most challenging to enforce and why. Propose 2-3 optimizations
    drawing from NIST SP 800-124r2, supporting arguments with real-world examples like enterprise MDM failures.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    confuse A.8.26 with A.8.25; outdated 2013 control numbers; NIST equivalents; irrelevant controls like physical security).
    Ensure one is a ''close but wrong'' variant (e.g., similar control ID).'
