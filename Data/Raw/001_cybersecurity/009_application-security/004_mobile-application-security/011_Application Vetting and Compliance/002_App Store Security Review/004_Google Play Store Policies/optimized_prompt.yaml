  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the effectiveness of Google Play Store policies in balancing developer
    innovation with user safety. Use real-world examples of rejected apps (e.g., crypto scams or misleading health apps) and
    propose one policy improvement, citing specific policy excerpts.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    gaps like incomplete Health section.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university-style pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Google Play Store
  Policies'' (Category: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Mobile 008_Application Security > 011_Application Vetting
  and Compliance > App Store Security Review > Google Play Store Policies).


  **Full Research Context (Completed for Completeness):** Google Play policies ensure a safe ecosystem via Developer Program
  Policies (core rules), Developer Distribution Agreement, and Play Console. Key Areas: 1) Restricted Content (graphic violence,
  sex/nudity, drugs/substances, hate speech, gambling, real-money gaming; Health Content/Services: prohibits unproven treatments,
  misleading diagnostics/therapies, false medical claims); 2) Malware (viruses, trojans, spyware); 3) Impersonation/Fraud
  (fake identities, scams); 4) Device/Network Abuse (rooting/jailbreak detection, excessive battery/data use, unauthorized
  SMS/calls); 5) Advertising (no disruptive/deceptive ads, proper disclosure); 6) Permissions/Data Safety (justify uses, no
  hidden tracking); 7) Monetization (compliant IAP/subscriptions); 8) IP (no infringement). Review process: automated scans
  + manual. Sources: https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/, https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/113476,

  **Prerequisites:** Assume prior knowledge of mobile threats (malware), app lifecycle, cybersec basics.


  **Incorporate Exactly:**

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the array above].

  - Scaffolding: [paste the 4 layers above]; tag each card with layer.

  - Active Learning: [paste activities above]; include 5-10 cards as ''prompt cards'' linking to these (e.g., ''Apply problem-solving:
  Analyze this scenario...'').


  **Generation Rules:**

  - Cover all policy areas fully, especially Health Content, Malware, Ads, Permissions.

  - Bloom''s progression: 20% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate, 20% Create.

  - Use Flashcard Schema exactly: JSON array of objects with ''front'', ''back'' (answer, explanation, type, distractors if
  MCQ), ''bloom_level'', ''layer'', ''objective_linked''.

  - Distractors: Follow protocol strictly.

  - Explanations: 2-4 sentences, educational, with policy quotes/examples.

  - Varied: Include comparisons (e.g., vs. Apple), scenarios, checklists.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 50 flashcards, no extra text.'
