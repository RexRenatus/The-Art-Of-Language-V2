  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the following: ''Do privacy labels like those in Apple/Google App Stores
    truly empower consumers, or do they create a false sense of security due to accuracy issues? Use NIST CSWP 23 criteria
    and real-world examples (e.g., apps fined for mislabeling) to support your position.'' Encourage critical thinking by
    requiring evidence from research context.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Based on real-world confusions (e.g., outdated EO references); 3) Plausible from partial knowledge (e.g., app store
    examples misattributed); 4) Avoid obvious errors. Ensure 20% basic recall cards, 30% MCQ apply/analyze, 30% scenario eval/create,
    20% open-ended.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate high-quality, Anki-optimized flashcards
  on ''Privacy Label Accuracy'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Mobile 008_Application Security
  > 011_Application Vetting and Compliance > App Store Security Review > Privacy Label Accuracy). Use the provided learning
  objectives, active learning activities, and 4-layer scaffolding as the core content source. Ensure completeness: Include
  full SDLC best practices (threat modeling, secure coding, full Security Reviews/Audits with behavioral verification), NIST
  details (CSWP 23, Privacy Framework, EO 14028), app store examples (Apple/Google), prior knowledge links (SDLC/threat modeling),
  and big picture (trust/risk reduction).


  Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE].

  Active Learning: Embed prompts as scenario-based cards (e.g., ''Discuss: [prompt]'').

  Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL LAYERS FROM ABOVE] – Base all cards on these.


  Follow this exact Flashcard Schema: [INSERT FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as {"front":
