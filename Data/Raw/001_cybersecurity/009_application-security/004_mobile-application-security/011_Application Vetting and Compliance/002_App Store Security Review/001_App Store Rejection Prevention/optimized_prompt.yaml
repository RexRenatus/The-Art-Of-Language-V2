active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare Apple App Store and Google Play guidelines on privacy (referencing MASVS-PRIVACY controls). Which
    platform is more developer-friendly for implementing cybersecurity measures, and why? Debate pros (e.g., flexibility)
    and cons (e.g., stringency) with evidence from real rejection examples.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, select a MASVS control group (e.g., MASVS-NETWORK or MASVS-PLATFORM). One partner explains its
    role in preventing app store rejections with guideline mappings; the other teaches it back using a concrete app example
    (e.g., insecure API calls). Switch roles and discuss integration challenges.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: Your fitness app stores health data insecurely using plain text SharedPreferences and transmits
    it over HTTP. Diagnose rejection risks using OWASP MASVS (e.g., MASVS-STORAGE, MASVS-NETWORK) and Apple/Google guidelines.
    Propose fixes, prioritize them, and simulate a compliance review in groups.'

    code security''); 2. Similar but incorrect MASVS control (e.g., MASVS-STORAGE vs. MASVS-NETWORK); 3. Outdated/misremembered
    guideline (e.g., pre-2023 privacy rules). Ensure distractors are realistic based on frequent rejections (privacy, crashes)
    and voter-noted gaps.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards on ''App Store Rejection Prevention''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Mobile 008_Application Security > 011_Application Vetting and
  Compliance > App Store Security Review > App Store Rejection Prevention). Base content on: Core concepts (App Store Guidelines,
  Rejection, Compliance); Completed Best Practices (full Apple sections: Safety incl. privacy/data; Performance; Business;
  Design + Google Play parallels); OWASP MASVS (STORAGE, CRYPTO, NETWORK, AUTH, PLATFORM, RESILIENCE, CODE); Research (high
  first-attempt failure rates, evolving guidelines).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Active Learning: Tie 20% flashcards to activities (e.g., scenario from problem-solving).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute evenly (10 per layer): Layer 1 Foundation, Layer 2 Components (full guidelines/MASVS), Layer 3
  Implementation checklists, Layer 4 Integration (CI/CD).

  - Voter Consensus (85.7%): Emphasize completeness (full guidelines), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression).


  Use Flashcard Schema exactly:

  [insert full schema above]


  Variety: 40% MCQ (distractors protocol), 20% Definition (REMEMBER), 20% Application (APPLY), 10% Analysis (ANALYZE), 10%
  Evaluation/Create. Ensure active recall, no hints on front. Output as numbered JSON array: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'':
  ''...'', ''back'': ''...''}]. Optimize for Anki/Quizlet: concise, spaced repetition-friendly.'
