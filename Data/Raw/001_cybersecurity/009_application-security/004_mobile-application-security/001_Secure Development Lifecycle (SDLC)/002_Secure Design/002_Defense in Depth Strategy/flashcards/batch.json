      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "NIST SP 1800-22 highlights that BYOD environments present unique challenges for Defense in Depth because organizations have less control over the security posture of personally owned devices. The diversity in operating systems, age, and user configurations makes consistent application of layered security controls difficult.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors suggest unrealistic uniformity, complete denial of access, or over-reliance on vendor defaults, missing the core challenge of managing diverse, user-controlled devices within a layered security framework.",
        "analogy": "Securing BYOD is like trying to ensure consistent safety standards across many different types of personal vehicles used for a company fleet – each has its own quirks and maintenance history."
