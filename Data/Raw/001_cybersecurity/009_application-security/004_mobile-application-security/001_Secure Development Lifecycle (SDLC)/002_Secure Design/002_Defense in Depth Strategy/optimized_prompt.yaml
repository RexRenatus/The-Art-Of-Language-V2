active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the effectiveness of DiD versus perimeter-only security for mobile apps
    facing modern threats like zero-day exploits. Use examples from real-world breaches (e.g., referencing CISA alerts) and
    reference the CIA triad to support your arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors: 1) Common misconception (e.g., equating DiD to firewalls only); 2) Partial

  ''Defense in Depth Strategy'' (Topic Hierarchy: Level 1: Cybersecurity; Level 2: 008_Application Security; Level 3: Mobile
  008_Application Security; Level 4: 003_Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC); Level 5: Secure Design; Level 6: Defense in
  Depth Strategy). Base content on this research summary: DiD uses multiple layered controls (physical, network, host, app,
  data) for redundancy/resilience, from military tactics; embedded in NIST CSF, ISO/IEC 27001, CISA pubs (e.g., ''Defense
  in Depth: Protecting National Infrastructure'' at cisa.gov); contrasts perimeter security; key for mobile SDLC Secure Design
  linking CIA triad.


  Incorporate: Prior knowledge (SDLC, CIA, firewalls); Scaffolding (Layer 1: Definitions; Layer 2: Layers/frameworks; Layer
  3: Mobile implementation steps; Layer 4: SDLC integration/concept map). Distribute across Bloom''s levels (4-6 objectives:
  Remember def; Understand layers; Apply to mobile; Analyze vs perimeter; Evaluate architecture; Create strategy). Promote
  active learning (e.g., scenario-based Qs).
