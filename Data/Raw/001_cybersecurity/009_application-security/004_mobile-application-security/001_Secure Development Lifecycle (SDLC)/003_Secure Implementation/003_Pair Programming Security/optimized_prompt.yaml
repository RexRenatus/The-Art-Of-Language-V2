  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of pair programming versus solo coding for addressing
    OWASP Mobile Top 10 vulnerabilities like M1 (Improper Platform Usage) in Android/iOS apps. Provide evidence from NIST
    SSDF on how collaboration reduces vulnerability impact.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
