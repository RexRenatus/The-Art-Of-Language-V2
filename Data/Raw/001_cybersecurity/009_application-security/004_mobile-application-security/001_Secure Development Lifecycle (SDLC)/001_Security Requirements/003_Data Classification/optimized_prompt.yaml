active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the classification of transient mobile data (e.g., temporary location caches) versus persistent
    user profiles (e.g., payment details). How does this impact Zero Trust implementation in mobile apps? Reference NIST SP
    800-207 and discuss real-world trade-offs in risk assessment and compliance (e.g., GDPR).
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student describes a mobile app data type (e.g., contact list sync, camera images, biometrics),
    classifies it per NIST/FIPS levels, and suggests controls. The partner teaches it back, addressing potential misconceptions
    like undervaluing 'internal use' data. Switch roles and discuss integration with SDLC security requirements.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A ride-sharing mobile app suffers a breach leaking trip history, payment details, and GPS data.
    Classify the leaked data using NIST levels, map to SDLC security requirements, propose mitigations (e.g., encryption,
    access controls), and evaluate compliance impacts (e.g., GDPR fines). Present solutions as a group.'

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full array from ''learning_objectives'' above]

  - Active Learning: [Insert summaries from ''active_learning'' above]

  - Scaffolding: Use 4 layers progressively [Insert full ''scaffolding_layers'' above].

  - Prioritize mobile examples (GPS, biometrics, caches), standards (NIST SP 800-207 zero-trust, FIPS 199 categorization),
  SDLC integration.


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards (10 Basic Q&A, 10 MCQ, 10 Application/Scenario) optimized for Anki/Quizlet. Follow exact
  schema:

  [Insert full ''flashcard_schema'' above].


  Ensure cards promote Bloom''s progression: 40% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate/Create. Use voter consensus
  (82.9% approval): Complete FIPS (low/moderate/high impact), real-world breaches, zero-trust.
