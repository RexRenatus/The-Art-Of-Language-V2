active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how device encryption requirements contribute to zero-trust architecture
    in enterprise MDM frameworks. Consider scenarios where encryption alone is insufficient (e.g., weak key management) and
    propose mitigations based on NIST SP 800-111 and SP 800-124 Rev. 2.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., ''Encryption protects data in transit only'' – confuses with TLS).'
    - 'Distractor 2: Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''FDE is always best'' – ignores file-level for low-risk).'
    - 'Distractor 3: Outdated/irrelevant standard (e.g., reference old NIST vs. SP 800-111).'
    - Ensure distractors are plausible for cybersecurity learners; avoid obvious errors.
    - 'Balance: 20% remember-level (definition), 30% understand/apply, 30% analyze/evaluate, 20% create (scenario-based).'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Device Encryption Requirements\
  \ (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Mobile 008_Application Security > 012_Mobile Device Management\
  \ (MDM) and Enterprise Security > Policy Enforcement > Device Encryption Requirements).\n\nUse the provided learning objectives,\
  \ active learning components, 4-layer scaffolding, and research context to generate 50 high-quality flashcards.\n\n**Key\
  \ Guidelines:**\n- Align flashcards to Bloom's Taxonomy (mix levels as in objectives).\n- Cover scaffolding layers evenly\
  \ (12-13 per layer).\n- Incorporate voter priorities: NIST SP 800-111 (storage encryption types/use cases), SP 800-124 Rev.\
  \ 2 (mobile MDM), CISA (FDE for endpoints), zero-trust/MDM integration.\n- Big Picture: Encryption enforces MDM policies,\
  \ mitigates theft/malware in enterprise risk management.\n\n**Output Format (JSON Array of Objects):**\n[\n  {\n    \"flashcard_id\"\
