  discussion_prompt: In an enterprise environment, should silent app installations be allowed under any circumstances? Debate
    the pros (e.g., efficiency in MDM for fleet management) vs. cons (e.g., malware risks via unauthorized software), citing
    NIST SP 800-167 and real-world examples from iOS/Android enterprise distribution.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Research Context: Silent app installation = apps installed without user consent (e.g., MDM push in Intune/Jamf for iOS/Android).
  Risks: Malware vectors, unauthorized SW. Controls: Application whitelisting (NIST SP 800-167: Guide to Application Whitelisting;
  NIST SP 800-163: MDM guidelines). Sources: NIST.gov/publications/guide-application-whitelisting-0; SentinelOne (silent installs
  as EDR blind spots, recommend runtime whitelisting).
