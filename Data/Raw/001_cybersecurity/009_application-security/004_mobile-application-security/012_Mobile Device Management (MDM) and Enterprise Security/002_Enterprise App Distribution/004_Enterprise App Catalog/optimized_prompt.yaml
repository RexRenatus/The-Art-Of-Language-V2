  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between user productivity and security when curating an
    Enterprise App Catalog. Provide examples of apps that might be controversial (e.g., productivity vs. high-risk apps) and
    justify inclusion/exclusion based on NIST CSF Protect function.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
