active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of mobile application security, debate the advantages and limitations of RBAC compared
    to Discretionary Access Control (DAC) or Mandatory Access Control (MAC). Provide real-world examples from recent data
    breaches (e.g., unauthorized access in mobile banking apps) where poor access control led to incidents, and discuss how
    RBAC aligns with zero-trust architecture and compliance standards like HIPAA or SOX.
  peer_teaching: 'Students pair up; one explains core RBAC components (users, roles, permissions, sessions) using a mobile
    banking app scenario (e.g., customer vs. teller roles), while the partner quizzes them on misconceptions (e.g., RBAC vs.
    ACLs). Then switch: the second student teaches hierarchical RBAC, separation of duties (SOD), and role activation using
    the same scenario.'
  problem_solving: In groups, design an RBAC system for a mobile e-commerce app handling sensitive customer data. Define at
    least 5 roles (e.g., customer, merchant, admin), assign permissions and scopes, enforce SOD constraints, and address misuse
    scenarios like insider threats. Groups present designs for peer critique, evaluating against least privilege and mobile-specific
    risks.
