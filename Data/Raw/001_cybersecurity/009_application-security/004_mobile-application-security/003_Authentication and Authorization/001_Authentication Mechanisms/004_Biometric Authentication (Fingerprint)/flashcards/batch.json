        "core_logic": "Secure enclaves/TEEs work by creating a separate, secure processing environment isolated from the main OS. This ensures that sensitive data like fingerprint templates are processed and stored within this protected space, making them inaccessible even if the main OS is compromised.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The first distractor broadens the scope beyond biometric data. The second assigns an unrelated function. The third suggests cloud interaction, contrary to the isolated, on-device nature of TEEs for biometrics.",
        "analogy": "A secure enclave is like a bank vault within a bank. The main OS is the bank lobby, but the vault (enclave) provides an extra layer of hardware-enforced security for the most sensitive assets (biometric data)."

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Effective enrollment works by capturing multiple high-quality fingerprint samples from different angles and positions. This process, guided by clear instructions, creates a more robust template, which in turn leads to better accuracy (lower FRR/FAR) and a smoother user experience during authentication.",

        "analogy": "Enrolling a fingerprint is like taking a detailed portrait for an ID. You wouldn't take a blurry, quick snapshot; you'd ensure multiple clear angles are captured to get the best possible likeness."
