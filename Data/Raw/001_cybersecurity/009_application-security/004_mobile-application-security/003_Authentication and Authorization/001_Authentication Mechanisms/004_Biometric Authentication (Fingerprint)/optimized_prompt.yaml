active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains the enrollment process (capture -> minutiae extraction -> template storage)
    while the other explains verification (1:1 matching); switch roles and use hand-drawn diagrams to teach back. Discuss
    common misconceptions like storing raw images.
  problem_solving: Design a mobile app authentication flow handling fingerprint failure (e.g., fallback to PIN/2FA), spoofing
    detection (PAD integration), and template protection (secure enclave). Include error handling for high FRR scenarios and
    justify choices against NIST SP 800-63-4 requirements.

  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM ''learning_objectives'']

  - Scaffolding layers: [PASTE FULL ''scaffolding'' DETAILS]

  - Active learning ties: Reference discussions/problems in explanations (e.g., ''Relates to spoofing debate'').

  - Big picture: Phishing-resistant ''something you are'' auth for mobile apps, NIST-compliant, links to passwords/2FA.

  - Sources: NIST SP 800-63-4 (AAL2/3 biometrics, PAD, syncable auth), Android/iOS docs.


  Use EXACT flashcard schema: Output JSON array of 30 flashcards. Each: {''front'': str, ''back'': {''answer'': str, ''explanation'':
  str, ''distractors'': [str,str,str] if MCQ else null}, ''metadata'': {''type'': str, ''bloom_level'': str, ''scaffolding_layer'':
  int, ''links_to_prior'': str}}.


  Ensure: Coverage across all objectives/layers; distractors per protocol; explanations scaffolded (foundation to integration);
  engaging for peer teaching/problems. No raw images/templates in answers. Promote critical thinking (e.g., risk evaluation).'
