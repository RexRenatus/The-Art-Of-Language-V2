active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the misconception that 'passwordless authentication means no security.'
    Use NIST SP 800-63B-4 guidelines to argue how mechanisms like passkeys and WebAuthn provide superior phishing resistance
    and AAL2+ assurance compared to passwords. Identify one real-world mobile app example and its potential vulnerabilities.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''passwordless =
    no MFA''); 2) Partial truths (e.g., ''WebAuthn uses passwords''); 3) Related but incorrect terms (e.g., AAL1 vs. AAL3);
    4) Voter-noted errors (e.g., biometrics equal without hardware). Ensure distractors teach by explaining errors.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 30-40 high-quality flashcards on ''Passwordless Authentication''
  (Category: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Mobile 008_Application Security > 003_Authentication and Authorization
  > Authentication Mechanisms > Passwordless Authentication).


  Incorporate these exactly:

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL OBJECTIVES ARRAY HERE]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [PASTE FULL LAYERS HERE] – Distribute cards evenly across 4 layers.

  - Active Learning: Tie explanations to components (e.g., ''Use in discussion on misconceptions'').

  - Topic Details: NIST SP 800-63-4/B (AAL1-3, FIDO2/WebAuthn/passkeys/biometrics/magic links), mobile (Android Keystore/iOS
  Secure Enclave), vulnerabilities, pros/cons, best practices (phishing resistance, recovery).
