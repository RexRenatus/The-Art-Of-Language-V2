active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether the convenience of keyboard autofill in mobile apps (e.g., password
    managers or banking apps) outweighs the security risks of cache leakage. Cite real-world examples, reference NIST SP 800-63-4
    on memorized secrets, and propose mitigations such as secure input flags.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate high-quality, Anki-optimized flashcards
  on ''Keyboard Cache Security'' (Category: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Mobile 008_Application Security; Entry:
  004_Secure Data Storage > Data Leakage Prevention). Voter consensus: 100% approval on completeness, pedagogy, etc.


  **Full Research Context:** Keyboard cache security addresses temporary keystroke storage risks at OS (input editing), app
  (autofill), hardware (buffers), and browser levels. Vulnerabilities: memory scraping, app flaws, physical dumps, side-channels.
  Mitigations: disable autofill/suggestions, secure flags (Android InputType.TYPE_TEXT_VARIATION_PASSWORD | NO_SUGGESTIONS;
  iOS UITextInputPasswordRules), clear caches post-input, memory obfuscation. Standards: NIST SP 800-63-4 (Digital Identity
  Guidelines: secure memorized secrets, verifiers protect against keyloggers/memory scraping); NIST CSF Protect (PR.DS-5);
  OWASP Mobile Top 10 M2 (Insecure Data Storage), MASVS. Compliance: GDPR/PCI-DSS. Sources: NIST SP 800-63B/63-4, OWASP docs,
  Android/iOS dev guides, Frida tooling.
