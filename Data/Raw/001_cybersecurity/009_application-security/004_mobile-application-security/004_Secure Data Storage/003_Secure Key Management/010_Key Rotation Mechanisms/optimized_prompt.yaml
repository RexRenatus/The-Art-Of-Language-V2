  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of key rotation frequency (e.g., daily vs. monthly) in
    mobile apps: How does it balance security against battery drain and user experience? Reference NIST SP 800-57 and real-world
    breaches like the 2023 MOVEit vulnerability.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Core content from research: Key rotation = periodic update of crypto keys/API keys/OAuth to limit exposure. Mitigates stale
  credentials/key compromise. NIST SP 800-57 Pt1 Rev5: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/57/pt1/r5/final; Pt2: policy/planning.
  OWASP Mobile Top 10 M5. Mobile: Android Keystore/iOS Keychain. Steps: generate/distribute/migrate/decommission. Sources:
  NIST links, OWASP MASVS.


  Prerequisites: Builds on Secure Key Management (generation/storage). Big picture: Reduces breach impact in mobile secure
  storage lifecycle.


  Output EXACTLY as JSON array of objects matching this schema [insert flashcard_schema.structure here]. Strictly follow distractor
  protocol. Cover all Bloom''s levels/layers proportionally. Each card: active recall, explanation with pedagogy tie-in (e.g.,
  ''Applies Layer3 by...''), sources. No extra text.'
