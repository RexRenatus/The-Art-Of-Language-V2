active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare the Secure Enclave in iOS to ARM TrustZone in Android devices. What are the advantages (e.g.,
    hardware isolation) and potential vulnerabilities (e.g., side-channel attacks) of hardware-based TEEs versus software-only
    key management solutions? Discuss in groups and present key trade-offs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  content: 'Just-in-time quiz: What is a coprocessor?

    - Secure Enclave: Dedicated, isolated security coprocessor in Apple''s SoC (e.g., A-series chips). Physically separate
    from main CPU.

    - Core functions: Stores cryptographic keys (symmetric/asymmetric), processes biometrics (Touch ID/Face ID templates never
    leave), aids secure boot.

    - Key principle: Hardware isolation ensures keys/data never exposed to OS or apps, even if compromised.'
- level: 2
  name: Layer 2
  focus: ''
  content: 'Just-in-time quiz: How does Secure Enclave differ from software key stores?

    - Isolation: Own memory, secure firmware; no shared bus with main processor.

    - Relations: Similar to HSMs (tamper-resistant, FIPS-aligned) and TEEs (e.g., ARM TrustZone).

    - Additional: Secure Intent (channel for main CPU to request ops), role in secure boot chain.'

    2. Generate key pair: SecKeyGeneratePair with kSecAttrTokenIDSecureEnclave.\n3. Store/use: SecItemAdd to Keychain (backed\
    \ by Enclave), perform ops via SecKeyCreateEncryptedData.\nExample code:\n```swift\nlet attributes: [String: Any] = [\n\
    \    kSecAttrTokenID as String: kSecAttrTokenIDSecureEnclave,\n    // ... other attrs\n]\nSecKeyGeneratePair(attributes\
    \ as CFDictionary, &publicKey, &privateKey)\n```\nBest practices: Use biometric auth (LAContext), avoid key export."

  content: 'Just-in-time quiz: How does Secure Enclave integrate with Keychain?

    - With Keychain: Hardware-backed items (class kSecClassKey, tokenIDSecureEnclave).

    - Secure Boot: Verifies boot chain integrity.

    - App optimization: Combine with LocalAuthentication for biometrics; use for secure messaging (e.g., iMessage encryption).

    - Advanced: Handle side-channels (timing/power analysis mitigations in firmware).'
