  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of mandating hardware-backed Key Attestation for all app-generated
    keys: Does it sufficiently protect against advanced persistent threats (e.g., rooted devices or supply-chain attacks)?
    Provide evidence from Android/iOS documentation and propose mitigations for identified weaknesses.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors: (1) Common misconception (e.g., telecom SHAKEN), (2) Partial truth (e.g., software
      keystore only), (3) Edge case inversion (e.g., exportable keys).'
    - Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter feedback (avoid telecom mix-ups).
    - 'Balance difficulty: 1 easy (obvious wrong), 1 medium (requires understanding), 1 hard (subtle difference).'

  Key Attestation in mobile apps (Android Keystore TEE/StrongBox, iOS Secure Enclave).

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use for inspiration in explanations (e.g., tie to discussion debates).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers: Foundation (Layer 1), Components (Layer 2), Implementation (Layer
  3), Integration (Layer 4). Label each flashcard with its layer and Bloom''s level.


  Generate flashcards per this SCHEMA:

  [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"layer": "1", "blooms_level": "REMEMBER", "front": "Question text", "back":
  {"correct_answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "distractors_explained": {...}, "reference": "..."}}


  Ensure accuracy: Base on official sources (developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/keystore#Attestation, Apple Secure
  Enclave docs). High pedagogical value: Scaffold from basic recall to creative design.'
