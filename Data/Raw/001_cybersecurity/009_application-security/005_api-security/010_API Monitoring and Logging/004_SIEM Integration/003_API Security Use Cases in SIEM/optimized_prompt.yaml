active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the effectiveness of SIEM versus API gateways (e.g., WAFs) for detecting
    OWASP API Top 10 risks like Broken Object Level Authorization. Provide evidence from NIST SP 800-228 and real-world enterprise
    examples, considering trade-offs in scalability for microservices architectures.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
