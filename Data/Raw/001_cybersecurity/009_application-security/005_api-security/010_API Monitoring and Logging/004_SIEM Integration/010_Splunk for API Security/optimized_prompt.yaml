active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages of using Splunk for SIEM integration in API security monitoring
    versus native API gateway tools (e.g., Apigee or Kong). Reference OWASP API Top 10 risks, NIST SP 800-228 guidelines,
    and real-world challenges like log volume in cloud-native systems. Support your arguments with pros/cons and propose measurable
    KPIs for evaluation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - D1: Common misconception (e.g., confuse OWASP risks).

    - D2: Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., wrong Splunk component).

    - D3: Unrelated but similar term (e.g., mix NIST with OWASP).

    Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter-noted pitfalls like confusing log ingestion steps or OWASP categories.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Splunk for API Security.
  Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 006_API Security > 010_API Monitoring and Logging > SIEM Integration
  > Splunk for 006_API Security. Use this context, voter consensus (82.9% approval: emphasize Splunk ingestion/SPL/OWASP/NIST,
  hands-on labs, prerequisites like basic SIEM/API logging), and research (APIs, API Security, Cloud-Native, NIST SP 800-228,
  OWASP API Top 10, Splunk ES for log analysis/dashboards/alerts/ML).


  Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives [insert learning_objectives array here], active learning [discussion/peer/problem-solving],
  4-layer scaffolding [insert scaffolding here]. Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (balanced across layers/Bloom''s: 20%
  L1/Remember-Understand, 30% L2/Apply, 25% L3/Analyze, 25% L4/Evaluate-Create; 40% Splunk SPL/queries, 30% OWASP mapping,
  20% ingestion/dashboards, 10% integration).


  Strictly follow flashcard_schema [insert schema here]. Ensure flashcards promote active recall, problem-solving (e.g., ''Write
  SPL for...''), and tie to hands-on Splunk labs. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, no extra text.'
