active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the role of uptime monitoring in preventing revenue loss for an e-commerce
    API (e.g., during Black Friday). How does it balance Availability in the CIA triad with security risks like exposing heartbeat
    endpoints? Cite real-world examples from sources like UptimeRobot case studies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - '3 distractors per MCQ: Plausible based on common errors (e.g., mix synthetic/RUM; Ping checks app logic).'
    - One near-miss (similar but incomplete), one opposite, one unrelated.
    - Avoid 'all/none' options.
    - Ensure 25% correct by position randomization.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom''s Taxonomy, active
  learning, and scaffolding for optimal retention. Topic: Uptime Monitoring (Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 006_API
  Security > 010_API Monitoring and Logging > Security Monitoring > Uptime Monitoring). Use provided research (definitions,
  synthetic/RUM, checks: HTTP/HTTPS/Ping/Heartbeat/etc., tools like UptimeRobot), voter consensus (complete Heartbeat: app
  sends periodic HTTP to monitor; add tools/best practices/security links), and big picture (CIA Availability, API revenue
  protection).

  - Scaffolding layers: [INSERT scaffolding OBJECT HERE]

  - Active learning ties where relevant.


  Generate flashcards per schema: [INSERT flashcard_schema HERE]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, 40-60 total, covering
  all layers/objectives evenly. Ensure API security focus, distractors from misconceptions (e.g., Ping verifies API responses).
  Explanations reference hierarchy/research/voters.'
