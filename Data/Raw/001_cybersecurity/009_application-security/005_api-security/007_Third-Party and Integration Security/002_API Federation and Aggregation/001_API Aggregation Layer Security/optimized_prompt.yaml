active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs between implementing a centralized API aggregation layer versus decentralized
    API calls in terms of security, performance, and scalability for a cloud-native e-commerce platform. Reference specific
    OWASP API Security Top 10 risks (e.g., Broken Function Level Authorization) and NIST SP 800-228 controls to debate which
    approach is superior, considering zero-trust principles.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions (e.g., ''Aggregation layers
    are secure by default'' → distractor: ''No auth needed''; real: ''Requires centralized authz''). Draw from OWASP risks
    (e.g., confuse BOLA with BFLOA), partial truths (e.g., ''Rate limiting only at backend''), or opposites (e.g., ''Decentralized
    is always more secure''). Ensure distractors teach via contrast.'

  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 006_API Security > 008_Third-Party and Integration Security
  > API Federation and Aggregation > API Aggregation Layer Security). Generate high-quality, pedagogically optimized flashcards
  using university-style methods: Bloom''s Taxonomy (via provided objectives), active learning (discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving),
  4-layer scaffolding (foundation/components/implementation/integration), and research-grounded content (NIST SP 800-228:
  Guidelines for API Protection in Cloud-Native Systems; OWASP API Security Top 10 2023; ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Information Security
  Management; ISO/IEC 27002:2022 Best Practices).

  ISO/IEC 27001 (https://www.iso.org/standard/27001); ISO/IEC 27002 (https://www.iso.org/standard/27002).


  Best Practices: Centralized authz (OAuth/JWT), aggregated rate limiting, request validation, runtime monitoring (Kong/Apigee),
  defense-in-depth.


  Concept Map: Central ''API Aggregation Layer Security'' → OWASP Risks (BOLA/BFLA), NIST Controls, Components (gateways),
  Zero-Trust Integration.


  Big Picture: Enables secure API federation in distributed systems, core to Application Security.
