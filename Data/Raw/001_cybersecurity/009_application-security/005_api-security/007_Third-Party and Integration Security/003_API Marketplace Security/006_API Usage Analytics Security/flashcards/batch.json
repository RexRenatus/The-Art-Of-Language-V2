        "core_logic": "NIST SP 800-228 emphasizes that API protection includes securing the data generated by APIs, such as usage analytics.

The second focuses on standardization, which is good practice but not the primary security concern for the analytics data. The third focuses on a specific analytics feature, not the fundamental security of the data itself.",
        "analogy": "Think of API usage analytics like security camera footage. While it's important to have cameras (analytics collection) and clear images (standardized logs), the most critical aspect is ensuring the footage itself isn't erased or altered by intruders (unauthorized access/tampering)."

Integrating API usage analytics allows security teams to see API-related threats in the context of other security alerts (e.g., network intrusions, endpoint compromises). This correlation provides a comprehensive understanding of potential attacks, enabling faster and more effective incident response because it connects disparate pieces of information. Therefore, holistic threat visibility is the key benefit.",
