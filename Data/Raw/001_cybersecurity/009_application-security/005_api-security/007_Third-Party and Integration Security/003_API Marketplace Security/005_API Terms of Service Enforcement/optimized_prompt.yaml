active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of API marketplaces, debate whether automated ToS enforcement (e.g., rate limiting, anomaly
    detection) adequately protects providers compared to manual review. Use NIST SP 800-228 as reference and discuss trade-offs
    in privacy, accuracy, and user experience.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Prerequisites:** Basic API concepts, general ToS, cybersecurity monitoring.


  **Completed Research Context:** API ToS enforcement ensures APIs are used per legal agreements and security policies. Core
  Concepts: API (rules for software communication); ToS (rules on usage, rate limits, data handling); Enforcement (monitoring,
  detection, mitigation); Cloud-Native (microservices, containers). Standards: NIST SP 800-228 ''Guidelines for API Protection
  for Cloud-Native Systems'' (June 2025: threat modeling, access control, encryption, logging/monitoring, rate limiting, anomaly
  detection); NIST CSF (Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover); OWASP API Security Top 10 (broken auth, excessive data exposure);
  ISO 27001 (compliance). Best Practices: API gateways (rate limiting), tools (Splunk/ELK for logs), ML for anomalies, zero-trust.
  Sources: NIST SP 800-228 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-228.pdf); OWASP API Security

  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the exact array from ''learning_objectives'' above].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the exact array from ''scaffolding'' above].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Reference discussion/problem-solving/peer activities in explanations to encourage use (e.g.,
  ''Discuss in peer teaching: ...'').


  **Flashcard Generation Rules:**

  - Produce exactly 30 flashcards covering all layers/objectives proportionally.

  - Use exact ''flashcard_schema'' structure for each.

  - Ensure progressive difficulty: early cards foundational, later integrative.

  - Questions active/recall-oriented (e.g., ''What is...'', ''Apply to scenario...'', ''Design...'').

  - Explanations tie to research, objectives, layers; suggest active learning links.

  - Voter Consensus: 82.9% approval; prioritize completeness, pedagogy, progression.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 30 flashcards: [{''type'': ''...'', ''question'': ''...'', ''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''distractors'': [...], ''tags'': [...]}]. No extra text.'
