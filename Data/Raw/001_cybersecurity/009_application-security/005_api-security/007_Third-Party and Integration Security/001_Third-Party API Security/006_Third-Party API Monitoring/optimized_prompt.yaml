active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the top three OWASP API Security Top 10 risks for third-party APIs (e.g., Broken Authentication,
    BOLA, Unrestricted Resource Consumption) and propose tailored monitoring strategies for each, considering real-world examples
    like supply chain attacks.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) using a real-world example such as the
    SolarWinds supply chain attack involving third-party APIs; then switch roles and have the partner quiz the explainer on
    key monitoring controls.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A company integrates a third-party payment API (e.g., Stripe). Identify monitoring gaps (e.g.,
    SSRF vulnerabilities), simulate an attack vector like excessive rate limiting bypass, and design a detection dashboard
    with logging, alerting, and anomaly detection.'
