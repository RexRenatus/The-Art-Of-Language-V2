active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent should an organization's risk appetite dictate vendor selection over technical capabilities?
    Debate using NIST C-SCRM guidelines (SP 800-161r1), incorporating real-world examples like the SolarWinds supply chain
    attack or MOVEit breach.
  peer_teaching: Pair students to explain Vendor Security Assessment (VSA) vs. Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM);
    one teaches the differences (e.g., VSA focuses on direct vendor controls, C-SCRM on full supply chain), then switch roles
    and quiz each other with examples from PCI DSS or SOC 2.
  problem_solving: Provide a mock vendor profile and questionnaire (e.g., responses on encryption, access controls, and monitoring);
    students calculate a risk score, recommend acceptance/rejection, and justify using NIST C-SCRM tiers, citing potential
    breaches like MOVEit.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Vendor Security Evaluation
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 006_API Security > 008_Third-Party and Integration Security
  > Third-Party 006_API Security > Vendor Security Evaluation). Generate 50 high-quality, spaced-repetition-optimized flashcards
  covering all Bloom''s levels and 4 scaffolding layers.


  **Content Foundation:** Use provided core concepts (VSA, C-SCRM [NIST SP 800-161r1, csrc.nist.gov], Third-Party Risk, Risk
  Appetite), standards (PCI DSS v4.0 Req. 12.8 [pcisecuritystandards.org], ISO 27001 A.15, SOC 2), examples (SolarWinds supply
  chain attack, MOVEit breach), sources ([auditboard.com], [netguru.com], [sprinto.com]).


  **Learning Objectives:** Ensure coverage: [insert full list from ''learning_objectives''].


  **Scaffolding Coverage:** Distribute evenly: Layer 1 Foundation (20%), Layer 2 Components (20%), Layer 3 Implementation
  (30%), Layer 4 Integration (30%).


  **Active Learning Integration:** Infuse prompts inspired by: Discussion on risk appetite vs. capabilities (NIST); Peer teaching
  VSA vs. C-SCRM; Problem-solving mock vendor assessment.


  **Flashcard Schema:** Output as JSON array of objects matching exact schema: {''type'', ''front'', ''back'': {''answer'',
  ''explanation'', ''hints'', ''bloom_level''}, ''tags''}. Follow distractor protocol strictly. Promote active recall: Questions
  should not give away answers.


  **Best Practices:** University pedagogy (progressive complexity), web-grounded (cite sources), voter consensus (completeness,
  real examples). Output ONLY the JSON array, no extra text.'
