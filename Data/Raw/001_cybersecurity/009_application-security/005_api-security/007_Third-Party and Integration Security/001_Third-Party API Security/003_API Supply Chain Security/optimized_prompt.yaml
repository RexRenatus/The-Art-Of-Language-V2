active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate whether organizations should prioritize full supply chain visibility (per NIST SP 800-161r1) over
    speed in API integrations. Use recent incidents like SolarWinds (malicious code insertion) and Log4j (Log4Shell vulnerability
    in API dependencies) as case studies. Compare/contrast acquirer vs. supplier perspectives, considering trade-offs in API
    security.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Core Content (from NIST SP 800-161r1-upd1 and sources): C-SCRM manages cybersecurity risks in supply chains for acquired
  tech. Ecosystem: acquirers, suppliers, developers, integrators, service providers across lifecycle. Risks: malicious functionality,
  counterfeits, vulnerabilities (API ex: Log4j/Log4Shell in deps, SolarWinds backdoor, XZ Utils tampering). Mitigations: SBOM,
  vetting, monitoring in DevSecOps.


  Learning Objectives: [Insert the 6 objectives above].

  Scaffolding Layers: [Insert the 4 layers above].

  Active Learning: Use examples from activities (e.g., SolarWinds debate, Log4Shell scenario) for relatability.


  Generate 25 flashcards following the exact schema:

  - Front: Question

  - Back: {answer, explanation (cite NIST/real ex), distractors (3 w/ why wrong), scaffolding_layer, related_objectives, active_learning_tie_in}

  Balance: 5/layer, Bloom''s progression, 50% MCQ w/ distractors per protocol.

  Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}}, ...]. Ensure API-focus, high pedagogy (Bloom''s,
  active recall), no criminal content.'
