active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the role of external API data validation in defense-in-depth strategies
    for third-party integrations. Provide examples of how failures contributed to supply chain attacks (e.g., SolarWinds),
    and propose mitigations linking to OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities like Injection and XSS.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate research: Core concepts (input validation, external sources, API gateway), goals (prevent malformed data, vulns
  like XSS/SQLi/DoS), strategies (syntactic regex e.g. email `/^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/`, semantic
  e.g. age 0-120), OWASP (https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html: whitelisting,
  reject bad). Prior knowledge: OWASP Top 10 Injection/XSS. Big picture: Defense-in-depth for third-party integrations, supply
  chain attack prevention.
