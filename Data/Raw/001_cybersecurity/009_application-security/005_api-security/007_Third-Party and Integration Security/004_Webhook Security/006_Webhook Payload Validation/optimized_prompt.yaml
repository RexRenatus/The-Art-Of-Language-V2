active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the risks of relying solely on HTTPS for webhook security versus implementing HMAC signatures.
    Which threats does each mitigate (e.g., eavesdropping vs. tampering), and in what scenarios (e.g., internal vs. external
    providers) would you choose one over the other? Discuss in groups and debate trade-offs.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains and demonstrates HMAC signature validation using a Python code snippet (provided).
    The listener then teaches back a variation incorporating timestamp/nonce for replay protection, switching roles.
  problem_solving: Provide groups with flawed webhook receiver code (e.g., no signature check, missing rate limiting). Identify
    vulnerabilities, implement fixes (HMAC, schema validation, IP allowlist), and test against spoofed/tampered payloads using
    tools like Postman. Present findings.

    Base on voter-noted misconceptions and threats.'

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM ''learning_objectives'']

  - Active Learning: Use activities for higher-order flashcards (e.g., scenario-based Qs from discussion/problem-solving).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers (tag each with Layer 1-4).

  - Best Practices: Cover HMAC verification, IP allowlisting, timestamp/nonce (replay protection), JSON Schema validation,
  rate limiting, logging/monitoring, HTTPS/TLS.

  - Threats: Spoofing, tampering, replay, eavesdropping, DoS, secret leakage.

  - Big Picture: Prevents supply chain attacks in microservices.

  - Prior Knowledge: Assume HTTP/HTTPS, basic crypto.

  - Include Python/Node.js code snippets in relevant cards.

  - Sources: OWASP API Security, industry standards.
