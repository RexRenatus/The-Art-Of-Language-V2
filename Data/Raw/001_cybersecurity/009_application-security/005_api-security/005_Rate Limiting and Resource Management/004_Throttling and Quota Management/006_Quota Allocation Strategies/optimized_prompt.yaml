active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between fixed quotas (e.g., 1000 requests/day per user)
    and dynamic strategies like token bucket in high-traffic APIs. Consider scenarios from OWASP API Security Top 10, such
    as preventing Broken Object Level Authorization through resource limits. What metrics (e.g., latency, fairness) should
    guide the choice?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
