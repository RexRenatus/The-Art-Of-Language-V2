active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between query complexity limiting and traditional rate limiting. Provide examples
    of DoS attacks where one mechanism fails but the other succeeds, such as a single highly complex GraphQL query overwhelming
    resources despite low request volume.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Plausible alternatives based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse query complexity with request rate).
    - Over-generalizations (e.g., 'All rate limiting covers complexity' – false).
    - Edge cases (e.g., valid simple query vs. complex one).
    - Partial truths (e.g., 'Only for GraphQL' when applicable to SQL too).
    - 1-2 distractors per card from voter-noted issues like equating queries equally.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Topic: ''Query Complexity Limiting'' (Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 006_API Security > 005_Rate Limiting and Resource Management > Resource Consumption
  Control > Query Complexity Limiting). Use the provided research context, enhanced with OWASP ASVS v4 C3: Secure Database
  Access (limits query resources to prevent exhaustion), GraphQL best practices (maxDepth, maxComplexity), SQL (timeouts,
  row limits, EXPLAIN), real-world cases (GitHub GraphQL DoS), NIST SP 800-53 SC controls.


  Core Concepts: Query complexity limiting prevents DoS/resource exhaustion by capping computational cost (joins, depth, rows).
  Differs from rate limiting (volume vs. per-query cost).
