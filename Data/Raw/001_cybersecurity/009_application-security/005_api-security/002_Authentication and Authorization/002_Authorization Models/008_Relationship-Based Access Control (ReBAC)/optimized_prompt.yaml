  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema provided. Cover all scaffolding layers evenly (5-7 per layer),
  distribute across Bloom''s levels per objectives, and incorporate active learning for deeper recall. Synthesize content
  from this comprehensive summary (complete truncated sections per voter consensus):


  **Full ReBAC Content:**

  ReBAC grants access based on entity relationships in a graph, enabling fine-grained, dynamic authz. Differs from RBAC (roles)
  and ABAC (attributes) by focusing on traversable connections.


  **Core Concepts:** Entities (users/resources), Relationships (edges: parent-child, member, owner), Policies (relation-based
  rules), Graph DB for traversal.


  **Prior Knowledge:** RBAC: User → Role → Permission. ABAC: Attributes match policies. ReBAC builds with relations (e.g.,
  user member_of team → team owner doc → user accesses doc).


  **Common Models/Use Cases:**

  - Google Zanzibar: Relation tuples (doc#edit@team), computed via unions/exclusions; powers Drive/YouTube.

  - Parent-Child: Hierarchical (org → dept → employee; access propagates via traversal).

  - Social Networks: Friends/followers graphs.

  - SaaS: Multi-tenant workspaces/projects/docs.


  **Implementation:** 1. Graph model. 2. Policy lang (e.g., ''viewer if parent.viewer or member.viewer_group''). 3. Traverse/query.


  **API Integration:** Caching for perf, middleware checks.


  Use learning_objectives, active_learning prompts, and scaffolding_layers to tag/align flashcards. Ensure explanations reference
  real-world (Zanzibar/org hierarchies), critique trade-offs.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''front'': {...}, ''back'': {...}}, ...]. No extra text.'
