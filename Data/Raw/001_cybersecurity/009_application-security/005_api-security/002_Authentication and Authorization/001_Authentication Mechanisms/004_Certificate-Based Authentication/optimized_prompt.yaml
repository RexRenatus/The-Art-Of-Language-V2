active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the role of certificate-based authentication in zero-trust architectures
    for reducing phishing risks in API security. Reference case studies like the DigiNotar CA breach or Heartbleed vulnerability,
    and evaluate trade-offs versus traditional authentication methods.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (2) Omit revocation (CRL/OCSP); (3) Mix with other auth (passwords, JWT); (4) Ignore mutual auth vs one-way; (5) Misstate
    NIST/OAuth integrations. Ensure plausibility from research context.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Certificate-Based Authentication
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 006_API Security > 003_Authentication and Authorization > Authentication
  Mechanisms > Certificate-Based Authentication). Synthesize 25-35 high-quality flashcards optimized for spaced repetition
  and university-level pedagogy.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL ARRAY FROM ''learning_objectives'']

  - Active Learning: [PASTE FULL OBJECT FROM ''active_learning'']

  - Scaffolding: [PASTE FULL ARRAY FROM ''scaffolding''] (Distribute flashcards: 30% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 20%
  Layer 4; span all Bloom''s levels evenly).

  - Research Context: Certificate-based auth uses digital certificates/PKI for identity verification via CA-issued public
  keys. Process: Issuance > TLS handshake > mutual auth. Key terms: Digital cert, PKI, CA, public/private keys. Integrations:
  mTLS for APIs, OAuth, zero-trust. Risks: CA compromise (DigiNotar). Standards: NIST SP 800-63-4 (Digital Identity Guidelines),
  RFC 8446 (TLS 1.3), X.509, OAuth 2.0 Proof-of-Possession (RFC 8705). Case studies: DigiNotar hack, Heartbleed. Sources:
  NIST.gov (SP 800-63), IETF RFCs, OWASP API Security.


  Generate flashcards following EXACT Flashcard Schema: [PASTE FULL ''flashcard_schema'']. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards,
  e.g., [{''id'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}}]. Ensure variety: 60% MCQ (4 options), 20% cloze, 20% short-answer.
  Cover prior knowledge links, big picture (zero-trust/NIST), and voter priorities (pedagogy, completeness).'
