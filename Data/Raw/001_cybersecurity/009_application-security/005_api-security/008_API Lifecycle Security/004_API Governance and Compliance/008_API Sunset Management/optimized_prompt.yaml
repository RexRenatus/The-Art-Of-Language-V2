  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''sunset means immediate shutdown''),
    2) Partial truth (e.g., ''only security teams handle it''), 3) Related concept mix-up (e.g., confuse with API versioning).
    Ensure plausible for cybersecurity learners.'
