  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active learning: Use prompts to inspire scenario flashcards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [PASTE FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM ABOVE].

  - Research context: Automated gates as SDLC checkpoints (AppSec, CI/CD integration, OWASP ASVS, ISO/IEC 27034 for app sec).
  Examples: SAST/DAST/SCA for OWASP Top 10 in APIs.


  Follow flashcard schema exactly [PASTE FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Output 75 flashcards as a JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'',
