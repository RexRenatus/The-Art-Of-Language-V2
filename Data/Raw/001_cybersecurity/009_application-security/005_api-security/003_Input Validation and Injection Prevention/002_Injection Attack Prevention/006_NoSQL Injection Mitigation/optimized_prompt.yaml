  discussion_prompt: 'Compare SQL injection and NoSQL injection. Debate if NoSQL''s flexibility (e.g., dynamic schemas and
    procedural queries) increases or decreases injection risks, using real-world examples from MongoDB (e.g., {$ne: null}
    auth bypass) and Cassandra. Address the misconception that ''NoSQL is immune to injections.'''
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Content Sources:**

  - Research: NoSQL Injection exploits procedural queries (e.g., MongoDB {$ne: null} bypass). Mitigations (OWASP NoSQL Injection
  Prevention Cheat Sheet): Input validation (whitelists, sanitization), parameterized queries (MongoDB: db.users.find({username:
  username}), Cassandra prepared stmts), avoid $where/eval, ORMs (Mongoose), schema validation. Vulnerable: db.collection(''users'').find({username:
  req.query.user, password: req.query.pass}). Secure: Use $eq or bind vars.

  - Prior Knowledge: Builds on SQL Injection (string-based vs. object-based).

  - Sources: OWASP NoSQL Cheat Sheet (https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/NoSQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html),
