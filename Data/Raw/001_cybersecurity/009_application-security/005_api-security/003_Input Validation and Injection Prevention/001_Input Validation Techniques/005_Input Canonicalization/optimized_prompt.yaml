active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how differences in locale and Unicode encoding can bypass input validation
    without canonicalization. Propose and critique mitigations, referencing real-world examples like HTTP Request Smuggling
    in APIs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., canonicalization vs. sanitization/escaping), 2) Partial truths (e.g., ''normalize after validation''), 3) Edge-case
    errors (e.g., wrong Unicode form like NFD instead of NFC). Ensure distractors are realistic from research context (e.g.,
    locale pitfalls).'

  (Level 6 in Cybersecurity hierarchy).


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for spaced repetition (Anki-style). Cover all Bloom''s levels via learning
  objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]. Structure content across 4 scaffolding layers: [INSERT scaffolding
  ARRAY HERE]. Incorporate active learning hooks (e.g., questions prompting discussion/problem-solving).


  Use this research context: Input canonicalization standardizes data (e.g., Unicode normalization to NFC) before validation
  to prevent attacks like injection/HTTP smuggling. Key standards: OWASP Input Validation Cheat Sheet, ASVS V5.1.2, NIST SP
  800-53 SC-18, CWE-180. Sources: owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide, nvlpubs.nist.gov.


  Output EXACTLY in JSON array of objects, each following this schema: [INSERT flashcard_schema.structure HERE].


  Balance: 10 cards/Layer, span Bloom''s (8 Remember/Understand, 20 Apply/Analyze, 22 Evaluate/Create). 40% MCQ with distractors
  per protocol: [INSERT distractor_protocol HERE]. Ensure measurable action verbs, prior knowledge links (e.g., to injection
  prevention), code snippets, real-world API examples. Make explanations pedagogical, tying to objectives/standards.'
