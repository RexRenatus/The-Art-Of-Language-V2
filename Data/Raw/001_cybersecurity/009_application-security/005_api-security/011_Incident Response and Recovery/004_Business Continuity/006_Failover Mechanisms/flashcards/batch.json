        "core_logic": "The distinction between hot and cold standby is crucial for RTO because a hot standby is already running and synchronized, enabling immediate failover, whereas a cold standby requires time to start and sync, leading to a longer recovery time.",

        "analogy": "A hot standby is like a fully fueled and ready race car waiting on the grid; a cold standby is like a car in the garage that needs to be brought out, fueled, and started before it can race."
