active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how root cause analysis from an API security incident (e.g., broken authentication
    from OWASP API Top 10) should inform NIST SP 800-53 control enhancements. What trade-offs exist between enhanced security
    and operational performance? Provide evidence from real-world breaches.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Extreme: Overly simplistic or non-existent controls.'
    - 'Balance: Ensure 60% test recall/understanding, 20% application, 20% analysis/evaluation.'
    quantity: 3 distractors per card; generate 50-100 cards total, distributed across layers (15% L1, 25% L2, 30% L3, 30%

  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list above].

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full layers above, including content/sources].

  **Active Learning Tie-ins:** Incorporate elements like scenario-based questions from discussion/problem-solving.

  **Output Format (JSON array of objects):** Each flashcard: {"front": "Question A) Opt1 B) Opt2 C) Opt3 D) Opt4", "back":
  "**A** (explanation with rationale, why distractors wrong, example, source, Bloom''s tag: e.g., APPLY, Layer: 3)."}

  **Schema Rules:** [Insert full flashcard_schema above]. Ensure API-specific (OAuth, rate limiting, OWASP), incident recovery
  links, NIST SP 800-53 focus (families, baselines, enhancements). Vary Bloom''s: 30% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze,
  40% Evaluate/Create. Distribute: 15% Layer1, etc. Citations: NIST SP 800-53 Rev.5 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final),
  OWASP API Top 10 (https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/). Make distractors per protocol. Output only valid JSON array.'
