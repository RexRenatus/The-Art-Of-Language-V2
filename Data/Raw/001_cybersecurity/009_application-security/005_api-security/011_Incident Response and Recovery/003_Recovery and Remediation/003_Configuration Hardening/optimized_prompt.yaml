active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a debate format, argue whether 'Secure by Default' principles should be mandatory for all API vendors.
    Consider usability trade-offs, development speed, and real-world examples from breaches like SolarWinds or Log4j. Address
    the misconception that hardening inevitably slows development.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Hardening increases
    usability'' vs. reduces attack surface); 2) Partial truths (e.g., ''Use full-featured OS'' vs. minimal); 3) Real-world
    errors (e.g., from SolarWinds: ignore default configs); 4) Contrasting frameworks (e.g., NIST vs. outdated practice).
    Ensure distractors teach by explaining errors.'

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using this pedagogy:


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s Taxonomy):** [insert full list above].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [insert full scaffolding descriptions above]. Ensure 6-7 cards per layer, progressing from foundation
  to integration.


  **Active Learning Integration:** Weave in elements like debate on Secure by Default (SolarWinds), peer teach-back (non-examples),
  problem-solving (Log4j API recovery with Docker/K8s/ACSC).


  **Flashcard Schema:** [insert full schema above]. Output ONLY in JSON array of objects: [{''type'': ''MCQ|Q/A|Cloze'', ''front'':
