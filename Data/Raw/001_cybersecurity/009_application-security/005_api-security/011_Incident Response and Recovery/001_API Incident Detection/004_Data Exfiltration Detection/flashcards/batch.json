By allowing only permitted protocols and destinations, it significantly reduces the attack surface for data leaving the network. This works by defining explicit rules for outbound traffic.",

        "core_logic": "Data Loss Prevention (DLP) systems are crucial for exfiltration detection as they actively monitor, detect, and block unauthorized attempts to move sensitive data outside the organization's boundaries. This works by defining policies that identify sensitive data and trigger actions when it's about to be exfiltrated.",
