  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: 'Pair students: One explains API Gateway authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT validation, OAuth 2.0 flows,
    mutual TLS) while the partner covers rate limiting strategies and input validation techniques. Switch roles, then discuss
    common misconceptions, such as assuming TLS alone provides full security without additional controls.'
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A fintech microservices app experiences DDoS attacks, SQL injection attempts, and unauthorized
    access. In groups, propose an API Gateway security architecture with specific configurations (e.g., rate limiting thresholds,
    WAF rules). Justify choices using OWASP guidelines and test your design against simulated attack vectors.'

    - 'Plausible but incorrect: Use common misconceptions (e.g., ''TLS encrypts data but doesn''t authenticate identities''
      as distractor for auth).'
    - 'Partial truths: Correct concept in wrong context (e.g., ''OAuth for authorization only'' vs. delegation).'
    - 'Edge cases: Overly simplistic or outdated (e.g., ''API keys alone suffice'' ignoring token theft).'
    - 'Confusions: Mix auth/authz, rate limiting/throttling.'
    - '3 distractors per MCQ: Balanced difficulty, 1 easy, 1 medium, 1 tricky.'
    avoid:
    - Obvious wrongs (e.g., 'API Gateway is a database')
    - Revealing correct answer in distractors
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in API Gateway Security Architecture\
  \ (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 006_API Security > 006_001_API Security Fundamentals > API\
  \ 005_Architecture and Design Patterns > API Gateway Security Architecture).\n\nGenerate 25 high-quality flashcards using\
  \ the provided structure. Base content on this optimized learning framework:\n\n**Prior Knowledge:** API fundamentals (REST),\
  \ microservices, authN/Z, TLS.\n\n**Learning Objectives (Bloom's Taxonomy):** [Insert the 6 objectives here verbatim].\n\
  \n**Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert scaffolding details verbatim, including layers 1-4].\n\n**Active Learning Context:** Use\
  \ for higher-order cards (e.g., analyze trade-offs from discussion, apply configs from problem-solving).\n\n**Content Sources:**\
  \ Core concepts (API Gateway as entry point, auth, rate limiting, etc.), Best Practices (TLS, OAuth/JWT, rate limiting token\
  \ bucket, input val, logging, WAF, OWASP API Top 10), Industry standards (OWASP).\n\n**Output Format:** JSON array of objects,\
  \ each matching this schema exactly:\n{\n  \"question\": \"...\",\n  \"answer\": \"...\",\n  \"options\": [\"Correct\",\
  \ \"Distractor1\", \"Distractor2\", \"Distractor3\"],\n  \"explanation\": \"...\",\n  \"bloom_level\": \"REMEMBER\",\n \
  \ \"scaffolding_layer\": 1,\n  \"tags\": [\"auth\", \"OWASP\"]\n}\n\n**Flashcard Rules:**\n- Cover all layers/objectives\
  \ proportionally (Layer1: basic recall; Layer4: design/eval).\n- Distractors: Follow protocol – plausible misconceptions\
  \ (e.g., JWT as auth only, no renewal).\n- Explanations: 2-4 sentences, reference OWASP/real-world, link to objectives.\n\
  - Varied types: 40% MCQ, 20% definition, 20% T/F, 20% cloze/application.\n- University pedagogy: Scaffolded, active recall,\
  \ spaced repetition friendly.\n\nEnsure flashcards promote deep understanding, not rote memorization. Output ONLY the JSON\
  \ array."
