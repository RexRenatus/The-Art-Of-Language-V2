active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare HMAC signatures versus asymmetric cryptography (e.g., EdDSA) for webhook security. Debate trade-offs
    in performance, key management, security against replay/spoofing attacks, and suitability for event-driven architectures.
    Address common misconceptions, such as assuming symmetric crypto is always simpler without considering scalability.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Base on common misconceptions (e.g., 'HMAC prevents eavesdropping' vs. actual integrity/authenticity)
    - 'Use plausible alternatives (e.g., for mitigations: ''HTTPS only'' instead of ''HMAC'' for spoofing)'
    - Incorporate partial truths (e.g., 'OAuth Bearer tokens are sufficient alone' ignoring replay risks)
    - Draw from research threats (e.g., distractor omitting timestamps for replay protection)
    - Ensure 1-2 highly plausible distractors per card to mimic exam difficulty
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Webhook Security Design

  Generate 50-60 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema. Cover all 4 scaffolding layers progressively (10-15 per
  layer). Distribute across Bloom''s levels: 20% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 30% APPLY/ANALYZE, 30% EVALUATE, 20% CREATE. Integrate
  active learning concepts (e.g., threats like spoofing/tampering/replay/DoS; mitigations: HMAC/EdDSA, idempotency, rate limiting;
  comparisons HMAC vs asymmetric).


  Incorporate:

  - Prior knowledge: HTTP/TLS, API basics.

  - Big picture: Event-driven architectures in app security.

  - Research: Definitions (webhooks as HTTP callbacks), threats (spoofing, tampering, replay, eavesdropping, DoS, secret leakage),
  best practices (signatures, validation, OAuth caveats).

  - Voter priorities: Measurable objectives, discussions (HMAC vs EdDSA), peer teaching (threats/mitigations), problem-solving
  (e-commerce webhook).


  Follow flashcard schema exactly:

  - Types: MCQ (4 opts, distractors per protocol), T/F, cloze, short answer.

  - Distractors: Misconceptions (e.g., HTTPS stops spoofing), partial truths.

  - Back: Answer + explanation (pedagogy links) + references.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards. Ensure active recall, no hints on front. Make explanations educational for university-level
  pedagogy.'
