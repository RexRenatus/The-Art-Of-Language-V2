active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether public API documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI) fully mitigates reconnaissance
    risks or if attackers can still uncover undocumented endpoints and hidden vulnerabilities. Use real-world examples from
    OWASP API Security Top 10 (e.g., Broken Object Level Authorization) to support your position and address common misconceptions
    like assuming documented APIs are inherently secure.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - D1: Common misconception (e.g., ''Public docs fully secure APIs'').

    - D2: Confuse passive/active techniques (e.g., fuzzing as passive).

    - D3: Tool misuse or outdated method (e.g., Nmap instead of ffuf for APIs).

    Ensure distractors are realistic, drawn from research context or voter notes (e.g., private API challenges). Balance coverage:
    40% Layer 1-2, 40% Layer 3, 20% Layer 4.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in API Security. Generate
  high-quality, pedagogically optimized flashcards for the topic ''API Reconnaissance Techniques'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > 008_Application Security > 006_API Security > 006_001_API Security Fundamentals > API Threat Landscape > API Reconnaissance
  Techniques).

  - Active Learning: [PASTE FULL DETAILS HERE]

  - Scaffolding: [PASTE FULL 4 LAYERS HERE]

  - Builds on prior knowledge: Web recon (directory busting, Nmap), HTTP fundamentals.

  - Research Context: API recon gathers endpoints, params, formats, auth, docs (passive: Swagger/JS; active: Burp/ffuf). Private
  APIs: Traffic intercept, reverse eng. Sources: OWASP API Top 10 (2023), PortSwigger labs.


  Use the exact Flashcard Schema provided. Ensure cards progress Bloom''s Taxonomy (Remember to Create) and scaffolding layers.
  Make explanations educational, correcting misconceptions (e.g., docs != security). Output ONLY the JSON array of flashcards,
  no additional text.'
