active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical and practical implications of a company delaying public disclosure
    of an API vulnerability beyond 90 days under their VDP. How does this balance user safety, researcher incentives, and
    business reputation? Reference real-world examples like Google or HackerOne VDPs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Topic Context (Full Synthesized Content):**

  **Title:** Vulnerability Disclosure Programs (VDPs)

  **Hierarchy:** Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 006_API Security > 009_014_API Testing and Vulnerability Assessment
  > 011_Vulnerability Management > Vulnerability Disclosure Programs

  **Prerequisites:** API Testing (vuln identification), Vulnerability Assessment (scanning tools).


  **Core Concepts:**

  - Vulnerability Disclosure: Reporting security weaknesses.

  - Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD): Responsible sharing between researcher/vendor before public release.

  - VDP: Formal program for intake/assessment/remediation.

  - VDP Policy: Rules for scope, handling, safe harbor (legal protection for good-faith reports).

  - Key Roles: VDPO (program office), FCB (federal coordination).

  - Reports: Source (researcher submission), Findings (org assessment).

  - Process: Intake > Triage (ack in 7 days, validate) > Remediation (fix) > Disclosure (coordinated, e.g., 90 days).


  **Best Practices and Guidelines (Completed):**

  - **Scope Definition:** Clearly list in-scope API endpoints/assets; out-of-scope (e.g., DoS).

  - **Safe Harbor:** No legal action for good-faith testing.

  - **Triage Process:** Acknowledge in 3-7 days, assess severity (CVSS), prioritize.

  - **Communication Timelines:** Initial response 7 days, fix/disclose 90-180 days.

  - **Rewards:** Hall of Fame, bounties (integrate with HackerOne).

  - **Researcher Guidelines:** Detailed report format (steps to repro, impact).

  - **Integration:** Link to vuln scanners, patch management.

  **Pedagogy Integration:** Use provided learning_objectives, active_learning, scaffolding, flashcard_schema. Ensure prior
  knowledge links, formative checks (e.g., ''Why link to API testing?'').


  **Task:** Generate 60 high-quality flashcards in JSON array format. Balance: 10 per Bloom''s level, across layers. Follow
  flashcard_schema exactly. Front: Engaging question. Back: Concise answer + 2-4 sentence explanation + metadata. Use distractors
  per protocol for MCQs. Focus on API context (e.g., API vulns like IDOR, injection). Output ONLY the JSON array of flashcards.'
