  peer_teaching: 'Pair students: Student A explains the NIST SP 800-40 patch lifecycle (Identify -> Prioritize -> Test ->
    Deploy -> Verify) with API examples (e.g., patching third-party libraries). Student B teaches it back via a 5-question
    quiz. Switch roles and discuss misconceptions like ''patching eliminates all risks''.'
  problem_solving: 'Team exercise: Given a scenario with 5 API-related CVEs (e.g., CVE-2023-XXXX in an API gateway), prioritize
    patches using CVSS scores, simulate testing/deployment in a virtual lab, assess post-deployment risks, and report on verification
    metrics. Link to vulnerability management remediation.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security Patch Management
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 006_API Security > 009_014_API Testing and Vulnerability Assessment
  > 011_Vulnerability Management > Level 6: Security Patch Management). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for
  spaced repetition and active recall, covering all Bloom''s levels and scaffolding layers evenly (aim: 10-15 per layer, spanning
  objectives).


  **Content Base:** Use this comprehensive summary (complete/incorporating voter/research inputs):

  - Definitions: Patch (software fix); Vulnerability (exploitable weakness); Exploit (leverage code); Patch Management (NIST:
  identify, prioritize, acquire/test, deploy, verify).

  - NIST SP 800-40 Rev. 4: Enterprise guide - steps: Inventory/Identify, Assess/Prioritize (CVSS), Test/Acquire, Deploy (phased),
  Verify/Monitor.

  - API Context: Patch gateways, libs (e.g., Log4j CVEs), OWASP links.

  - Standards: CIS Controls v8 #7 (Continuous Vuln Mgmt), ISO 27001 A.8.8.

  - Examples: WannaCry (unpatched SMB), Equifax (Struts). Tools: Scanners (Nessus), Automators (Ansible).

  - Concept Map: Central ''Patch Mgmt Process'' -> Identify->Prioritize->Test->Deploy->Verify; Links: Vuln/Exploit, API Sec.


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Scaffolding: [insert full scaffolding details above] - Tag each card.

  - Active Learning: Inspire questions from discussions (trade-offs), peer-teach (steps), problem-solving (prioritize CVEs).


  **Generation Rules:**

  - 70% MCQ (4 options), 20% Short Answer/Cloze, 10% T/F.

  - Follow exact schema: [insert full flashcard_schema.structure above].

  - Distractors: [insert distractor_protocol].

  - Explanations: [insert explanation_requirements].

  - Balance: 1/6 per Bloom''s; API/vuln links; Voter priorities (completeness, pedagogy).

  - Output: JSON array of 50 flashcards. No extra text.'
