active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using OSS in API development (e.g., speed vs. risks like
    supply chain attacks). How does SCA enable 'shift-left' security, and what policy changes would you propose for your team?
    Support with examples like Log4Shell.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    analysis), 2) Proprietary code focus, 3) Hardware/network irrelevancies, 4) Incomplete risks (e.g., ignore transitive
    deps). Ensure plausible but incorrect (e.g., SCA analyzes ''proprietary code'' vs. correct ''OSS/third-party'').'

  **Content Base:** SCA identifies/manages OSS/third-party risks (70-90% of apps; avg 147 components). Key concepts: OSS,
  dependencies (direct/transitive), SBOM. Process: Scan codebase → Identify deps → Check CVEs/licenses → Generate SBOM → Remediate.
  OSS Risks (complete): Vulnerabilities (CVEs e.g., Log4Shell), license compliance, outdated components, supply chain attacks,
  lack of support, operational risks (abandoned projects). Sources: splunk.com, checkmarx.com, fossa.com.


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the exact learning_objectives array above].

  - Scaffolding: Use 4 layers [Insert scaffolding_layers]. Balance flashcards across layers.

  - Active Learning: Tie 20% of cards to activities [Insert active_learning].


  **Generation Rules:**

  - Create 40 flashcards using schema [Insert flashcard_schema].

  - Cover voter priorities: Completeness (full risks), pedagogy (Bloom''s, assessments), scaffolding (implementation steps),
  active learning.

  - MCQs: 4 options, distractors per protocol.

  - Ensure university-style: Active recall, spaced repetition friendly, explanations scaffold understanding.

  - Output ONLY in JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'':
  ''...'', ''source'': ''...'', ''layer'': 1, ''tie'': ''optional''}}]. No extra text.'
