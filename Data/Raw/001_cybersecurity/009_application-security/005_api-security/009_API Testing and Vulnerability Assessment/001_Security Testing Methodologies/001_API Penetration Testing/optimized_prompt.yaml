active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare the security testing challenges of REST vs. GraphQL APIs. Using real-world examples like the
    2021 Facebook GraphQL breach, debate which is more prone to Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) and why. Consider
    factors like query flexibility, object-level permissions, and enumeration risks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    with session-based auth); (2) Partial truths (e.g., mix up BOLA with IDOR); (3) Edge cases or outdated info (e.g., pre-OWASP
    API Top 10 terms); (4) Real-world distractors from breaches (e.g., wrong vuln for Facebook case). Ensure distractors are
    realistic to challenge understanding without being obvious.'

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM learning_objectives]

  - Active Learning: Use discussion prompts, peer teaching, and problem-solving exercises to inspire analytical cards (e.g.,
  scenario-based questions referencing OWASP Juice Shop or Facebook breach).

  - Scaffolding: Generate flashcards strictly layered: [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING DESCRIPTION]. Distribute cards evenly across
  4 layers.

  - Prior Knowledge: Assume basics in HTTP, web app pen testing; reinforce links.

  - Content Sources: OWASP API Security Top 10 (full: BOLA, Broken User Auth, Excessive Data Exposure, etc.), OWASP WSTG (API
  testing checklists: recon, auth, input validation), tools (Burp Suite, Postman, ZAP), case studies (2021 Facebook GraphQL
  breach), API types (REST, GraphQL, SOAP).


  Follow this Flashcard Schema exactly: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD_SCHEMA].


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, e.g., [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'':
  1, ''tags'': [''OWASP API Top 10'']}, ...]. Ensure variety, high quality, and alignment with university pedagogy (Bloom''s
  progression, active recall). Generate 200+ total cards for comprehensive coverage.'
