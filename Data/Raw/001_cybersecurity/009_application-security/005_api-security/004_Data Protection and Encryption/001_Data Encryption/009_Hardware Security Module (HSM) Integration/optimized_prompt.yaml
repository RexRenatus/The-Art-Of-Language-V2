  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s Taxonomy - cover all evenly):**

  {insert learning_objectives array here}


  **Active Learning Integration:** Ensure flashcards prompt critical thinking (e.g., ''Why evaluate this for PCI?''). Tie
  to: {insert active_learning summary}.

  **Research Context:** Base all content on this summary (complete truncated sections): HSM: tamper-resistant device for key
  gen/storage/ops (never expose plaintext), Root of Trust. Standards: FIPS 140-2 (tamper resistance, Level 3+); FIPS 140-3
  (updated, modular, enhanced testing). Compliance: PCI DSS (card data encryption); GDPR (secure personal data encryption/pseudonymization
  via key mgmt); HIPAA (PHI protection). Best practices: Client setup (PKCS#11), TLS, audits. Sources: NIST SP 800-140 (FIPS),
  PCI SSC docs, GDPR Art. 32, HIPAA Security Rule.
