  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Poor key management causes 80% of cryptography failures
    in breaches like Equifax or SolarWinds.'' Use NIST SP 800-57 to support arguments on why key rotation and secure storage
    are critical in API security, and propose one improvement for each example.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    don''t need secure distribution''), (2) Partial truths (e.g., mix symmetric/asymmetric roles), (3) Real-world failure
    examples (e.g., ''Hardcode keys for simplicity''). Ensure distractors are realistic from breaches like Equifax. Explanation
    must justify correct answer and debunk each distractor.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Encryption 006_Key Management''
  (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 006_API Security > 004_Data Protection and Encryption > Data Encryption
  > Key Management). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning components, scaffolding layers (4 layers), and
  flashcard schema. Incorporate NIST SP 800-57 (Parts 1-3 fully: lifecycle stages - generation/distribution/storage/use/rotation/revocation/destruction/archiving;
  key types; security services), prior knowledge links to data encryption basics, real-world breaches (SolarWinds, Equifax,
  Code Spaces), big picture (prevents 80% crypto failures in API sec), and concept map.


  Generate 40 high-quality flashcards (10 per scaffolding layer) spanning all Bloom''s levels (at least 1-2 per level per
  layer). Prioritize active learning ties. Output as JSON array of objects matching the flashcard schema exactly. Ensure MCQs
  have 3 distractors with protocol. Questions must be optimized for spaced repetition: specific, testable, with scaffolding
  progression. No duplicates; vary formats (cloze, MCQ, short answer, scenario).'
