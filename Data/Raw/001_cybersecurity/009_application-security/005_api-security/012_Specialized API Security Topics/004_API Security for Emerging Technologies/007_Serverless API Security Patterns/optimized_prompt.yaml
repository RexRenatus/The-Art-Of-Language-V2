active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs of using public vs. private APIs in serverless setups—when would you choose each,
    and what risks do they mitigate? Consider factors like scalability, compliance, and attack surface.
  peer_teaching: 'Teach-back: In pairs, explain one key risk (e.g., over-permissioned functions or unvalidated inputs) and
    its pattern-based mitigation (e.g., least-privilege IAM or JSON Schema validation) to each other, then switch roles.'
  problem_solving: Design a secure serverless API for a real-world e-commerce backend using AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Address
    unvalidated inputs, function chaining, and secrets management. Present your architecture and justify choices.

    rules:
    - Generate 2-3 distractors per MCQ that are plausible but incorrect, based on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Serverless
      means no IAM needed' for over-permissioned risks).
    - 'Use partial truths (e.g., correct pattern but wrong context: ''Use *:* IAM for simplicity'').'
    - Draw from real-world errors in sources like OWASP Serverless Top 10 or AWS docs.
    - Ensure distractors test nuance (e.g., public vs. private API trade-offs).
    variety: Mix 40% basic recall, 30% application/analysis MCQs, 30% scenario-based for higher Bloom's.

  \ Patterns' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 006_API Security > Specialized 006_API Security Topics\
  \ > 006_API Security for Emerging Technologies > Serverless 006_API Security Patterns).\n\n**Content Summary (Complete &\
  \ Enhanced per Voter Consensus):**\n- **Core Concepts:** Serverless/FaaS (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions),\
  \ API Gateway (routing/auth/rate limiting), Private APIs (VPC-only), Private Integration (non-public backend).\n- **Key\
  \ Risks:** Over-permissioned Functions (broad IAM), Unvalidated Event Inputs (injection), Hardcoded Secrets (keys in code),\
  \ Function Chaining (lateral movement).\n- **Security Patterns:** Least-Privilege IAM, Input Validation (JSON Schemas/API\
  \ models), Secret Management (SSM/Secrets Manager), Rate Limiting/Token Validation (JWT/Cognito), Mutual TLS, WAF Integration,\
  \ Observability (CloudWatch).\n- **Industry Standards:** OWASP Serverless Top 10 (S1-S10), AWS Well-Architected Security\
  \ Pillar, Microsoft Azure Well-Architected (Identity/Security), Google Cloud Best Practices (Binary Authorization, VPC Service\
  \ Controls).\n- **Sources:** OWASP.org/serverless-top-10, docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/security, docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security,\
