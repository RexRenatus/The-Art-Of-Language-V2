active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of 5G networks, how does network slicing impact API security? Debate the trade-offs between
    flexibility for services (e.g., eMBB, URLLC, mMTC) and increased attack surface, using NIST principles and 3GPP standards
    as references. Consider real-world implications for a smart city deployment.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors from: 1) Common misconceptions (slicing=VLANs, 5G=4G+speed); 2) Partial truths
    (e.g., TLS but wrong version); 3) Irrelevant analogies (4G threats); 4) Overgeneralizations (all APIs same security).
    Ensure distractors teach by contrast.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in 5G Network API Security
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 006_API Security > Specialized 006_API Security Topics > 006_API
  Security for Emerging Technologies > 5G Network 006_API Security). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning
  activities, scaffolding layers (including prior knowledge), and flashcard schema to create high-quality, pedagogically optimized
  flashcards.


  Incorporate university-style pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy progression, active learning hooks (reference discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving
  where relevant), scaffolding from foundation to integration, and web-grounded context (5G SBA, NF APIs, NRF, slicing, edge,
  NIST/3GPP/GSMA/OWASP, threats like API abuse/URLLC).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each matching the exact schema structure (MCQ, Short Answer, or Scenario-Based).
  Ensure 20-30 total, balanced as per schema rules. Distractors must follow the protocol. Every flashcard includes bloom_level,
  scaffolding_layer, and explanation tying to objectives/research.


  Prioritize misconceptions, real-world 5G examples (smart city, URLLC), and measurable mastery.'
