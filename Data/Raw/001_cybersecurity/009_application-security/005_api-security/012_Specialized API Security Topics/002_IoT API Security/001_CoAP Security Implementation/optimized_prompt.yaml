active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using OSCORE versus DTLS for securing CoAP in battery-constrained
    IoT networks. Consider factors like message overhead, end-to-end protection through proxies, and implementation complexity.
    Support arguments with references to RFC 8613 and real-world IoT constraints.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Research Context (Complete Summary):**

  CoAP (RFC 7252): RESTful protocol for IoT constrained devices/networks, UDP-based like HTTP but lightweight.

  OSCORE (RFC 8613): Application-layer end-to-end security for CoAP using COSE (RFC 8152) for AEAD encryption (e.g., AES-CCM),
  integrity, replay protection via sequence numbers. Protects entire CoAP message object, proxy-friendly.

  ACE (RFC 9200/9203): OAuth 2.0-based authz framework for constrained envs, with PoP (RFC 9201) to bind keys to tokens.

  CoAP-EAP (RFC 9820): Extends EAP (RFC 3748) over CoAP for IP-less authentication of IoT devices, facilitating mutual auth
  and key derivation (e.g., via TLS-EAP).

  Other: Security Context (shared keys/IDs), DTLS (RFC 9147) for transport security.

  Sources: RFC 7252, 8152, 8613, 9200-9203, 9820; libs: aiocoap, Californium.


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Use provided Learning Objectives (Bloom''s: REMEMBER to CREATE), Active Learning activities, 4-Layer
  Scaffolding, and Prior Knowledge. Ensure flashcards scaffold from Layer 1 to 4.


  **Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following the Flashcard Schema:**

  - Vary types: 8 Cloze, 10 MCQ (4 opts, 1 correct), 7 Short Answer.

  - Tie to objectives: e.g., APPLY cards use implementation steps.

  - Include concept map elements (e.g., ''Link OSCORE to COSE'').

  - Distractors per protocol.

  - Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''distractors'': [...], ''hints'': ''...'', ''reference'': ''...''}}, ...]


  Prioritize measurable, active recall for university-level pedagogy.'
