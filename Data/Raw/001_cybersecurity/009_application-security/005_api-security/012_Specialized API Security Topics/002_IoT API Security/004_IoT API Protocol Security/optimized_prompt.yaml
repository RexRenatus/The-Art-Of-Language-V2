active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between security (e.g., strong TLS enforcement) and performance
    (e.g., lightweight CoAP/DTLS) in resource-constrained IoT devices. Use real-world examples like smart home hacks to support
    arguments and propose hybrid solutions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    controls). Ensure distractors are 70-80% plausible to challenge learners without frustrating.'

  **Completed Research Context (Web-Grounded, Voter-Enhanced):**

  IoT API Protocol Security focuses on securing APIs in IoT ecosystems. Key protocols: MQTT (pub/sub, secures via TLS/SSL,
  ACLs, SASL in v5.0), CoAP (constrained HTTP-like over UDP, DTLS/OSCORE), HTTP/REST (TLS, OAuth/JWT). Threats: OWASP API
  Top 10 (Broken Object Level Auth, Excessive Data Exposure, Injection; IoT examples: Mirai botnet via weak MQTT creds, smart
  lock hacks). Standards: OWASP IoT Security Verification Standard (ISVS) - checklist for firmware, APIs; Connectivity Standards
  Alliance (CSA) Matter protocol (unifies smart home: IPv6, device attestation, rotating keys, Thread/Wi-Fi/Bluetooth secure
  pairing). NIST IR 8259 series. Best practices: Zero-trust, rate limiting, input validation.
