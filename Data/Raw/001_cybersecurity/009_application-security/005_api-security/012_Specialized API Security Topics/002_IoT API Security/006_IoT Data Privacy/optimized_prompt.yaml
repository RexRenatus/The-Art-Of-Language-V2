active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a world where convenience drives IoT adoption, should governments mandate end-to-end encryption for
    all IoT data transmissions? Argue pro and con, balancing privacy benefits against increased device costs, battery drain,
    and potential availability issues under the CIA Triad.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ from common misconceptions (e.g., 'IoT devices are inherently secure' → distractor
      ignoring weak defaults).
    - Base on research context/challenges (e.g., confuse Confidentiality with Integrity).
    - 'Ensure plausibility: Use partial truths or edge cases (e.g., ''Mandatory encryption increases costs but not battery
      drain'' as distractor).'
    - Avoid obvious wrongs; test for Bloom's progression (recall distractors for remember cards, nuanced for analyze).
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy.
  Topic: IoT Data Privacy (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 006_API Security > Specialized 006_API Security
