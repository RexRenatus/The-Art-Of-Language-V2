active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the security trade-offs of GraphQL's partial response error handling (data
    + errors) compared to REST's full failure responses. How does this impact information leakage risks, and what mitigations
    align with OWASP Top 10 (A6-Sensitive Data Exposure)? Support with examples from the GraphQL spec.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors: 1 common misconception (e.g., confuse with REST HTTP codes), 1 edge case mix-up (e.g.,
      path vs locations), 1 security red herring (e.g., overly verbose option).'
    - Ensure distractors are realistic from research/voter context (e.g., 'stacktrace' as distractor for extensions).
    - 'Balance difficulty: 50% Layer 1-2 (recall/understand), 30% Layer 3 (apply/analyze), 20% Layer 4 (evaluate/create).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in GraphQL Error Message Handling
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 006_API Security > Specialized 006_API Security Topics > GraphQL
  Security > GraphQL Error Message Handling). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities, 4-layer scaffolding,
  and flashcard schema to create optimized Anki-style flashcards.


  **Core Content (Integrate Fully, Completing Voter Consensus):** GraphQL errors in ''errors'' array (200 OK always); structure:
  message (sanitized), locations, path, extensions (codes like ''AUTH_FAIL''). Types: Parse/validation vs execution. Security:
  Prevent leakage (verbose msgs expose stacks/paths/DBs) via generic prod msgs, server logging, extensions codes, no internals
  client-side. Best practices: Custom classes, validate extensions. Big picture: OWASP A6 mitigation. Sources: GraphQL Spec,
  OWASP GraphQL Cheat Sheet.


  **Pedagogy:** Align to Bloom''s objectives. Scaffold progressively. Inspire active learning (e.g., flashcards prompt discussion/analysis).


  **Output Exactly:** JSON array of 50 flashcards per schema. No extras.'
