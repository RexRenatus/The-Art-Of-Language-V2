active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between runtime static analysis (e.g., using graphql-cost-analysis)
    and trusted documents for production GraphQL APIs. Consider scenarios like high-traffic e-commerce sites vulnerable to
    DoS via deeply nested queries. What factors (performance, security, developer experience) should prioritize one over the
    other?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    1. Common misconception (e.g., confuse static analysis with execution-time).

    2. Edge case reversal (e.g., swap depth/breadth effects).

    3. Plausible but incorrect value/library (e.g., wrong cost calc or npm package).

    Ensure distractors are realistic from voter/research context (e.g., outdated DoS defs, missing integration).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in GraphQL Query Complexity
  Analysis (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > 006_API Security > Specialized 006_API Security Topics
  > GraphQL Security > GraphQL Query Complexity Analysis). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities,
  4-layer scaffolding, voter consensus (84.3% approval emphasizing pedagogy/completeness), and research context (definitions:
  operation complexity, static analysis, cost estimation, DoS, trusted documents; libraries: graphql-cost-analysis, graphql-depth-limit;
  standards: OWASP GraphQL Cheat Sheet, GraphQL Foundation).


  Prioritize university pedagogy: Bloom''s progression, active learning hooks (e.g., reference discussion scenarios in explanations),
  scaffolding (content from specific layers).


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards following this exact schema:

  [Insert full ''flashcard_schema'' structure here].


  Incorporate: Malicious query examples (deep nesting), calculations (sample costs), concept map dependencies, prior knowledge
  links, completed standards/sources. Ensure cards scaffold from Layer 1 foundations to Layer 4 integration. Output ONLY a
  JSON array of flashcard objects, no additional text.'
