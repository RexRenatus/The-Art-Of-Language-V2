active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between security and performance when choosing authentication
    methods for AWS API Gateway (e.g., Lambda custom authorizers vs. IAM sigv4). Consider scenarios like high-traffic APIs
    and justify your preferred approach with pros/cons.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs (4 options total).
    - 'Base on: Common misconceptions (e.g., confuse IAM with API keys), partial truths (e.g., ''WAF only for web apps'' vs.
      API support), outdated practices (e.g., TLS 1.0), or over-generalizations (e.g., ''Always use public endpoints'').'
    - Ensure one distractor is a frequent misconfig (e.g., 'Disable logging to save costs').
    - Mark correct answer clearly (e.g., **A**).
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for university-level cybersecurity education on ''AWS API Gateway Security''.
  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet, covering the full topic hierarchy and voter consensus on
  completeness (e.g., full best practices: IAM/resource policies, Cognito/Lambda authorizers, throttling/usage plans, WAF,
  TLS encryption, CloudWatch logging).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: Ensure coverage across all 6 provided objectives (tag each card).

  - Active Learning: Include 5 cards as ''Activity Prompts'' mirroring discussion/peer/problem-solving.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards: 15 Layer 1, 15 Layer 2, 10 Layer 3, 10 Layer 4.

  - Bloom''s Progression: Mix levels for spaced repetition.
