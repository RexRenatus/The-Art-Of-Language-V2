  discussion_prompt: 'In a high-stakes e-commerce environment during peak sales, your WAF starts blocking legitimate orders
    due to false positives from encoded parameters. Debate the trade-offs: Should you loosen rules risking false negatives,
    or maintain strict security at the cost of revenue? Support with OWASP rule examples and real-world metrics.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    whitelisting risks); 4) Real-world pitfalls (over-tuning leads to FNs). Ensure plausible but incorrect, grounded in research.'

  Generate a set of 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for spaced repetition and Bloom''s Taxonomy. Integrate:

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste the full list above].

  - Active Learning: Inspire cards from discussion (trade-offs), peer teaching (best practices), problem-solving (log analysis).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards: 25% Layer 1 (definitions), 25% Layer 2 (components), 25% Layer 3 (steps/best practices:
  monitoring mode, log analysis, tuning, whitelisting, SIEM), 25% Layer 4 (ML, OWASP CRS, integrations). Include prior knowledge/misconceptions.

  - Research Context: WAF at OSI L7 blocks SQLi/XSS; FPs from aggressive rules; Best Practices: 1) Monitoring mode, 2) Log
  analysis (Splunk), 3) Rule tuning/thresholds, 4) Whitelisting/exceptions, 5) SIEM integration, 6) ML auto-tuning, 7) Feedback
  loops, 8) Canary testing. Sources: OWASP.org, Cloudflare Developers, Prophaze, Radware.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: Anki JSON array [{''Front'':..., ''Back'':..., ''Tags'':[...], ''Type'':...}]. Ensure university
  pedagogy: active recall, scaffolding progression, distractors from misconceptions. Vary formats for engagement. Output ONLY
  the JSON array of flashcards.'
