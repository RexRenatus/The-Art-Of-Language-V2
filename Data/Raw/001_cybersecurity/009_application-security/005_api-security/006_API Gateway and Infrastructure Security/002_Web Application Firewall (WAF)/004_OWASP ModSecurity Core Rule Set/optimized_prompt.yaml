    Confuse WAF with TLS encryption; CRS as logging tool vs detection; limited to Top 10 only; auth tool vs attack detection;

  **Context and Research Summary:** OWASP CRS is a set of generic attack detection rules for WAF engines like ModSecurity/Coraza,
  protecting against OWASP Top 10 (e.g., Injection, XSS) in defense-in-depth for APIs. Key terms: WAF (filters HTTP), ModSecurity
  (engine), false positives (legit blocked), false negatives (missed attacks). Installation: Verify GPG from GitHub (https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset),
  configure SecRuleEngine On, tune paranoia levels. Sources: OWASP CRS GitHub, official docs (https://coreruleset.org/), OWASP
  Top 10.

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]

  - Scaffolding: Generate flashcards balanced across 4 layers: [INSERT FULL scaffolding OBJECT HERE]

  - Active Learning Tie-in: Cards should prompt recall for discussions (e.g., trade-offs), peer quizzes (install steps), problem-solving
  (scenarios).

  - Prior Knowledge: Assume basics in HTTP, Apache/Nginx, WAF, Top 10.

  - Voter Consensus: 100% approval; emphasize Bloom''s progression, false positive tuning, install completeness, concept map.


  **Generation Instructions:** Create 25 high-quality flashcards using EXACT flashcard_schema. Cover all objectives/layers.
  Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''MCQ'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''1'', ''bloom'': ''Remember'',
  ''explanation'': ''...''}]. Ensure spaced repetition friendly: concise fronts, detailed backs. No duplicates. Use voter
  MCQ examples (e.g., CRS primary function: B) Generic attack detection).'
