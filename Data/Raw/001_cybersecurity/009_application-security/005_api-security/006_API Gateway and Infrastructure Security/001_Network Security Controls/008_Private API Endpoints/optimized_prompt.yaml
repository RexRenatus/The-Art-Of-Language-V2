active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the security trade-offs of private API endpoints versus public APIs with strong authentication
    (e.g., mutual TLS) in a hybrid cloud environment. What are the risks (e.g., lateral movement in VPC) and benefits (e.g.,
    reduced public exposure)? Support with AWS Shared Responsibility Model examples.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains 'private API endpoints' vs. 'private integrations' using hand-drawn diagrams
    (e.g., VPC Link to NLB). Include VPC isolation and access via Direct Connect/VPN. Switch roles and provide feedback on
    clarity.
  problem_solving: In groups of 3-4, design and critique an AWS architecture using private API endpoints for an internal e-commerce
    inventory service. Address OWASP API risks (e.g., BOLA, excessive data exposure), incorporate VPC endpoints, IAM policies,
    and CloudWatch monitoring. Present and peer-review for Well-Architected alignment.

    publicly with auth'' vs. VPC-only); 2) Confusions (private API vs. VPC Endpoint, public API, private integration); 3)
    Edge cases (hybrid cloud access without VPN); 4) Partial truths (e.g., ''NLB only for REST APIs'' – actually supports
    HTTP too). Ensure distractors are realistic per AWS docs and OWASP.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in AWS API Security. Generate
  30 high-quality MCQ flashcards on ''Private API Endpoints'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security >
  006_API Security > 006_API Gateway and Infrastructure Security > 004_003_Network Security Controls > Private API Endpoints).
  Ensure even coverage: 5 per Bloom''s level from learning_objectives, 7-8 per scaffolding_layer.


  Incorporate research context: Private APIs restrict access to VPC via IAM resource policies; use VPC Links for private integrations
  (NLB/ALB); Shared Responsibility Model (AWS: cloud security; Customer: VPC/IAM configs); Well-Architected Security Pillar;
  OWASP API Top 10 mitigation. Sources: AWS Docs (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-private-api.html,
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints.html), Shared Resp (https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/),
  Well-Arch (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/welcome.html).


  Use exact flashcard_schema for each: MCQ with question, options (A-D), correct_answer (letter + why), distractors (3 explanations),
  explanation (detailed, layer/source/remediation), bloom_level, scaffolding_layer, source.


  Prioritize active learning tie-ins: Questions on trade-offs (discussion), comparisons (peer teaching), architectures (problem-solving).
  Make explanations formative: Include ''Why wrong?'' feedback and self-assessment prompts (e.g., ''Reflect: How does this
  apply to your prior VPC knowledge?''). Output as JSON array of objects.'
