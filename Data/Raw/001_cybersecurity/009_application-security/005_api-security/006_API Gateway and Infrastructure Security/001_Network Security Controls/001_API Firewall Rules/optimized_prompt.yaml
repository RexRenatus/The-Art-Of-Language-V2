active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare NIST SP 800-228 and OWASP API Security Top 10 for prioritizing API Firewall Rules in a cloud-native
    e-commerce API. Which risks would you block first (e.g., broken authentication vs. injection) and why? Support your prioritization
    with examples from the API lifecycle.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list from JSON]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert full scaffolding from JSON] – Distribute flashcards evenly (5 per layer).

  - Active Learning: Draw from discussion/activities for contextual questions.

  - Research Context: NIST SP 800-228 (API protection in cloud-native systems: risk ID/analysis), NIST CSF Protect function,
  OWASP API Top 10, examples (rate limiting, input validation), API lifecycle security.
