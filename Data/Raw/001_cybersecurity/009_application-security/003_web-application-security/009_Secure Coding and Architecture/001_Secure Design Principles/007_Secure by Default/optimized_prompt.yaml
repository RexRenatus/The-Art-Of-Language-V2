active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss how 'Secure by Default' principles could have mitigated real-world incidents like the Equifax
    breach (due to insecure defaults). Connect this to prior knowledge of threat modeling, SDLC phases, and related concepts
    like input validation. What challenges arise in implementation?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    ever''); 2) Related but wrong concepts (e.g., mix with Zero Trust); 3) Real-world non-examples (e.g., Equifax defaults);
    4) Partial truths (e.g., ''Only for web apps''). Ensure 70% plausibility to promote critical thinking.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Secure by Default'' (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Web 008_Application Security > 002_Secure Coding and Architecture
  > Secure Design Principles > Secure by Default). Use the provided research context, learning objectives, active learning
  components, scaffolding layers, and flashcard schema to generate 25 high-quality flashcards.


  **Research Context:** ''Secure by Default'' mandates software resilient out-of-the-box without user config. Core: Defaults
  most secure, shift burden to manufacturers. Vs. ''Vulnerable by Design'' (inherent risks). Part of ''Security-by-Design''
  (SDLC-wide). Sources: OWASP (https://devguide.owasp.org/en/04-design/02-web-app-checklist/01-secure-by-default/), CISA (https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-06/principles_approaches_for_security-by-design-default_508c.pdf),
  NIST SP 800-218 SSDF (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-218.pdf). Examples: SSH no password
  auth, web no directory listing. Real-world: Equifax insecure defaults.


  **Incorporate:**

  - Learning objectives (span Bloom''s: REMEMBER to CREATE).

  - Scaffolding (distribute across 4 layers).

  - Active learning (tie flashcards to prompts/exercises).

  - Ensure progression: Foundation → Components → Implementation → Integration.

  - Concept map in relevant cards.


  **Output Format:** JSON array of objects: [{''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''1-4'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'':
  {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'', ''opt3''], ''source'': ''...'', ''active_tie_in'':
  ''...''}}, ...]. Strictly follow schema; no extras.'
