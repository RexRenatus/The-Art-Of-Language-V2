  discussion_prompt: 'In a group of 4, debate the trade-offs of ''shifting security left'' in CSI: Does it slow down development
    velocity or prevent costly breaches? Use real-world examples from NIST SP 800-204D or OWASP Top 10 CI/CD (e.g., insufficient
    credential hygiene) to support arguments, and vote on a consensus recommendation.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse CSI with traditional security
      testing; mix up NIST/CIS/OWASP roles).
    - 'Distractor 1: Semantic similarity (near-synonym wrong term).'
    - 'Distractor 2: Common error (e.g., ''Security at end of pipeline'' vs. shift-left).'
    - 'Distractor 3: Partial truth (e.g., tool name but wrong use case).'
    - Ensure 20% basic recall, 30% understand/apply, 30% analyze/evaluate, 20% create/open-ended.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate a deck of 50 high-quality flashcards
  on ''Continuous Security Integration'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Web 008_Application
  Security > 002_Secure Coding and Architecture > Secure Development Lifecycle > Continuous Security Integration). Base content
  on provided research: Core concepts (DevSecOps, CI/CD, SSC, artifacts, maturity); Frameworks (NIST SP 800-204D: SSC in pipelines;
  CIS Controls; OWASP SPVS tiers; OWASP Top 10 CI/CD: risks like credential issues, untrusted code, tampered artifacts—mitigate
  with scanning/signing); Tools (SonarQube SAST, Dependabot SCA, Cosign); Voter priorities (82.9% consensus).


  Incorporate pedagogy:

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste the 6 objectives here].

  - Scaffolding: Balance cards across 4 layers [Paste scaffolding descriptions].

  - Active Learning: Tie explanations to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving [Paste active learning].

  - Prior Knowledge: Assume CI/CD basics; anchor to DevSecOps.


  Use Flashcard Schema exactly:

  - Front: MCQ (4 options) or short-answer.

  - Back: **Correct Answer**, Explanation (pedagogical link), Bloom Level, Layer, References.

  - Distractors: 3 plausible per MCQ per protocol [Paste distractor rules].
