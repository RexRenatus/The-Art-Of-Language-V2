active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate Google AIP-185 (URI path major versioning without minor/patch exposure) versus traditional Semantic
    Versioning for a high-security API like a financial service. Which risks more vulnerabilities during transitions (e.g.,
    downgrade attacks), and why? Debate in groups, citing pros/cons and security implications.
  peer_teaching: 'Teach-back activity: Partner A explains backward compatibility with a concrete example (e.g., adding optional
    MFA field without breaking v1 clients); Partner B rephrases, critiques for security gaps (e.g., incomplete deprecation
    leading to version confusion), and switches roles.'
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: Evolve a user authentication API by adding MFA (breaking change). Design a v2 rollout plan using
    a hybrid strategy (URI + header), simulate client migration, assess risks like downgrade attacks or caching issues, and
    propose mitigations. Groups present and peer-review plans.'

    non-breaking changes (adding optional fields); 2) Misattributing pros/cons (e.g., query param as cache-friendly when it''s
    not); 3) Overlooking security (e.g., header versioning immune to downgrade attacks); 4) Google AIP-185 errors (exposing
    minor versions); 5) Incomplete strategies (omitting hybrid/channel-based). Ensure plausible and educational.'

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (balanced: 40% MCQ, 30% short_answer, 30% cloze) covering all learning objectives (REMEMBER
  to CREATE), active learning activities, and 4 scaffolding layers. Ensure coverage: 20% Layer 1 (foundations/terms), 25%
  Layer 2 (strategies/pros-cons/Google AIP-185), 25% Layer 3 (implementation/steps), 30% Layer 4 (integration/security/deprecation).
  Include security focus: version confusion, downgrade attacks, patch rollouts.


  Complete content knowledge:

  - Strategies: 1) URI (/v1/resource): Pros (simple, cacheable), Cons (endpoint proliferation), Security (clear separation).
  2) Header (Accept: app/vnd.v2+json): Pros (clean URLs), Cons (debug hard), Security (negotiation risks). 3) Query (?version=2):
  Pros (single endpoint), Cons (cache/SEO issues), Security (param tampering). 4) Channel-based (client-specific channels):
  Pros (isolated), Cons (complex mgmt), Security (reduced confusion). 5) Media type/hybrid. Pros/cons table implied.

  - Google AIP-185: Major v1 in URI/protobuf, no minor/patch exposed.

  - Sources: Google API Design Standards (AIP-185: https://google.aip.dev/185), Microsoft REST API Guidelines, REST Best Practices.


  Use exact flashcard schema: {id, type, question, answer, distractors (array for MCQ), explanation, bloom_level, scaffolding_layer,
