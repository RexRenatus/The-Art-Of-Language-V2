active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss how DFDs differ from network diagrams and why they are superior for proactive threat modeling
    in web applications. Provide examples of how DFDs reveal data-related vulnerabilities that topology diagrams miss, referencing
    NIST SP 800-53 or OWASP.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    1. Common misconception (e.g., confuse DFD processes with network nodes).

    2. Partial truth/exaggeration (e.g., ''DFDs show physical topology'' vs. data flow).

    3. Related but irrelevant concept (e.g., mix with ERDs or UML). Ensure plausible based on web research (e.g., bluegoatcyber.com
    confusions between flows/stores). Distractors test nuance in threat modeling/web sec.'

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy progression, active learning integration,
  4-layer scaffolding (Foundation: basics; Components: structure; Implementation: steps/examples; Integration: threat modeling/standards),
  voter consensus (completeness on NIST/OWASP/CMMC/STRIDE, examples, big picture in secure lifecycle).


  Incorporate research: DFDs visualize data flows (processes transform data; flows move it; stores hold it; entities source/dest
  it). Key for proactive risks, incident response, compliance. Standards: NIST SP 800-53 (access controls), OWASP (web sec),
  CMMC (CUI), Microsoft Tool, STRIDE on DFDs.
