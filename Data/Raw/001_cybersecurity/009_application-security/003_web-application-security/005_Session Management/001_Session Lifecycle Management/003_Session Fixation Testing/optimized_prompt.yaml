active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the relative risks of session fixation compared to XSS-enabled session
    hijacking. Provide real-world examples (e.g., from OWASP Juice Shop) and propose how session lifecycle management from
    prior modules (005_Session Management) could prevent it. Synthesize group consensus into a shared mitigation checklist.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truth (e.g., correct for another vuln like CSRF); 3) Extreme/edge case (e.g., irrelevant tool or step). Ensure
    distractors are realistic from research context (e.g., URL vs. cookie methods).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Session Fixation Testing
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Web 008_Application Security > 005_Session Management > Session
  Lifecycle Management > Session Fixation Testing). Use the provided learning objectives (Bloom''s Taxonomy), active learning
  activities, 4-layer scaffolding, research context (session fixation: attacker fixes known SID pre-auth, no regen post-login;
  vectors: URL/hidden forms; tools: Burp Suite; standards: OWASP ASVS/NIST), and voter priorities (hands-on Burp/Juice Shop
  labs, step-by-step testing, prevention integration).


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following the exact schema: Mix Basic, Cloze, Multiple Choice. For MCQs, apply distractor
  protocol strictly. Every card must reference scaffolding layer, Bloom''s level, a testing step/tool, and mitigation. Ensure
  university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition optimized (concise fronts, explanatory backs).


  Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''Multiple Choice'', ''front'': ''...'', ''options'': [''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D''], ''correct'':
  ''A'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''Apply'', ''layer'': 3}, ...]. No extra text.'
