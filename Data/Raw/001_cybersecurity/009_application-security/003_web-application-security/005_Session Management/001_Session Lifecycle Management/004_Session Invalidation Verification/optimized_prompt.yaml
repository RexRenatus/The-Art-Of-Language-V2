active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether absolute session timeouts should be 15 minutes or 8 hours for a high-security
    application like online banking. Support your position with OWASP ASVS v3.0.0 requirements (e.g., V3-8) and usability
    data from sources like NIST SP 800-63B, considering security vs. user experience trade-offs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Topic: Session Invalidation Verification (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Web 008_Application Security

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [REMEMBER: Define key terms... CREATE: Design test case...] Ensure flashcards map to these (label
  each with Bloom''s level).

  - Active Learning: Weave in discussion (timeout debate), peer teaching (mechanisms teach-back), problem-solving (Juice Shop
  testing) as hints/examples in explanations.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers (Foundation: basics; Components: OWASP ASVS/WSTG; Implementation: testing/code;
  Integration: advanced/auth links). Label each with layer.


  Use this Flashcard Schema exactly:

  - Output 25 JSON flashcards as an array of objects.

  - Each: {''front'': ''Q (MCQ with A/B/C/D options)'', ''back'': {''correct_answer'': ''Letter + full explanation (cite OWASP)
  + active learning tie-in'', ''distractors'': [{''option'': ''Text'', ''why_wrong'': ''Explanation + ref''} x3]}, ''bloom_level'':
  ''e.g., Apply'', ''layer'': ''e.g., 3'', ''tags'': [''array of 3-5 relevant tags'']}

  - Distractors: Plausible, common errors (e.g., confuse idle/absolute timeout); balanced types.

  - Content Sources: OWASP ASVS v3.0.0 (V3-8 reqs), WSTG (SESS-05/07), Juice Shop examples, Burp Suite. Definitions: Web session
  (HTTP state), ID (unique link), invalidation (terminate on logout/timeout/pw change).


  Generate comprehensive set covering all objectives/layers. Ensure measurable, active recall (no pure definitions). Vary
  difficulty.'
