active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether 128-bit entropy is sufficient for session tokens today, considering
    modern GPU/ASIC brute-force speeds, quantum threats (e.g., Grover's algorithm halving effective bits), and OWASP guidelines
    (WSTG-SESS-03). Support with calculations of brute-force times and real-world examples from breaches like Equifax.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Use SCAFFOLDING LAYERS for coverage:

  [Insert full scaffolding_layers array here]


  Include ACTIVE LEARNING elements in explanations (e.g., reference discussion on 128-bit sufficiency, Python entropy calc,
  OWASP WSTG-SESS-01/03).


  Generate 25 flashcards following this exact SCHEMA:

  [Insert full flashcard_schema here]


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcard objects. Ensure high-quality: university pedagogy (active recall, spaced repetition),
  plausible distractors from common pitfalls (e.g., confusing entropy with length), web-grounded (OWASP.org citations, Shannon
  formula), real-world (brute-force calcs, breaches). Balance: 4-5 per Bloom''s level, 6-7 per layer. Vary types for engagement.'
