learning_objectives:
  analyze:
  - objective: Compare and contrast CSRF attacks with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), highlighting how XSS can bypass CSRF protections.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  create:
  - objective: Design a CSRF protection implementation for a sample web application, integrating multiple mitigation strategies
      and justifying choices.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  remember:
  - objective: Define Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and list its key components, including exploited browser behaviors
      like automatic cookie transmission.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  understand:
  - objective: Explain how CSRF exploits the trust a web application has in an authenticated user's browser, particularly
      with state-changing requests (e.g., POST, PUT).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  evaluate:
  - objective: Critique the effectiveness of OWASP-recommended CSRF mitigations, such as synchronizer tokens, SameSite cookies,
      and double-submit cookies, in different scenarios.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Identify CSRF vulnerabilities in provided sample code snippets involving session cookies and HTTP requests.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the relative strengths and weaknesses of SameSite cookies versus synchronizer
    tokens for CSRF prevention in modern web apps. Consider browser compatibility, implementation complexity, and edge cases
    like subdomains. Support arguments with OWASP Cheat Sheet references.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Application Security. Topic:\
  \ Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in Web 008_Application Security, under Session Attack Vectors (hierarchy: Cybersecurity\
  \ > 008_Application Security > Web 008_Application Security > 005_Session Management > Session Attack Vectors > CSRF). Use\
  \ provided research context, OWASP prevention strategies (synchronizer tokens, SameSite cookies, double-submit cookies),\
  \ and voter consensus for completeness.\n\nIncorporate:\n- Learning objectives (span Bloom's: remember/define CSRF; understand/exploit\
  \ browser cookies; apply/identify in code; analyze/compare XSS; evaluate/critique mitigations; create/design protections).\n\
  - Active learning for deeper recall (inspired by discussions, peer teaching, problem-solving).\n- Scaffolding: Generate\
  \ flashcards progressively across 4 layers (layer_1_foundation: prereqs/defs; layer_2_components: flows/relations; layer_3_implementation:\
  \ attacks/defenses; layer_4_integration: XSS/session links).\n\nOutput ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcards. Strictly follow\
  \ flashcard_schema: snake_case keys, exactly 3 distractors + distractor_explanations, full fields. Ensure even distribution:\
  \ 20% layer1, 25% layer2, 30% layer3, 25% layer4; Bloom's progression. Questions active/pedagogical (e.g., 'In code X, why\
  \ vulnerable?'). Explanations reference OWASP Cheat Sheet, include why distractors wrong. Sources: OWASP CSRF Prevention\
  \ Cheat Sheet, provided research.\n\nExample flashcard structure:\n{\n  \"question\": \"What does CSRF exploit?\",\n  \"\
  correct_answer\": \"Trust in user's browser\",\n  \"distractors\": [\"Trust in website\", \"User input\", \"Network latency\"\
  ],\n  \"distractor_explanations\": [\"Confuses with XSS\", \"Relates to injection\", \"Not security-relevant\"],\n  \"explanation\"\
