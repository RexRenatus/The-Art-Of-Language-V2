  discussion_prompt: 'In a resource-constrained startup versus a regulated bank, argue for ideal log retention periods that
    balance threat detection, compliance (e.g., GDPR''s 2-year data minimization vs. PCI-DSS''s 1-year requirement), privacy
    risks, and storage costs. Address misconceptions like ''retaining logs indefinitely is always best'' or ''logs are just
    a privacy invasion''. Use think-pair-share: individually brainstorm, pair to debate, share with group.'
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one partner explains core concepts (e.g., log management vs. retention, NIST vs. GDPR standards)
    using real-world examples; the other teach-backs by providing a non-example (e.g., 'deleting logs immediately after generation')
    and quizzing on key terms. Switch roles and link to prior knowledge from Error Handling and Logging (e.g., how logs are
    generated).
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: Company X suffered a web app breach; analyze a hypothetical log dataset (provided: access logs
    showing anomalies over 3 months). Recommend retention policy improvements for faster forensics, considering tools like
    SIEM integration, compression, and compliance (e.g., extend to 1 year per PCI-DSS). Groups present solutions and peer-review.'

  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the full learning_objectives array here]


  **Active Learning Components:** [Insert the full active_learning object here]


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the full scaffolding array here]


  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly follow this output schema: [Insert the full flashcard_schema here]


  Incorporate:

  - Voter consensus: Complete standards (NIST SP 800-92: audit log guidelines; GDPR Art 5(1)(e): minimization, ~2 years; HIPAA:
  6 years PHI; PCI-DSS: 1 year full/3 months online). Link to prior logging knowledge.

  - Research: Logs as event records; management (generate/transmit/store/dispose); retention for forensics/threat detection
  (NIST.gov, learn.microsoft.com).

  - Best practices: Spaced repetition-friendly (active recall, spaced distractors); Bloom''s progression; misconceptions (e.g.,
  indefinite retention ignores costs/privacy).
