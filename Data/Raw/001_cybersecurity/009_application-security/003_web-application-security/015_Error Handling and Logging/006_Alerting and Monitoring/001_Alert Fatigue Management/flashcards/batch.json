        "core_logic": "Increasing the default alert severity for all events is NOT a proactive strategy; it actively contributes to alert fatigue by artificially inflating the perceived importance of all alerts, leading to noise and desensitization. Proactive strategies involve refining detection, improving triage, and reducing false positives.",

Increasing all alert severities is like painting the dashboard red – it looks urgent but doesn't fix underlying issues."
