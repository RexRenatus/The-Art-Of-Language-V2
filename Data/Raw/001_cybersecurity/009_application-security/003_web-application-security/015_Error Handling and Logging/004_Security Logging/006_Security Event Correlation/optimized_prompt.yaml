active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges of implementing security event correlation across heterogeneous
    log sources (e.g., firewalls, IDS, applications). How does it build on basic security logging, and what role does NIST
    SP 800-61 Rev. 2 play in guiding this process? Provide examples from real-world breaches like SolarWinds.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    with simple aggregation); 2) Partial truths (e.g., time-based only, ignoring attributes); 3) Edge cases (e.g., unrelated
    events); 4) Voter-highlighted errors (e.g., ignoring enrichment). Ensure one distractor is a ''superficially correct''
    trap from basic logging.'

  **Core Content Summary** (Web-grounded, voter-completed): Security event correlation analyzes/links logs/alerts across sources
  for threat patterns. Key terms: Event (observable activity), Alert (tool notification), Correlation (relate by time/attributes),
  Enrichment (add context), Incident (confirmed violation). NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-61r2.pdf):
  Core to incident handling—correlate for detection/analysis to prioritize. Tools: Splunk/ELK. Example: Failed logins + escalation
  = attack. Integrates with SOAR/ML/NIST CSF.
