active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between security (shorter timeouts) and user experience
    (longer timeouts) in a banking web app. Propose optimal idle (e.g., 15 minutes) and absolute (e.g., 8 hours) timeout values
    based on OWASP and NIST guidelines, justifying with real-world risks like session hijacking.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education on 'Timeout Handling' (Topic Hierarchy:\
  \ Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Web 008_Application Security > 008_Error Handling and Logging > Exceptional\
  \ Condition Handling > Timeout Handling). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Spaced Repetition, integrating\
  \ university pedagogy (Bloom's Taxonomy progression), active learning, 4-layer scaffolding, and voter consensus (completeness,\
  \ pedagogy, scaffolding).\n\n**Incorporate these exactly:**\n- Learning Objectives: [paste the learning_objectives array\
  \ above]\n- Active Learning: Weave in prompts as 'Apply to scenario' cards.\n- Scaffolding: Distribute cards: 25% Layer\
  \ 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4.\n- Prior knowledge links: Session mgmt/auth.\n- Sources: OWASP WSTG-SESS-07\
  \ (https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/stable/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/06-Session_Management_Testing/07-Testing_Session_Timeout),\
  \ NIST 800-63B/C (https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/).\n- Formative assessments: 20 MCQs w/ distractors, 10 short answer,\
  \ 10 scenarios, 10 reflections.\n\n**Output Format (JSON array of flashcards):**\n[\n  {\n    \"type\": \"MCQ|Q&A|Cloze|Scenario|Reflection\"\
