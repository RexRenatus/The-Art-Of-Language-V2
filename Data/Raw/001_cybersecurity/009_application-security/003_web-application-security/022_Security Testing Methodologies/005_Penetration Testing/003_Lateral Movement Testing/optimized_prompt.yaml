active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical and legal considerations of lateral movement testing in a real-world
    enterprise environment. How does simulating APT techniques like T1021 Remote Services balance red team offensive simulation
    with blue team defensive improvements? Provide examples from MITRE ATT&CK and justify your stance with risk reduction
    benefits.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Penetration Testing and
  MITRE ATT&CK. Generate high-quality flashcards for ''Lateral Movement Testing'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application
  Security > Web 008_Application Security > 021_Security Testing Methodologies > Penetration Testing > Lateral Movement Testing).
  Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema exactly.


  Sources: MITRE ATT&CK TA0008 (techniques: T1021 Remote Services/T1021.001 RDP, T1072 Software Deployment Tools, T1550 Use
  Alternate Authentication Material, T1210 Exploitation of Remote Services); Tools: Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, BloodHound;
  Best practices from CrowdStrike, attack.mitre.org.


  Incorporate pedagogy: Align to Bloom''s (REMEMBER to CREATE); reference scaffolding layers; link to prior knowledge (pentest
  phases, ATT&CK); big picture (APT simulation, dwell time reduction).


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards, each as: {''type'': ''mcq|basic_qa|cloze'', ''layer'': 1-4, ''bloom_level'':
  ''REMEMBER|etc.'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''reference'': ''MITRE T1021|etc.'', ''explanation'': ''Detailed
  rationale + why distractors wrong if MCQ''}.

  Generate 25 flashcards: 6 Layer1, 6 Layer2, 7 Layer3, 6 Layer4. Balance schema types. Ensure distractors per protocol. Make
  engaging, precise, and testable.'
