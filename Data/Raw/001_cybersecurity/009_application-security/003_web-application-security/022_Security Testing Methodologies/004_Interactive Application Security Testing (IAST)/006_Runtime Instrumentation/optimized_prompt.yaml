active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of code-based vs. zero-code runtime instrumentation for
    IAST in a production web app vulnerable to SQL injection. Which method best balances security depth, deployment speed,
    and minimal performance overhead? Support with real-world examples from tools like OpenTelemetry.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Use this optimized content:


  [Insert full learning_objectives, active_learning, scaffolding_layers, flashcard_schema here as context].


  Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom''s progression, active learning hooks (e.g., reference discussion in explanations),
  4-layer scaffolding. Ground in research: OpenTelemetry, signals (traces/metrics/logs), methods (code/zero-code), context
  propagation. Voter consensus: 100% approval on pedagogy/completeness.
