active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether full implementation of all 114 Annex A controls is necessary for ISO
    27001 compliance or if a risk-based approach (selecting controls via Statement of Applicability) is more practical. Use
    real-world examples like the Equifax breach to support your position and address misconceptions that certification is
    a one-time checkbox exercise.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ISO 27001 Compliance Testing
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Web 008_Application Security > 021_Security Testing Methodologies
  > Compliance and Certification Testing > ISO 27001 Compliance Testing). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy progression,
  active learning, 4-layer scaffolding. Voter consensus (100% approval): Emphasize risk-based approach (not all 114 Annex
  A controls mandatory), real examples (Equifax), testing processes (gap analysis, internal audits, Stage 1/2 cert audits,
  surveillance). Research context: ISO 27001 for ISMS (protect CIA of assets); Annex A (14 domains/114 controls); cert by
  third-party; PDCA cycle; links to ISO 27002/NIST.
