active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between flexible wildcard redirect URI matching (for usability)
    and strict exact matching (for security). Use real-world examples from breaches like the 2018 Facebook OAuth flaw to argue
    which should be the default in modern AS implementations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Plausible based on common errors (e.g., confuse 'state' with 'nonce'; wildcard vs. exact matching).
    - One semi-correct (partial truth), one opposite, one unrelated/off-topic.
    - Tie to real misconfigs (e.g., 'Allows wildcards like https://client.com/*' as distractor for strict validation).
    - 'Vary difficulty: easy (recall), medium (apply), hard (analyze/evaluate).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in OAuth Authorization Server

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste the full ''learning_objectives'' array here].

  - Active Learning: Use scenarios from discussion prompts, peer activities, and problem-solving exercises to inspire applied
  questions.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers: [Paste the full ''scaffolding'' array here]. Ensure progression from
  foundation to integration.

  - Content Completeness: Cover OAuth 2.0 basics (RFC 6749), AS weaknesses (redirect_uri validation failures, CSRF via missing
  state, no PKCE), mitigations (exact matching per RFC 6819, PKCE RFC 7636, PAR RFC 9126), RFC 6750 Bearer Usage, OAuth 2.1/OIDC
  links. Sources: OWASP OAuth 2.0 Cheat Sheet (https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/OAuth_2_0_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html),
  RFC 6819 (Threat Model), RFC 8705 (mTLS).


  Generate 25 flashcards following this exact schema:

  {{flashcard_schema structure and rules from above}}.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"front": "Question text with 4 options (A-D)", "back": {"correct": "A.
  Answer (justification)", "explanation": "Full details...", "distractors": ["Why B wrong", "Why C wrong", "Why D wrong"],
  "reference": "Sources...", "blooms_level": "Apply", "scaffolding_layer": 3}}.


  Ensure high pedagogical value: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, tied to real-world vulns.'
