active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare client_secret_basic, client_secret_post, and private_key_jwt authentication methods for the token
    endpoint. Discuss scenarios where sender-constrained tokens (e.g., DPoP, mTLS) mitigate replay attacks better than traditional
    methods, considering OAuth threats from RFC 6819. Address misconceptions like using client secrets for public clients.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives** (Bloom''s Taxonomy): [Paste full learning_objectives array here].

  - **Active Learning**: Use prior knowledge, discussion prompt, peer teaching, and problem-solving exercise for scenario-based
  cards.

  - **Scaffolding**: Distribute cards across 4 layers: [Paste full scaffolding array here].

  - **Sources**: RFC 6749 (OAuth 2.0), RFC 6819 (Threats), RFC 8705 (Client Auth), RFC 9449 (Security BCP), FAPI 2.0 specs,
  OAuth Security BCP draft. Cite in every card.


  Follow this **Flashcard Schema** strictly [Paste full flashcard_schema here]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcards,
  each as: {"type": "[type]", "scaffolding_layer": "[1-4]", "blooms_level": "[REMEMBER/etc]", "front": "[question text]",
  "back": {"answer": "[answer]", "explanation": "[explanation]", "reference": "[source]"}}. Ensure active recall, no hints
  on front. Vary difficulty progressively.'
