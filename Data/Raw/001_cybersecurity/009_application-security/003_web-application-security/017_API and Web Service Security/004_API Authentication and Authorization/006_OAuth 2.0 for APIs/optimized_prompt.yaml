active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the security implications of using Implicit Grant versus Authorization Code with PKCE in modern
    SPAs. What misconceptions lead developers to choose insecure flows (e.g., assuming Implicit is simpler), and how can OAuth
    2.0 best practices (RFC 6749, 7636, 6819) mitigate them? Support arguments with real-world examples like social media
    integrations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Base on common misconceptions: e.g., confuse Client with Resource Owner; recommend Implicit Grant for SPAs; omit PKCE;
      mix authentication with authorization.'
    - 'Use outdated practices: Implicit Grant as ''secure''; long-lived tokens without refresh.'
    - 'Incorporate real pitfalls from RFC 6819: e.g., insecure redirect URIs, token leakage via logs/URLs.'
    - 'Plausible but wrong: Swap roles (e.g., Authorization Server as token validator); wrong grant for app type (Client Credentials
      for user-delegated access).'
    - 1 correct, 3 distractors per MC; ensure distractors are 70% plausible from voter/research context.

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (20% Cloze, 50% MCQ, 30% Short Answer) covering all Bloom''s levels and 4 scaffolding
  layers. Ensure completeness: RFC 6749 (core spec), RFC 6819 (threats), RFC 7636 (PKCE), RFC 6750 (Bearer), best practices,
  vulnerabilities (CSRF, token leakage), OIDC/JWT integration.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Tie explanations to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards: 25% Layer1, 25% Layer2, 25% Layer3, 25% Layer4.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly:

  - Output JSON array of objects: {''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'':
  1-4, ''explanation'': ''...'', ''references'': ''...'', ''difficulty'': ''Easy/Medium/Hard''}.

  - Distractors per protocol: Common pitfalls/misconceptions.


  Prioritize voter consensus (100%): Pedagogy, completeness, peer interaction. Use research context: OAuth as authorization
  framework, roles/tokens/grants detailed.


  Ensure cards promote active recall, spaced repetition, and university pedagogy.'
