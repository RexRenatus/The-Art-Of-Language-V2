active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of using JWT for stateless API authentication in a high-traffic
    microservices architecture versus traditional session-based auth. Consider scalability, security risks like token theft,
    and zero-trust implications. Provide real-world examples from sources like API7.ai.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
