  discussion_prompt: 'Debate: Is POST inherently more secure than GET for sensitive data? Provide examples where GET might
    be safer (e.g., no CSRF risk for read-only) and vice versa (e.g., POST avoids URL logging), considering caching, logging,
    and verb tampering risks. Reference real-world cases like e-commerce order placement.'
  peer_teaching: 'Students pair up: Partner A explains idempotency/safe/cacheable properties with examples/non-examples (e.g.,
    GET safe/idempotent/cacheable; POST not idempotent; DELETE idempotent but unsafe), then quizzes Partner B. Switch roles
    and extend to security mitigations like method restrictions.'
  problem_solving: 'Given a vulnerable API snippet allowing unauthorized PUT/DELETE (e.g., no method checks), students fix
    it by adding restrictions (e.g., via Express.js middleware or Apache config), authz (RBAC), and test with curl/Postman.
    Real-world simulation: Secure an e-commerce API where misused DELETE deletes orders; include idempotency keys for PATCH.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, following university pedagogy:
  Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, and 4-layer scaffolding. Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on ''HTTP Method Security
  (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)'' in the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Web 008_Application
  Security > 017_API and Web Service Security > REST 006_API Security > HTTP Method Security.


  Incorporate research context: HTTP methods per RFC 7231 (safe/idempotent/cacheable); security risks (GET: URL leaks/XSS;
  POST: dupes/CSRF; PUT: overwrites/uploads; DELETE: deletions; PATCH: mass assignment); mitigations (method restrictions,
  authz, idempotency keys, WAFs); OWASP API Top 10 (verb tampering); complete coverage of PUT/DELETE/PATCH per voter consensus.


  Use these EXACT learning objectives: [paste learning_objectives array].

  Embed active learning hooks: [summarize active_learning].

  Structure content via scaffolding layers: [paste scaffolding array].


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards in this schema: [{''front'': ''question'', ''back'': ''answer'', ''explanation'':
  ''detailed with source/Bloom/link'', ''distractors'': [''A'', ''B'', ''C''], ''scaffolding_layer'': 1-4, ''bloom_level'':
  ''REMEMBER'', ''type'': ''MCQ/QA/code''}]. Ensure 70% MCQs with 3 distractors per protocol. Cards must be optimized for
  Anki/Quizlet: concise front, spaced repetition-friendly, no spoilers. Cover completeness gaps (OPTIONS/TRACE briefly, best
  practices). Prioritize voter pedagogy (55.7% approval).'
