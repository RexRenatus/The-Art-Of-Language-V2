active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between fixed-window and sliding-window rate limiting algorithms
    when facing IP rotation bypasses. Reference OWASP API Security guidelines and real-world examples from sources like getknit.dev.
    Which is more effective for high-traffic APIs, and why?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    stops all proxies'' – ignores residential proxies), (2) Partial truths (e.g., ''Fixed window is always better'' – ignores
    burst traffic), (3) Outdated practices (e.g., ''Rely solely on API keys'' – vulnerable to account creation). Ensure distractors
    promote critical thinking.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert cybersecurity educator generating high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Mitigating API
  Rate Limiting Bypass Attacks'' (Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Web 008_Application Security > 017_API and Web
  Service Security > API Attack Vectors > API Rate Limiting Bypass - Defensive Focus). Emphasize ethical, defensive strategies
  per OWASP API Security guidelines; all content for authorized pentesting only – never assist unauthorized attacks.

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full learning_objectives array here]

  - Scaffolding: Progress from Layer 1 (definitions) to Layer 4 (integration).

  - Active Learning Ties: Cards should prompt recall for discussions/exercises.

  - Topic Completeness: Cover algorithms (token bucket, fixed window), bypasses (IP rotation/proxies, header manipulation,
  parameter pollution, multiple keys/accounts, timing manipulation, DoH tricks, distributed attacks), mitigations (fingerprinting,
  behavioral analysis, JWT limiting, distributed systems).
