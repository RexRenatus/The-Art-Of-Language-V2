active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a software supply chain attack like SolarWinds, how would lack of code signing enable malware insertion?
    Debate the trade-offs of mandatory signing (e.g., developer burden vs. security gains) in small groups, citing real-world
    examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on
  ''Application Code Signing'' using the provided structure.


  **Context:**

  - Topic Hierarchy: {level_1: ''Cybersecurity'', level_2: ''008_Application Security'', ... level_6: ''Application Code Signing''}.

  - Use scaffolding layers, objectives, prior knowledge, concept map, research (code signing for executables/firmware/apps/containers;
  standards: NIST, Authenticode, etc.).

  - Balance: 4 Remember/Understand, 8 Apply/Analyze, 8 Evaluate/Create, 5 mixed.

  - Active learning tie-ins: Questions mimicking discussion/problems (e.g., scenarios).

  - Voter priorities: SMART objectives, 4 layers, exactly 3 distractors w/explanations.


  **Output:** Valid JSON array of flashcards matching EXACT schema. No deviations, no markdown, pure JSON.


  **Schema:** [paste full flashcard_schema.structure here]


  Ensure flashcards scaffold: 30% Layer1-2, 40% Layer3, 30% Layer4. Sources: NIST SP800-193, Microsoft Docs, Apple Developer.'
