    because it requires knowledge of internal class structures.'' Use real-world examples from OWASP incidents to support
    your arguments, considering impacts like RCE and data tampering.'

  **Learning Objectives** (span all levels, reference by ID 1-6):

  1. REMEMBER: Define...

  [Full list as above]


  **Scaffolding Layers** (generate 5-8 cards per layer, balanced across objectives):

  - Layer 1 Foundation: [Full desc]

  - Layer 2 Components: [Full desc]

  - Layer 3 Implementation: [Full desc]

  - Layer 4 Integration: [Full desc]


  **Active Learning Integration**: Cards should prompt recall for discussions (e.g., debate cards), peer quizzes (teachable
  facts), problem-solving (code analysis).


  **Sources**: OWASP Deserialization Cheat Sheet (https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Deserialization_Cheat_Sheet.html),
  A08:2021 Software/Data Integrity. Emphasize insecure deserialization, not general injection. Include PHP/Java examples,
  ysoserial/PHPGGC, mitigations (whitelisting, JSON).


  **Voter Consensus (84.3% approval)**: Prioritize clarity, progression, completeness (XSS comparison, preventions, examples),
  hands-on, accuracy.


  **Generate 30 high-quality flashcards**:

  - Cover all objectives/layers proportionally.

  - 70% application/analysis level or higher.

  - Variety: definitions, code ID, comparisons, mitigations, scenarios.

  - Follow exact Flashcard Schema:

  Output ONLY a JSON array: [{''question'': ''...'', ''options'': {''A'': ''...'', ''B'': ''...'', ...}, ''correct'': ''A'',
  ''explanation'': ''...'', ''tags'': [''remember'', ''layer1'', ''1'']}, ...]. No extra text.'
