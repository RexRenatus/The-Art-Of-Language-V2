  Security'', ''Level 4: 015_Software 015_Supply Chain Security'', ''Level 5: Package and Repository Security'', ''Level 6:

  **Research Context (Complete & Grounded):** Private Package Registry Security focuses on securing internal package storage
  (e.g., like npm/PyPI but private). Core concepts: Package registry (stores/distributes packages), software supply chain
  (dev-build-distribute process), adversaries (inject malware), provenance (artifact history), SBOM (component inventory).
  Standards: SLSA (levels for build/source security; Build Track: secure builds/provenance; Source Track: tamper-resistant
  source); OpenSSF OSPS Baseline (best practices: RBAC access controls, vulnerability scanning, package signing w/ Sigstore,
  immutability, replication protection). Best practices: Auth (tokens), scanning (e.g., Trivy), signing (cosign), SBOM integration.
  Prior knowledge: Public registries (npm, PyPI), supply chain basics (Domain 015).


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives from above].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers from above].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Ensure flashcards support discussion (e.g., risk comparisons), peer teaching (e.g., explain
  standards), problem-solving (e.g., scenarios).


  **Task:** Generate 30 flashcards following the exact schema: {question, correct_answer, bloom_level, scaffolding_layer,
  explanation, distractors: [{text, explanation}, ... (exactly 3)]}. Vary bloom_level evenly across 6 levels. Balance across
  4 layers. Questions: Mix MCQ (with distractors as options), short answer, scenario-based. Output as JSON array of objects.
  Make educational: Explanations reference objectives/layers/standards. No duplicates; high-quality, precise.'
