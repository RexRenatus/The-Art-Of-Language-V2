active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a world where third-party libraries speed up development but introduce risks like supply chain attacks
    (e.g., Log4Shell or SolarWinds), debate whether developers should prioritize open-source reuse or build everything in-house.
    Support your position with pros, cons, real-world examples, and mitigation strategies such as SCA tools or SBOMs.
  peer_teaching: 'Pair students: Student A explains ''Software Supply Chain (SSC)'' and key risks (vulnerabilities, malicious
    code, transitive dependencies) using OWASP cheat sheets, then quizzes Student B. Student B performs a teach-back on ''Vulnerable
    Dependency Management,'' addressing common misconceptions like ''open-source is always safe.'' Switch roles and discuss
    findings as a group.'
  problem_solving: 'Provide a sample npm package.json or Python requirements.txt with known vulnerable dependencies (e.g.,
    including lodash with CVE-2021-23337). Students: 1) Scan using npm audit, pip-audit, or Snyk; 2) Identify and prioritize
    CVEs by severity; 3) Propose fixes (update, substitute, monitor); 4) Document in a report. Debrief on challenges like
    transitive dependencies.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Third-Party Library Security
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Web 008_Application Security > 015_Software Supply Chain Security
  > Dependency Management > Third-Party Library Security). Synthesize high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized flashcards
  using university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives, active learning (discussion/peer-teaching/problem-solving), 4-layer
  scaffolding (Foundation: defs; Components: risks/package mgrs; Implementation: scanning/tools; Integration: SBOM/CI/CD/policies),
  and prior knowledge (basic dev, npm/pip, OWASP A06:2021).


  Core Content:

  - Foundation: Third-party libs, SSC, Vulnerable Dep Mgmt.

  - Components: Risks (vulns, malicious code, transitive deps, version pinning, DoS, supply chain attacks e.g. Log4Shell/SolarWinds);
  package mgrs (npm/pip).

  - Implementation: npm audit/Snyk/Dependabot; CVE prioritization.

  - Integration/Best Practices: SBOMs, CI/CD, approved versions, OWASP cheat sheets.

  Learning Objectives: [Insert the 6 objectives from above].

  Active Learning Ties: Incorporate prompts referencing discussion (reuse vs in-house), peer-teaching (SSC risks teach-back),
  problem-solving (scan sample package.json).


  Generate 60 flashcards per the schema:

  - Varied types: 20% definition/cloze, 30% MCQ, 20% application, 15% analysis, 15% scenario/eval/create.

  - Balance: 10 per Bloom''s level; cover all scaffolding layers.

  - Schema: JSON array of objects [{front: ''...'', back: {answer: ''...'', explanation: ''... (incl Bloom level, layer, why
  correct/distractors wrong, real-world)'', sources: ''...'', difficulty: ''Easy/Medium/Hard''}}].

  - Distractors: 3 plausible per MCQ, based on misconceptions (explain why wrong).

  - Optimize for Anki: Concise fronts, rich backs; active recall; no hints.

  Ensure completeness, accuracy, and engagement. Output only the JSON array.'
