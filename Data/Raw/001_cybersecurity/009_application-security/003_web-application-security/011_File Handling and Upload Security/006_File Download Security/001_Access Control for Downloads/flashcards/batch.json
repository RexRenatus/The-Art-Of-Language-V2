        "core_logic": "Path traversal vulnerabilities occur when an application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input used in file paths. An attacker can use sequences like '../' to navigate up the directory tree and access files outside the intended web root or download directory, potentially exposing sensitive system files.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors describe different vulnerabilities: XSS (malicious scripts), weak authentication (credential compromise), and DoS (resource exhaustion). Path traversal specifically exploits how file paths are constructed and accessed.",
        "analogy": "Path traversal is like giving someone a map to a specific room in a building, but they use a secret shortcut ('../') on the map to get into the building manager's office instead of the intended room."

Encryption adds another layer of defense, making the data unreadable even if the file is somehow accessed improperly, because it protects the data's confidentiality.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors suggest insecure practices like public access, insecure storage, or relying on obscurity, all of which are inadequate for protecting sensitive configuration data.",
        "analogy": "Securing sensitive configuration data downloads is like protecting a safe containing important documents. You need a strong lock (authentication/authorization) and ideally, the documents inside should be further protected (encryption) in case the safe is breached."
