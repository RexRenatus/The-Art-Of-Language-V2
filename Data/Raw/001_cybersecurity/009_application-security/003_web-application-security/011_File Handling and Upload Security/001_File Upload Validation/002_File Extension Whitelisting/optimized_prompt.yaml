  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the limitations of relying solely on file extension whitelisting for upload security: Is it sufficient
    on its own, or must it be layered with MIME type validation and content scanning? Reference real-world breaches (e.g.,
    Equifax file upload flaws leading to RCE) and NIST SP 800-167 principles to support arguments.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    uppercase check without normalization). Ensure distractors are realistic from voter/research (e.g., null byte as ''safe
    trick'').'

  Consensus: 84.3% approval.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Active Learning: [insert full active_learning JSON].

  - Scaffolding: 4 Layers [insert full scaffolding JSON].

  - Research: NIST SP 800-167 (deny-by-default, app whitelisting principles); bypasses (double ext, case sens, null byte,
  MIME mismatch); defense-in-depth vs RCE.


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (10-15 per Bloom''s pair: Remember/Understand, Apply/Analyze, Evaluate/Create; balanced
  across layers). Use Flashcard Schema exactly:

  Front: Question [Bloom-Layer].

  Back: Answer | Explanation (w/ research/active link) | Sources.

  Vary: 40% MCQ (3 distractors per protocol), 30% Cloze, 30% Short Answer.

  Prioritize higher-order thinking, misconceptions, code snippets.


  Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''blooms_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''...''}]. Ensure measurable,
  engaging, university-level pedagogy.'
