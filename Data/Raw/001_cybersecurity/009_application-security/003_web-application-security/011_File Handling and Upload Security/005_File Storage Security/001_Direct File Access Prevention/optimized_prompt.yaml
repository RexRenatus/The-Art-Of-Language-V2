active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In small groups, discuss real-world examples of data breaches caused by direct file access vulnerabilities
    (e.g., exposed user uploads in SaaS apps leading to leaks in 90% of file-related incidents). Propose how least privilege
    and .htaccess rules could have prevented them, citing NIST SP 800-53 AC-3 and AC-6.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Big Picture: Essential for secure web apps; prevents direct URL access to uploads/configs, mitigating 90% file-related breaches
  (e.g., SaaS user data leaks).

  - Scaffolding: [paste full 4 layers]

  - Active Learning: [reference for examples]

  - Voter Consensus: 82.9% approval; emphasize completeness (NIST full), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression, hands-on), web examples
  (.htaccess, PHP scripts).


  Generate 25-30 high-quality flashcards PER THE EXACT FLASHCARD SCHEMA: Mix formats, cover all objectives/layers (Layer1:
  20%, L2:20%, L3:30%, L4:30%). Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition, distractors for analysis. Output
  ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects, e.g., [ {...}, {...} ]. No extra text.'
