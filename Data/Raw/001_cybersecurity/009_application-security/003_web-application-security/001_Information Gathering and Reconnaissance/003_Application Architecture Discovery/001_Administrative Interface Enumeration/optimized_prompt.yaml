  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Topic Details: Core concepts (admin interfaces for user mgmt/config; enumeration to find hidden ones; privilege escalation
  risks). Techniques: Common paths (/admin, /phpmyadmin, /wp-admin), tools (Gobuster, DirBuster, ffuf), methods (brute-force,
  fuzzing, HTTP checks). OWASP WSTG-CONF-05. Examples: Exposed Jenkins, SolarWinds. Prior: Recon basics. Big Picture: Pentesting
  attack surface discovery.

  DevGuide.


  Follow Flashcard Schema: [INSERT FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Ensure distractors per protocol. Distribute by Bloom''s (Remember/Understand:
  30%, Apply/Analyze: 40%, Evaluate/Create: 30%) and scaffolding (even coverage). Cards must be optimized for active recall,
  with explanations tying to objectives/activities.
