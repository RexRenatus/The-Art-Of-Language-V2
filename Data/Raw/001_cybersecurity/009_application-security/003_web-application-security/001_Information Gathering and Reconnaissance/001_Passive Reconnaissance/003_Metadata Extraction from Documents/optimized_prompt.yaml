  discussion_prompt: 'In a forum or group discussion, debate the ethical implications of metadata extraction in passive reconnaissance:
    ''Should organizations be required to strip metadata from publicly shared documents? Provide examples from real-world
    breaches (e.g., EXIF data revealing locations) and counterarguments based on forensic value.'' Encourage participants
    to reference standards like EXIF or Dublin Core.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate:

  - Research: Metadata types (descriptive, structural, administrative, app, system, embedded); standards (EXIF images, ID3
  audio, XMP Adobe, Dublin Core descriptive); apps in forensics/OSINT/threat intel (tu.com, kaspersky.com).

  - Voter consensus (82.9% approval): Completeness on standards; pedagogy via Bloom''s (objectives provided); 4-layer scaffolding
  (use below); tools (exiftool ''exiftool file.jpg'', strings, MetaDetective, FOCA, Metagoofil).

  - Prior knowledge: Links to passive recon/OSINT, no network interaction.
