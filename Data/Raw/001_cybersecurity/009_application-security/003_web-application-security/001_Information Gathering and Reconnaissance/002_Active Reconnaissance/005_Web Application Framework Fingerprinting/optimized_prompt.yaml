active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical implications of framework fingerprinting in penetration testing
    versus its use by malicious actors. How does revealing framework details (e.g., jQuery version via JS files) impact security?
    Reference OWASP WSTG-INFO-08 and propose mitigation strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education on ''Web Application Framework Fingerprinting''
  (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Web 008_Application Security > 002_Information Gathering and Reconnaissance
  > Active Reconnaissance > Web Application Framework Fingerprinting). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives
  [insert learning_objectives array here], active learning [discussion/peer/problem-solving], 4-layer scaffolding [insert
  scaffolding array here].


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following this schema [insert flashcard_schema here].


  Incorporate voter consensus: OWASP WSTG-INFO-08 details, obfuscation (header removal, custom headers, JS hiding), best practices
  (check robots.txt, /admin/, error pages, JS libs like jQuery, tools: WhatWeb/Wappalyzer/Retire.js/Burp/curl). Research:
  Black-box testing, frameworks (WordPress/Django/Rails/PHP), artifacts (headers/errors/files).
