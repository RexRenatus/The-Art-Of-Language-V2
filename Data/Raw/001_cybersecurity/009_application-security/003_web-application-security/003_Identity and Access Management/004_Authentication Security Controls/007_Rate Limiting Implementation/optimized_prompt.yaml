active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of token bucket vs. sliding window algorithms for rate limiting
    login endpoints. Consider scenarios like flash crowds vs. sustained DoS attacks. How does this align with NIST SP 800-63
    recommendations for authentication security?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    1. Common confusion (e.g., ''Token Bucket allows unlimited bursts'' vs. burst up to bucket size).

    2. Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Fixed Window is always best for simplicity'' ignoring edge bursts).

    3. Irrelevant/extreme (e.g., ''Rate limiting blocks all traffic'' vs. excess only). Ensure plausible for learners at intermediate
    level.'
