active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using IVR for high-assurance (AAL3) authentication versus
    traditional MFA methods. Consider usability, security risks like voice deepfakes, and compliance with NIST SP 800-63.
    Support arguments with evidence from standards and case studies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]

  - Active learning: Tie flashcards to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving where relevant.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [INSERT scaffolding_layers HERE]; tag each card with layer.


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards using this schema [INSERT flashcard_schema HERE].


  Content must be comprehensive: Cover truncated NIST SP 800-63B-4 (AAL1: single-factor e.g., PIN; AAL2: multi or strong single;
  AAL3: phishing-resistant multi), threats (vishing, spoofing, deepfakes, replay), best practices (PIN 8+ chars alphanumeric,
  no KBQs, voice biometrics, MFA, recording), prior IAM knowledge, case studies (e.g., Capital One vishing), sources (NIST
  SP 800-63A/B/C: https://pages.nist.gov/800-63/).
