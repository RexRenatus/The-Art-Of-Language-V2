active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, analyze how inadequate role definitions contributed to real-world breaches (e.g.,
    privilege escalation in SolarWinds or Capital One incidents). Propose mitigations using OWASP best practices and debate
    the trade-offs between role granularity and usability.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    permissions''), (2) Partial truth (e.g., ''Test only client-side''), (3) Extreme opposite (e.g., ''No need for least privilege'').
    Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter suggestions and research (e.g., over-privileging errors).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education on ''Role Definition Testing'' (Topic Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Web 008_Application Security > 005_Identity and 002_Access Management > 001_Identity
  Management > Role Definition Testing). Generate 30 high-quality flashcards covering all Bloom''s levels and 4 scaffolding
  layers provided below. Use the exact flashcard schema. Ensure 40% MCQs (with distractors), 40% short answer, 20% true/false.
  Distribute evenly: 5 per layer, spanning objectives.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full array from above]

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full array from above]

  **Active Learning Context:** Incorporate elements like OWASP Juice Shop testing for applied cards.

  **Research Context:** Roles/permissions/RBAC/granularity per OWASP WSTG-IDNT-01; least privilege testing (fuzzing, unauthorized
  actions, server-side checks); NIST/ISO integration.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 30 flashcards, e.g., [{''type'': ''mcq'', ...}, ...]. No extra text.'
