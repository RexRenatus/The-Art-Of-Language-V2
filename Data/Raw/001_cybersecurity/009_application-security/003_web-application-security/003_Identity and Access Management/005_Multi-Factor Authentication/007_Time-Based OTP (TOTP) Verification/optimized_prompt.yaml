active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the security trade-offs of TOTP versus SMS-based OTPs. Consider scenarios like time synchronization
    failures, phishing attacks, or SIM-swapping—when might TOTP fail, and how can it be mitigated? Support arguments with
    references to RFC 6238 and NIST SP 800-63B.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Base on common misconceptions: e.g., confuse TOTP time step with HOTP counter; use SMS OTP traits (network-dependent);
      wrong hash (MD5 instead of SHA1); ignore truncation.'
    - 'Plausible but incorrect: Close numerical values for computations; outdated standards; reversed roles (client vs server).'
    - 1 easy (obvious error), 1 medium (subtle mix-up), 1 hard (edge case like drift).
    quantity: Exactly 3 per card, randomized order.
