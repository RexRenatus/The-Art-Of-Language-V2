active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In light of XS-Leaks, debate whether the benefits of web composability outweigh the security risks. Argue
    for or against stricter browser policies beyond SOP, using real-world examples like login status detection via timing
    oracles or search result oracles via error events.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema. Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (balance
  across 6 objectives), active learning (embed discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving hooks), 4-layer scaffolding, voter
  consensus (completeness on leaked info types/examples/mitigations/sources).


  Content foundation:

  - Prior knowledge: SOP from Web Security.

  - Layers: [Insert full scaffolding here].

  - Objectives: [Insert full learning_objectives array here].

  - Active learning: [Insert full active_learning here].

  - Leaked info: User identity (login/email), browser history, CSRF tokens, private messages, internal network.
