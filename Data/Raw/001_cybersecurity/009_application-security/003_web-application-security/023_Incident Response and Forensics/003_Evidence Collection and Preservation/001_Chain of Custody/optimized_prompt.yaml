  discussion_prompt: 'In groups, discuss: How does a broken chain of custody in a digital forensics investigation (e.g., handling
    malware from a web app breach) differ from physical evidence mishandling? Link to real-world cases like the SolarWinds
    incident and debate mitigations. Encourage critical thinking on legal vs. operational consequences.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Application Security (Domain:

  Research Context: Chain of Custody is a documented trail tracking asset (physical/digital, e.g., web server data) movement/control,
  ensuring integrity/authenticity/admissibility. Key terms: Asset, Integrity (unaltered), Accountability (who handled), Transparency
  (visible docs), Broken Chain (gaps questioning validity). Importance: Risk mitigation (reduces tampering), legal admissibility
  (court evidence), forensics reliability, IR lifecycle integration. Procedures: Document handlers/dates/purposes/hashes (SHA-256);
  forms with signatures; steps: secure, hash, transfer, store, analyze. Sources: CISA (https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-12/Chain%20of%20Custody_2023.8.14_508.pdf),
  NIST (https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/chain_of_custody), SANS Institute, ISO 27037.
