  discussion_prompt: 'In groups, analyze a real-world data breach case (e.g., Equifax or Capital One): Categorize causes (human
    error, insider threats, third-party risks, external attacks) and debate the best DLP countermeasures—technology (e.g.,
    DLP tools, encryption) vs. policies vs. training. Justify with evidence from the case and predict prevention outcomes.'
  peer_teaching: 'Think-pair-share: Pair up and explain DLP protections for data at rest, in motion, and in use to your partner;
    partner teaches back using non-examples (e.g., what NOT to do, like unencrypted email for data in motion). Debrief misconceptions
    as a class.'
  problem_solving: 'In teams, design a DLP strategy for a web app handling PII: Identify risks (e.g., third-party integrations),
    select tools (e.g., encryption, monitoring), simulate a leak scenario (e.g., insider exfiltration via phishing), and outline
    prevention steps. Present and peer-review for gaps.'

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (mix remember/understand, apply/analyze,
  evaluate/create per objectives below), active learning hooks (e.g., reference discussions on Equifax), 4-layer scaffolding
  (foundation: definitions/causes; components: tools/policies; implementation: steps; integration: zero-trust/compliance),
  prior knowledge links (CIA triad, access control).


  Incorporate completeness: Full causes (human error primary, insider/external/third-party like supply chain/misconfigs);
  DLP strategies/tech (discovery, inspection, encryption, endpoint/network/cloud tools, monitoring/policies).
