      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Defining strict response schemas is a key defense against Excessive Data Exposure because it explicitly dictates what data fields an API should return. This works by enforcing data structure and content server-side, thereby preventing the accidental inclusion of sensitive or unnecessary information in API responses.",
