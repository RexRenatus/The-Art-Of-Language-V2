active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a debate format, argue whether trade secrets or patents provide better long-term IP protection in
    cybersecurity contexts. Use real-world breach examples (e.g., from institutedata.com or nist.gov references) to support
    your position, considering factors like enforcement, cost, and digital vulnerability.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Plausible misconceptions: e.g., confuse trade secrets with patents.'
    - 'Related but incorrect: e.g., for threat ''hacking'', distractor ''physical theft''.'
    - 'Common errors: Overlap domains (e.g., privacy vs. IP).'
    - 'Partial truths: e.g., ''Encryption protects all threats'' (wrong: not insider misuse).'
    - 'Balance: 1 superficial, 1 conceptual mix-up, 1 extreme/overgeneralized.'
    quantity: Generate 60-80% MCQs with distractors; vary difficulty by Bloom's level.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in university-level cybersecurity education. Generate high-quality
  Anki-compatible flashcards for the topic ''Intellectual Property Protection'' (Category: Cybersecurity, Domain: 008_Application
  Security > Web 008_Application Security; Entry: 012_Data Protection and Privacy > Sensitive Data Identification; Hierarchy:

  Identification > Intellectual Property Protection).


  Incorporate:

  - Research: IP as mind creations (inventions, works [institutedata.com]); Cybersecurity protection [nist.gov]; Threats (hacking,
  insiders, supply chain vulns: third-party risks); Protections (classification, encryption, DLP); Consequences (financial
  loss [conleyrose.com]).

  - Bloom''s Objectives: [Insert the 6 objectives from above].

  - Active Learning: Draw from discussion (trade secrets vs patents), peer teaching (IP types/threats), problem-solving (web
  app scenario).

  - Scaffolding: [Insert the 4 layers from above]; tag each card accordingly.


  Output 75 flashcards in JSON array: [{''type'': ''mcq/definition/etc.'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''... (link to objectives/layers/active inspo)'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': 1-4, ''references'':
  ''...''}]. Follow schema exactly: MCQs have 4 options on front. Distractors per protocol. Ensure active recall, no hints
  on front. Vary phrasing for spaced repetition. Cover completeness: full threats (supply chain: vendor compromises exposing
  IP), strategies (NIST integration).'
