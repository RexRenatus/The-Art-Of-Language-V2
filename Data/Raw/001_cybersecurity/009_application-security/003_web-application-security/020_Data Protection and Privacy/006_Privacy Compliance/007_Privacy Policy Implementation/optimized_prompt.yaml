active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'Discuss the Equifax data breach (2017): How could NIST Privacy Framework Functions (e.g., Govern and
    Protect) have mitigated the privacy risks? What lessons apply to modern web applications under GDPR/CCPA? (Encourage critical
    thinking: debate trade-offs between privacy and usability.)'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (simpler wrong answers for higher levels). Ensure 70% plausibility to challenge without frustrating.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Privacy Policy Implementation
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Web 008_Application Security > 012_Data Protection and Privacy
  > Privacy Compliance > Privacy Policy Implementation).


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema: {front, back, explanation, distractors (array of 3), bloom_level,
  scaffolding_layer, active_hook (optional string)}.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full array from above]

  - Active Learning: Tie in hooks where relevant (e.g., Equifax for discussions).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute 6-7 cards per layer [paste full scaffolding array]. Use correct NIST Privacy Framework: Functions
  (Govern, Identify, Control, Communicate, Protect), Profiles (current/target), Tiers (1-4).

  - Research: NIST PF 1.0, Privacy by Design, PII, GDPR/CCPA, web app sec links.

  - Best Practices: Active recall, spaced repetition friendly; explanations scaffold from foundation to integration; distractors
  per protocol.


  Ensure completeness (full Profiles/Tiers), accuracy (no outdated functions), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression, measurable
  verbs). Output as JSON array of flashcard objects. No extra text.'
