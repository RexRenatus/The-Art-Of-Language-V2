        "core_logic": "Failing to enforce data retention policies means that data, including sensitive information, is kept longer than necessary. This accumulation increases the overall volume of data an organization holds, thereby expanding the attack surface. Consequently, the risk and potential impact of a data breach are significantly amplified because more sensitive data is exposed.",
