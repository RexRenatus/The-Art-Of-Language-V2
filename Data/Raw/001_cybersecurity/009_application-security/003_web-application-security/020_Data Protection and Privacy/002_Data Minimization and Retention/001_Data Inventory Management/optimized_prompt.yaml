active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the challenges of maintaining an up-to-date data inventory in a rapidly scaling cloud environment.
    How do frameworks like the NIST CSF 'Identify' function balance comprehensiveness with practicality, especially regarding
    data minimization and retention policies? Consider real-world pressures like compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and misconceptions
    such as treating inventory as a one-time task.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - D2: Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., confuses DSPM with DLP).

    - D3: Opposite or extreme (e.g., ignores maintenance). Base on voter-noted misconceptions (e.g., static inventory) and
    research (e.g., NIST vs. non-NIST frameworks). Ensure distractors test nuance.'

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM JSON]

  - Active Learning: Inspire cards with discussion/peer/problem-solving elements (e.g., cloud challenges, DSPM teach-backs,
  healthcare cases).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [PASTE FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM JSON]. Ensure progressive complexity; reference
  prerequisites.

  - Research Context: NIST CSF Identify function, DSPM (Cyera), OT Taxonomy/Asset Inventory (CISA), data confidentiality (NIST),
  TLP for classification.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly [PASTE FULL SCHEMA FROM JSON]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, e.g., [ {flashcard1},
  {flashcard2}, ... ]. Cover all objectives/layers, use voter priorities (pedagogy, completeness, engagement). Ensure active
  recall, no hints in fronts.'
