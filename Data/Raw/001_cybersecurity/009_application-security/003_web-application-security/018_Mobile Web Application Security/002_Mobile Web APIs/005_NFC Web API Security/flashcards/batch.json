        "core_logic": "The experimental nature of the Web NFC API means its security features might not be fully implemented or tested across all browsers, leading to potential vulnerabilities and inconsistent security postures, because widespread adoption and hardening take time.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly suggest guaranteed encryption, a lack of NDEF support, or the use of outdated protocols, missing the core security implication of an API's experimental status: potential implementation gaps and lack of maturity.",
        "analogy": "Using an experimental Web NFC API is like using a beta version of software; it might work, but you should be cautious about its stability and security until it's fully released and tested."
