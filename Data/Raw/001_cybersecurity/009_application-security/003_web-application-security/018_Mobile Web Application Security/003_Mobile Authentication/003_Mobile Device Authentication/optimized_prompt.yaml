active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of biometric (inherence) vs. multi-factor authentication for mobile banking apps.
    Reference NIST AALs, vulnerabilities like fingerprint spoofing or SIM swapping, and user convenience. Which is better
    for high-stakes scenarios? Support arguments with evidence from NIST SP 800-63B-4 and real-world examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
