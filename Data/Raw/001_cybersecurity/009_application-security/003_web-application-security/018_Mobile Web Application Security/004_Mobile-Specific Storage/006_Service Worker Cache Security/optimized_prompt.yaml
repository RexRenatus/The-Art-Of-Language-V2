  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using Service Worker caching for offline functionality
    in mobile web apps: How do performance benefits weigh against risks like persistent malicious Service Workers or MITM
    attacks? Propose scenarios where caching should be avoided and justify using voter-suggested mitigations like HTTPS-only
    and cache versioning.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Prior knowledge: Basic Service Workers, HTTP proxies, web caching.

  - Research context: Service Workers as proxy for PWAs enable offline/caching but risk MITM, cache poisoning, persistent
  malicious SW (intercept post-unload). Mitigations: HTTPS-only, cache versioning, SRI, scope restriction, secure reg/unreg,
  updates.

  - Scaffolding layers: [insert full layers above]

  - Active learning ties: Reference discussions/problems in explanations.

  - Voter consensus: Emphasize mitigations, complete risks (persistent SW), best practices.
