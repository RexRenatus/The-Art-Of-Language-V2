active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between user experience (e.g., real-time status sharing
    in tools like Slack or Zoom) and privacy risks (e.g., 'away' status exploitation for social engineering). Propose mitigations
    and vote on the most balanced approach.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Base on misconceptions: e.g., confuse identity proofing with authentication; overlook Respond/Recover in NIST CSF.'
    - 'Use real-world twists: e.g., ''Zoom-like status is always private'' as distractor.'
    - 'Progressive difficulty: Layer 1 (definitional errors), Layer 4 (integration failures).'
    - Avoid 'all/none/never' traps; ensure 60% plausibility.
