  Incorporate these learning objectives [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY]. Use active learning for context: [INSERT active_learning_components
  OBJECT]. Structure content across scaffolding layers: [INSERT scaffolding_layers ARRAY].


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following this schema: [INSERT flashcard_generation_schema OBJECT].


  Draw from research: ICE candidates (host, srflx via STUN, relay via TURN); RFC 8445 processes (gathering, checks, nomination);
  WebRTC SDP/Trickle ICE; Security: IP leakage, privacy risks, mitigations (TURN-only, filtering, mDNS). Voter consensus:
  82.9% approval emphasizes pedagogy, security completeness.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcards, e.g., [ {front: ''...'', back: {...} }, ... ]. Ensure university-level rigor:
  Bloom''s progression, active recall, spaced repetition optimization. No additional text.'
