      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "While both involve taking an application offline, decommissioning implies a more comprehensive and permanent secure disposal. This means ensuring all associated data, configurations, and infrastructure are securely erased or destroyed, going beyond simple uninstallation to prevent any future residual risks.",
