  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the relative priority of sample application removal compared to other security
    misconfigurations (e.g., default credentials). Use real-world examples like exploited Tomcat manager apps to support your
    arguments, referencing OWASP A05:2021 and CIS Benchmarks. What misconceptions (e.g., confusing removal with application
    whitelisting) arise, and how can they be addressed?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    with disabling services); 2) Drawn from related but incorrect concepts (e.g., whitelisting steps instead of deletion);
    3) Platform-specific variants (e.g., Apache dir for Tomcat question); Ensure one mimics a frequent real-world mistake

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Sample Application Removal''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Web 008_Application Security > 009_Security Misconfiguration
  > Application Configuration > Sample Application Removal). Focus exclusively on removing default/sample web applications
  (e.g., Tomcat /examples/manager, IIS davwwwroot/iisstart.htm, Apache /test) from production servers to mitigate misconfigurations—avoid
  tangential topics like whitelisting/containers.


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert full 4 layers above]

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to discussion/peer teaching/problems (e.g., scenario-based Qs).

  - Prior Knowledge: Link to web server basics/misconfigs.

  - Sources: OWASP Top 10 A05:2021 (Security Misconfiguration), CIS Benchmarks, NIST SP 800-123 (Server Security), OWASP Secure
  Coding.
