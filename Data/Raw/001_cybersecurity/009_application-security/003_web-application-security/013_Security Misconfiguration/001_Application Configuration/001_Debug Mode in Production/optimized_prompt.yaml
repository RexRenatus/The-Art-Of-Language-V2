  ''Debug Mode in Production'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Web 008_Application Security > 009_Security
  Misconfiguration > Application Configuration > Debug Mode in Production). Use this optimized learning content:


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full learning_objectives array here]


  **Active Learning:** [Insert full active_learning_components array here] – Inspire flashcards that prompt recall for these
  activities.


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full scaffolding_layers array here] – Distribute flashcards across layers (10-15 per layer).


  **Research Context:** Core Concepts: Debug Mode (diagnostics/errors); Prod Env (live/real data). Risks: Info Disclosure
  (schemas/creds/paths), Attack Surface, DoS (resource use), Compliance (GDPR/HIPAA). OWASP: Top 10 A05 Security Misconfig;
  Secure Coding: Disable debug/stack traces (LOG01, ERR01). Best Practices: Env vars (DEBUG=false), CI/CD checks, monitoring.
