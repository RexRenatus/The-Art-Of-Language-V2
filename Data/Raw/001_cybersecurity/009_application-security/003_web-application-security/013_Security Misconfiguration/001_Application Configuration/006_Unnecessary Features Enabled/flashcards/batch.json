        "core_logic": "A robust change control process ensures that any addition or modification, including enabling features, is properly vetted for security implications before deployment. Because features should only be enabled when necessary and justified, this process prevents the accidental or intentional enablement of risky, unused components.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The correct answer emphasizes a proactive process (change control) for managing features. Distractors suggest a reactive approach, over-reliance on tools, or prioritizing speed over security, all of which increase the risk of unnecessary features.",
        "analogy": "Requiring a formal request and approval from a manager before a new tool is added to the workshop, rather than letting anyone bring in any tool they find; this ensures only necessary and safe tools are introduced."
