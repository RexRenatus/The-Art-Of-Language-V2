    get-bucket-acl), the other role-plays remediation and quizzes the teacher.'

    (az storage blob list) to audit, apply private policies, and document changes in a shared report.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on
  ''Public Cloud Resource Exposure'' (Category: Cybersecurity, Domain: 008_Application Security, Subdomain: Web 008_Application
  Security, Entry Domain: 009_Security Misconfiguration, Entry Subdomain: Cloud Configuration Security). Use the exact topic
  hierarchy: Level 1: Cybersecurity → Level 2: 008_Application Security → Level 3: Web 008_Application Security → Level 4:
  009_Security Misconfiguration → Level 5: Cloud Configuration Security → Level 6: Public Cloud Resource Exposure.


  Core content: Public cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP) resource exposure via misconfigs (public buckets, open ports), vulns, weak ACLs
  leading to breaches. Standards: NIST CSF (Identify/Protect), ISO/IEC 27017 (cloud controls), 27018 (PII). Prerequisites:
  Basic cloud (public/private), general misconfigs.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [insert array above verbatim].

  - Scaffolding: Balance cards across 4 layers [insert scaffolding verbatim].

  - Active learning hooks: Reference scenarios like AWS S3 audit, Azure blob sim in explanations.

  - Concept map: Central exposure → causes/effects/mitigations.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards. Each card STRICTLY follows schema: {''question'': str, ''correct_answer'': str,
  ''distractors'': [{''text'': str, ''explanation'': str}, ... (EXACTLY 3)], ''explanation'': str (pedagogical, Bloom''s-aligned,
  scaffold-referenced, source-cited)}.


  Ensure: University pedagogy (active recall, spaced repetition), measurable verbs, voter consensus (82.9% approval), no structure
  inconsistencies. Cards progress from REMEMBER (Layer1) to CREATE (Layer4).'
