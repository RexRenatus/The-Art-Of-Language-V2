  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using default ports for convenience versus changing
    them for security: What are the risks of predictability (e.g., Nmap scans), and when might defaults be acceptable? Support
    with real-world examples like the Mirai botnet.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

  - Use common misconceptions (e.g., confuse well-known with registered ports)
  - Include similar ports/services (e.g., 8080 as 'default HTTP' vs true 80)
  - Incorporate real errors (e.g., unsecured changes without firewall)
  - Avoid obvious wrongs; make plausible based on research (e.g., dynamic ports as 'well-known')
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education on ''Default Port Configuration'' (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Web 008_Application Security > 009_Security Misconfiguration > Server
  and Platform Configuration > Default Port Configuration). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities,
  4 scaffolding layers, and flashcard schema to create high-quality, pedagogically optimized flashcards.


  Incorporate:

  - Security risks: Predictable ports enable Nmap scanning, automated attacks (e.g., Mirai on defaults like 23/Telnet).

  - Standards: IANA (RFC 6335, RFC 7605), NIST SP 800-44 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-44ver2.pdf),
  OWASP A06:2021.

  - Sources: IANA Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml),
  RFC 6335 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6335.html).


  Follow Bloom''s Taxonomy progression. Output ONLY in JSON array of flashcards, each matching the schema: {''front'': ''Question
  with A/B/C/D options'', ''back'': {''correct_answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''D1 reason'',
  ''D2 reason'', ''D3 reason''], ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''related_activity'': ''...''}}.


  Generate 25 flashcards spanning all objectives and layers, with distractors per protocol. Ensure active learning ties (e.g.,
  ''Relates to problem-solving exercise'').'
