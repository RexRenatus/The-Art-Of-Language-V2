      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The TRACE method echoes the request back to the client. If enabled without proper sanitization or restrictions, an attacker can craft a malicious request (e.g., via JavaScript) that includes sensitive information (like session cookies) in the TRACE request, which is then reflected back to the attacker's script, enabling XST.",
        "distractor_analysis": "While TRACE is for diagnostics, its reflection capability creates an XST vulnerability. It is not directly related to SQL injection or general efficiency.",
        "analogy": "It's like a mirror that reflects everything shown to it; if sensitive information is shown, the mirror reflects it back, potentially to someone who shouldn't see it."
