When the server's certificate expires and is replaced, the new certificate will not match the pinned credential. Because the client application enforces this strict match, it will reject the connection, preventing users from accessing the API until the client-side pinning configuration is updated.",

      ],
      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Public key pinning enhances security by allowing applications to trust specific server public keys directly, rather than relying solely on the chain of trust from a Certificate Authority. This is crucial because if a CA is compromised or issues fraudulent certificates, attackers could potentially impersonate servers. Pinning bypasses this vulnerability by enforcing trust in a known, pre-defined key, thereby preventing sophisticated man-in-the-middle attacks.",
