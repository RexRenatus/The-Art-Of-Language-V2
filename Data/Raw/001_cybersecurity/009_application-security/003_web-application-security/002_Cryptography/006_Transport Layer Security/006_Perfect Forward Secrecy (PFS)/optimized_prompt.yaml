active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a world where server private keys are compromised years later (e.g., via supply chain attacks), debate
    the trade-offs of mandating PFS in all TLS connections versus performance overhead. Consider TLS 1.3's PFS mandate and
    tools like SSL Labs for verification.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    PFS''), 1 from partial truths (e.g., ''Only protects future sessions''), 1 from unrelated concepts (e.g., ''Symmetric

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education on ''Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)'' (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Web 008_Application Security > 001_Cryptography > Transport Layer
  Security > Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)). Synthesize 50 high-quality flashcards using university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy
  objectives [insert learning_objectives array], active learning components [insert active_learning object], and 4 scaffolding
  layers [insert scaffolding_layers object].


  Incorporate research: PFS uses ephemeral keys (DHE/ECDHE) for session keys, protecting past sessions from long-term key
  compromise; TLS 1.3 mandates PFS; cipher suites e.g., ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384; tools: SSL Labs, nmap; misconceptions:
  RSA != PFS.


  Voter consensus (100%): Completeness on standards/frameworks; pedagogy progression; active elements; concept map (PFS →
  Ephemeral Keys → Session Keys → TLS).


  Generate flashcards per schema [insert flashcard_schema object]: JSON array of objects with ''front'' and ''back'' (incl.
  answer, explanation, bloom_level, scaffolding_layer, active_learning_link). Ensure variety, distractors from misconceptions,
  scaffolding progression (Layer 1: 20 cards, Layer 2: 15, Layer 3: 10, Layer 4: 5). Output only the JSON array.'
