active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: Pair students to explain envelope encryption to a partner using a simple analogy (e.g., a locked box inside
    a safe containing the data encryption key), then switch roles and quiz each other on key management implications.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A company''s database was breached, exposing patient records. Design an encryption strategy
    covering data at rest, in transit, and in use. Justify choices with best practices (AES-256, HSMs, key rotation) and standards
    (ISO 27001, GDPR).'
