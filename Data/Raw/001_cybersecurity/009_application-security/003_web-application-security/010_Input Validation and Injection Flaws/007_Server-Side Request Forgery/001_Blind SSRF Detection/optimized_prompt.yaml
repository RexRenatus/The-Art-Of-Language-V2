active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast blind SSRF with traditional SSRF. What makes detection more challenging, and how
    might defenders use timing-based, error-based, or out-of-band (OOB) oracles to infer success? Discuss real-world implications
    for bug bounty hunting.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MC: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Blind SSRF always leaks
    responses'' vs. reality). 2) Partial truth (e.g., ''Timing attacks require direct response''). 3) Related but wrong concept
    (e.g., confuse with CSRF). Base on voter priorities (e.g., timing vs. OOB errors) and research (e.g., internal discovery
    impacts). Ensure distractors test analysis/evaluation.'

  learning, and scaffolding. Topic: Blind SSRF Detection (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Web 008_Application
  Security > 007_Input Validation and Injection Flaws > Server-Side Request Forgery > Blind SSRF Detection). Use provided
  research context (blind SSRF definitions, indirect feedback, impacts like internal discovery), voter suggestions (complete
  detection methodologies: timing/sleep payloads, OOB/DNS/Interactsh/Burp Collaborator, error inference, port scanning, HTTP
  methods), and this prompt''s elements.


  Learning Objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]

  Active Learning: [INSERT active_learning OBJECT HERE] – Weave hooks into explanations.

  Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT scaffolding_layers ARRAY HERE] – Generate 20-50 flashcards (5-15 per layer) spanning all layers/objectives.

  Flashcard Schema: [INSERT flashcard_schema OBJECT HERE] – Strictly follow.


  Generate flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet: Markdown format with --- separators. Each card: **Layer X | Bloom: Y** |
  Front | --- | Back. Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition, misconceptions via distractors. Cover
  completeness (payload examples, tools, strategies). Output ONLY the list of flashcards in JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'',
  ''back'': ''...'', ''layer'': 1, ''bloom'': ''Remember''}, ...]. No intro text.'
