active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast Redis Injection with traditional SQL Injection. In what scenarios might Redis Injection
    be more dangerous (e.g., high-performance caching environments), and why? Debate the effectiveness of input sanitization
    versus parameterized queries in Redis, citing OWASP A05:2025-Injection guidelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  [Question]

  A) Distractor1

  B) Distractor2

  C) Correct Answer

  D) Distractor3


  **Answer:** C) Correct Answer


  **Explanation:** [Detailed, 2-4 sentences, reference Bloom''s level, layer, objective, source (e.g., OWASP A05: https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2025-Injection/,
  Redis security: https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/). Include code examples: Vulnerable
  (e.g., `redis_client.execute(''GET'', user_input)`), Secure (parameterized).]


  **Metadata:** Bloom''s: [Level], Layer: [1-4], Objective: [#]


  Best Practices Coverage: Parameterized queries, avoid EVAL/user input, ACLs, validation, monitoring.

  Distractor Protocol: Plausible errors (misconceptions like ''Redis cache immune'', SQLi confusion, partial mitigations).

  Vary formats: 70% MCQ, 20% Cloze (e.g., ''Redis injection occurs when user input is ___ into commands: concatenated/escaped''),
  10% Short-answer.

  Ensure university-level: Active recall, spaced repetition optimized, no hints in questions.'
