active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, explore the real-world consequences of CRLF injection attacks (e.g., cache poisoning
    leading to XSS or phishing). Share examples from historical breaches and debate the most effective prevention layer (client-side
    vs. server-side).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
