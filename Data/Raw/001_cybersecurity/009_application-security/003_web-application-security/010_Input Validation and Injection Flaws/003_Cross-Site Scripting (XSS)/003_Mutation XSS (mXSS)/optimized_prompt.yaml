active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Why do discrepancies between sanitizer parsers and browser engines enable mXSS? Debate the trade-offs
    between strict parsing (e.g., in DOMPurify) and browser forgiveness, considering real-world impacts on usability and security.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [REMEMBER] Define mXSS/differences; [UNDERSTAND] Parser discrepancies; [APPLY] Predict outputs; [ANALYZE]
  Break down examples (e.g., SVG ''<svg><animatetransform onbegin=alert(1)>'', <isindex>, table tags); [EVALUATE] Mitigations
  (DOMPurify, CSP); [CREATE] Design PoCs.

  - Active Learning: Discussion on discrepancies/trade-offs; Peer teaching with flowcharts; Problem-solving: Analyze payloads
  from Gareth Heyes/PortSwigger labs.

  - Scaffolding: Layer 1 Foundation (defs, XSS recap); Layer 2 Components (quirks/contexts); Layer 3 Implementation (full
  examples: input/sanitized/browser result); Layer 4 Integration (DOM-XSS links, mitigations).


  Research Context: mXSS exploits sanitizer-browser parser diffs; browser fixes malformed HTML (e.g., SVG onload mutations).
