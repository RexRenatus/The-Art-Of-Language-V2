active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare Stored XSS with Reflected and DOM-based XSS. Why is Stored XSS particularly insidious in collaborative
    platforms like forums or social media? Debate using real-world examples like the 2018 British Airways breach where attackers
    stole customer data via a Stored XSS payload in a chatbot.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol:
    rules:
    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse Stored with Reflected), 2) Partial
      truth (e.g., correct for another XSS type), 3) Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., ''always requires user click'').'
    - Avoid 'all/none' options; ensure one clear correct.
    - 'Base on research: Use real payloads/tools but twist (e.g., Burp for reflected only).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 40 high-quality flashcards on
  ''Stored XSS Testing'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Web 008_Application Security > 007_Input
  Validation and Injection Flaws > Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) > Stored XSS Testing). Cover all learning objectives, active
  learning elements, and 4 scaffolding layers evenly (10 cards per 2 layers).


  Incorporate:

  - Prior knowledge: Basic XSS, input validation, HTTP.

  - Research: Stored XSS = persistent script stored server-side; impacts: session hijack, theft; testing: OWASP WSTG-INPV-02
  payloads (<script>alert(1)</script>), Burp Suite; mitigations: output encoding, CSP.

  - Active elements: Discussion comparisons, peer teaching payloads/DVWA, problem-solving exercises.


  Use this schema exactly:

  - 15 Basic Q&A

  - 15 MCQ (4 options, 1 correct)

  - 10 Cloze

  Follow distractor protocol strictly.


  Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''MCQ|Q&A|Cloze'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''objective'': ''Remember'',
  ''layer'': ''1'', ''explanation'': ''...''}]

  Ensure active recall, spaced repetition friendly: Varied difficulty, no hints on front.'
