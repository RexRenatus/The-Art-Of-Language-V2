  discussion_prompt: 'Debate: Is there ever a valid reason for developers to implement custom cryptography instead of using
    established libraries like OpenSSL or Bouncy Castle? Use NIST SP 800-57 guidelines and real-world breaches (e.g., custom
    RC4 in early WhatsApp or Sony PS3 ECDSA nonce reuse) to argue trade-offs, risks, and alternatives.'
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains the differences between symmetric and asymmetric keys, along with the full
    key management lifecycle (generate, distribute, store, use, destroy, revoke); the partner quizzes them with examples and
    common misconceptions (e.g., 'symmetric keys are always faster and sufficient'), then switch roles.
  problem_solving: 'Given pseudocode for a ''secure'' custom XOR cipher in a web app for session protection: def encrypt(data,
    key): return ''''.join(chr(ord(c) ^ ord(key[i % len(key)])) for i, c in enumerate(data)). Students identify flaws (weak
    algorithm, predictable key generation, no integrity checks), redesign using standard libraries (e.g., AES-GCM via OpenSSL),
    simulate attacks (replay, known-plaintext), and test in a mock web session scenario.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Custom 001_Cryptography
  Implementation'' (Category: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Web 008_Application Security > 003_Insecure Design
  > Cryptographic Design Flaws). Topic warns AGAINST custom crypto; emphasize using NIST-compliant libraries (OpenSSL, Bouncy
  Castle) to avoid Insecure Design flaws per OWASP Top 10.

  Output ONLY a JSON array of objects, e.g. [{''front'': {''question'': ''...'', ''options'': {''A'': ''...'', ...}}, ''back'':
  {...}, ''metadata'': {...}}, ...]. Ensure coverage: 40% Remember/Understand (Layer 1-2), 30% Apply/Analyze (Layer 3), 30%
  Evaluate/Create (Layer 4). Distractors challenge misconceptions like ''custom crypto is okay for speed''. Align with voter
  consensus (100% approval): completeness (full NIST), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression), active learning, accuracy (no custom
  crypto endorsement).'
