active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between ambient authority (convenience in development) and
    explicit permission models (security). Use real-world examples like AWS IAM ambient credentials or OAuth 2.0 flows to
    argue which is preferable for high-security web applications, citing NIST guidelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 20 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Spaced Repetition, covering the full topic with university pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Use these exact elements:


  **Learning Objectives** (span all levels): [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ''learning_objectives'']


  **Active Learning Integration**: Ensure flashcards prompt recall for discussions (e.g., ''Debate trade-offs''), peer teaching
  (e.g., ''Explain to peer''), problem-solving (e.g., ''Fix this vuln'').


  **Scaffolding**: Distribute cards across 4 layers – 5 cards per layer: [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING CONTENT].


  **Flashcard Schema** (strict format, JSON per card): Follow exactly – [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD_SCHEMA]. Generate mix: 40%
  cloze, 40% MCQ (4 options, 1 correct), 20% short answer. Include 2-3 MCQs with formative assessment style distractors.


  **Content Rules**:

  - Voter Consensus (68.6% approval): Emphasize completeness (full NIST SP 800-63B-4: explicit consents in identity mgmt),
  examples (OAuth, AWS IAM), prior knowledge (RBAC/ACLS), concept map refs.

  - Examples/Non-Examples: OAuth implicit, AWS ambient creds; non: capability systems.

  - Mitigations: Least privilege, explicit checks, zero trust.

  - Sources: Always cite (e.g., NIST links).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 20 flashcards: [{''id'':1, ''layer'':''1'', ''bloom_level'':''REMEMBER'', ''front'':''...'',
  ''back'':{''answer'':''...'', ''explanation'':''...'', ''distractors'':[''A'',''B'',''C''], ''related_concept'':''...''}},
