active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the effectiveness of enforcing password complexity rules (e.g., uppercase, numbers, symbols) versus
    minimum length requirements of 8+ characters. Use evidence from NIST SP 800-63B-4, which prioritizes length over complexity,
    and reference real-world breaches like the 2013 Yahoo incident where weak requirements led to mass compromises. Argue
    for or against, considering usability, security, and user behavior.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Distractors must be plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., '6 characters' vs. NIST's 8; 'require symbols' vs.
      'no composition rules').
    - Draw from real breaches (e.g., Yahoo used weak complexity) or outdated standards.
    - '1 distractor: Too weak (e.g., shorter length).'
    - '1 distractor: Overly complex/outdated (e.g., mandatory special chars).'
    - '1 distractor: Irrelevant/misapplied (e.g., ''Unlimited length'' ignoring usability).'
