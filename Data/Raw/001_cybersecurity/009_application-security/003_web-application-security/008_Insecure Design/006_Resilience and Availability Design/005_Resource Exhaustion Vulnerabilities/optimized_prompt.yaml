active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between aggressive rate limiting (which prevents exhaustion
    but may block legitimate users) and permissive policies (which risk DoS). Use real-world examples like Slowloris or third-party
    SMS quota exhaustion to support your arguments, and link to OWASP API4:2023 guidelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on voter-noted misconceptions (e.g., 'Rate limiting authenticates users' vs. true
      'limits requests'; confuse memory exhaustion with CPU; mix OWASP API4 with API1).
    - 'Draw from common errors: Overemphasis on authentication over quotas; ignoring third-party costs; assuming firewalls
      prevent all DoS.'
    - Ensure 1-2 highly plausible (near-miss), 1 absurd for calibration.
    count: 'Generate 20-30 flashcards: 5-8 per Bloom''s cluster (Remember/Understand, Apply/Analyze, Evaluate/Create); balanced
      across 4 layers.'

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives: [insert learning_objectives array here]

  - Active learning: Tie flashcards to [discussion_prompt, peer_teaching_activity, problem_solving_exercise]

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [insert scaffolding_layers here]

  - Research context: Resource exhaustion depletes CPU/memory/bandwidth/storage/third-party quotas leading to DoS; key refs:
  OWASP API4:2023 (Unrestricted Resource Consumption), API4:2019 (Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting), CWE-400, OWASP DoS Cheat
  Sheet (analyze components, input validation); examples: Slowloris, regex DoS.

  Ensure university pedagogy: Progression via Bloom''s, active recall, spaced repetition-friendly. Voter consensus (82.9%):
  Emphasize mitigations (rate limiting, validation), real examples, MCQs with distractors on misconceptions.
