active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of using NIST SP 800-53A versus ISO 27001 for Security Requirements Gap Analysis
    in a resource-constrained web application development team. Provide examples of gaps each framework might prioritize differently
    (e.g., NIST's emphasis on control assessments vs. ISO's management system focus) and discuss implications for OWASP Top
    10 mitigation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

      based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse NIST with ISO priorities; mix up current/desired state; overlook web-specific
      OWASP gaps). Ensure distractors are realistic errors from insecure design contexts.'

  Gap Analysis'' in the hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Web 008_Application Security > 003_Insecure
  Design > Design Flaw Identification > Security Requirements Gap Analysis. Focus on web application security and insecure
  design flaws (e.g., OWASP Top 10 gaps like missing input validation).


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]

  - Active Learning: Use as inspiration for scenario-based cards (e.g., discussion trade-offs NIST vs. ISO; peer-teach steps;
  problem-solve OWASP gaps).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers: [INSERT scaffolding ARRAY HERE].


  Use this synthesized content:

  - Core Concepts: [From research: Cybersecurity Gap Analysis definition, Security Requirements, Desired/Current State, Gaps].

  - Standards: NIST SP 800-53A (control assessments), ISO 27001, OWASP Top 10.

  - Best Practices: Full steps from Layer 3.

  - Integration: Risk mgmt, threat modeling links.


  Output a JSON array of flashcards strictly following this schema: [INSERT flashcard_schema.structure HERE]. Adhere to distractor
  protocol for MCQs. Ensure explanations reference web app examples, standards, and pedagogy. Vary difficulty; make engaging
  for active recall. Generate exactly 50 flashcards.'
