active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs between permissive cross-domain policies (e.g., allowing '*' access from any
    domain) and strict ones in RIAs. Using real-world breaches like the 2010 Twitter Flash vulnerability, debate whether overly
    restrictive policies hinder legitimate functionality or if permissiveness invites exploitation. Provide examples of balanced
    configurations and reference OWASP WSTG-CONF-08.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    entirely'' vs. ''relax SOP''); (2) Confusable term (e.g., clientaccesspolicy.xml as Flash-only); (3) Edge case error (e.g.,
    non-root location). Ensure distractors test subtle differences in permissions/syntax from research context.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in RIA Cross Domain Policy
  Testing (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Web 008_Application Security > 013_Configuration and
  Deployment Management > Cross-Domain Policy Testing > RIA Cross Domain Policy Testing). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards
  (30 Q&A, 20 MCQ) optimized for Anki/Quizlet, covering all Bloom''s levels and scaffolding layers evenly.


  **Learning Objectives (ensure coverage):** [Insert full list from JSON above].


  **Scaffolding Layers (distribute 12-13 cards per layer):** [Insert full layer descriptions from JSON above].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Weave in hooks (e.g., ''Relate to discussion on Twitter vulnerability'').


  **Flashcard Schema (strictly follow):** [Insert full schema from JSON above].


  **Content Sources:** Base on OWASP WSTG-CONF-08, research context (RIAs: Flash/Silverlight; crossdomain.xml at root for
  Adobe/Java; clientaccesspolicy.xml for Silverlight; permissions for sockets/XHR; SOP relaxation), voter priorities (pedagogy,
  completeness). Prioritize secure configs, risks (permissive ''*''), testing steps.


  **Output Format (JSON array):** [{''type'': ''Q&A'' or ''MCQ'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''hints'': [...], ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''...''}}]. Ensure variety, no duplicates, progressive difficulty.'
