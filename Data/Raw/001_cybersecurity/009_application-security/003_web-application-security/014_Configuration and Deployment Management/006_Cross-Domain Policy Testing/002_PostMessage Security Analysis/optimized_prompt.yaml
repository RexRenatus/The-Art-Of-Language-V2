active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given the CVE-2024-49038 vulnerability, debate whether convenience in cross-origin communication justifies
    relaxed origin validation in postMessage. What real-world scenarios (e.g., third-party iframes in banking apps) might
    tempt developers to use wildcards like '*', and how can strict validation be enforced without breaking functionality?
    Support arguments with references to OWASP guidelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Trust event.source over origin. 3) Omit validation for ''performance''. 4) Confuse with CORS/SOP. Ensure distractors
    are realistic from real-world vulns (e.g., CVE-2024-49038). Always include ''why_wrong'' explanations tied to security
    risks.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate high-quality MCQ flashcards for
  the topic ''PostMessage Security Analysis'' using the EXACT topic hierarchy: {''level_1'': ''Cybersecurity'', ''level_2'':
  ''008_Application Security'', ''level_3'': ''Web 008_Application Security'', ''level_4'': ''013_Configuration and Deployment
  Management'', ''level_5'': ''Cross-Domain Policy Testing'', ''level_6'': ''PostMessage Security Analysis''}.

  - Active Learning: [PASTE FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [PASTE FULL 4 LAYERS FROM ABOVE]

  - Prior Knowledge: SOP, JS window objects, iframes.

  - Industry Standards: OWASP Testing Guide v4 (cross-origin testing), CSP guidelines (frame-ancestors), NIST SP 800-53.

  - Concept Map: As in Layer 1.


  Use the Flashcard Schema: [PASTE FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Ensure even coverage: 20% per Bloom''s level, 25% per scaffolding
  layer. Questions must promote active recall, critical thinking, and error-prone concepts (e.g., origin vs source). Output
  ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcards in the specified format. Include topic_hierarchy in each card''s back for tracking.'
