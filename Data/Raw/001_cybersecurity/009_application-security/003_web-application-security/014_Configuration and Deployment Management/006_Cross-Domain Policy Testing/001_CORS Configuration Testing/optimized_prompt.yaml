active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between usability and security when using wildcard (*) in
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin versus listing specific origins. Provide real-world examples of data leaks caused by misconfigured
    CORS and propose mitigation strategies grounded in the Principle of Least Privilege.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Distractors must be plausible based on common misconceptions: 1) Literal misreads (e.g., confuse Access-Control-Allow-Origin
    with Access-Control-Allow-Methods), 2) Edge cases (e.g., wildcard * as ''always secure''), 3) Partial truths (e.g., ''Pre-flight
    only for POST''), 4) OWASP-inspired vulns (e.g., ''Origin header is tamper-proof in all contexts''). Ensure distractors
    teach by contrast.'

  Generate 75 high-quality Anki flashcards on ''CORS Configuration Testing'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application
  Security > Web 008_Application Security > 013_Configuration and Deployment Management > Cross-Domain Policy Testing > CORS
  Configuration Testing). Consensus from voters (82.9% approval): Emphasize Bloom''s Taxonomy progression, 4-layer scaffolding,
  prior knowledge (SOP/HTTP basics), complete best practices (Principle of Least Privilege: specify exact origins/methods/headers,
  avoid *, validate credentials; secure vs. insecure examples), OWASP WSTG testing (curl/Burp/dev tools), big picture (prevents
  OWASP A05:2021 misconfigs/data leaks).


  Incorporate research: CORS relaxes SOP via headers (Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Origin/Methods/Headers/Credentials). Pre-flight
  OPTIONS for non-simple requests. Risks: permissive origins, spoofing.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the exact array from ''learning_objectives'' above]. Balance cards: 20% Remember/Understand,
  30% Apply/Analyze, 50% Evaluate/Create.


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert descriptions from ''scaffolding_layers'' above]. Distribute cards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer
  2, 30% Layer 3, 20% Layer 4.


  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Infuse cards with discussion-style questions (e.g., ''Debate risks of...''), peer-teach explanations,
  problem-solving scenarios.
