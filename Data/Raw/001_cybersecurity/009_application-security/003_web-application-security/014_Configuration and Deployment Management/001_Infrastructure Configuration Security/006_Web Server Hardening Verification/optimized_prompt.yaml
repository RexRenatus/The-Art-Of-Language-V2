active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the misconception that 'web server hardening is a one-time task.' Discuss real-world examples
    where ongoing verification failed (e.g., unpatched servers leading to breaches), and propose strategies for continuous
    monitoring. Reference NIST SP 800-44 to support arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on voter-noted misconceptions (e.g., 'Hardening is one-time',
    'Only for public servers') or common errors (e.g., outdated practices, over-simplification). Ensure 1-2 are 'almost correct'
    (partial truth) for higher-order thinking.

  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 008_Application Security > Web 008_Application Security > 013_Configuration and Deployment
  Management > Infrastructure Configuration Security > Web Server Hardening Verification). Voter consensus (70% approval):
  Emphasize NIST SP 800-123 (Guide to General Server Security) and SP 800-44 Rev. 2 (Guidelines on Securing Public Web Servers).
  Complete best practices: OS hardening (non-root, permissions), disable services, patching, firewalls, SSL/TLS, logging,
  least privilege, network segmentation.
