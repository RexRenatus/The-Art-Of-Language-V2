active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the forensic implications of relying solely on SIM card recovery for SMS
    in a SIM swap attack scenario (MITRE ATT&CK T1451). What evidence might be missed, and how does this connect to broader
    mobile device forensics? Support your points with references to NIST SP 800-86 or 3GPP standards.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

      - D1: Common misconception (e.g., confuse EF_SMS with EF_IMSI).

      - D2: Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''All SMS stored on SIM'' vs. limited capacity).

      - D3: Related but irrelevant (e.g., mix with device IMEI forensics).

      Ensure distractors are web-grounded (e.g., from SIM swap myths) and promote critical thinking.'

  Device Forensics > SIM Card and Cellular Forensics > SMS Message 005_Recovery from SIM.


  **Topic Hierarchy Context:** Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Digital Forensics > 009_Mobile Device
  Forensics > SIM Card and Cellular Forensics > SMS Message 005_Recovery from SIM. Focus on forensic recovery of SMS from
  SIM (EF_SMS), not attacks; include SIM swap context for investigations. Key elements: EF_SMS structure (3GPP TS 51.011),
  tools (Cellebrite UFED, Oxygen Forensic, PySIM, SIM readers), standards (NIST SP 800-86, 800-101, NISTIR 7617), procedures
  (APDU, chain of custody), limitations.


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list from above].

  - Scaffolding: Progress from Layer 1 (foundation) to Layer 4 (integration); tag each card.

  - Active Learning: Ensure cards link to discussion/peer/problem-solving (e.g., ''Relates to SIM swap debate'').

  - Prior Knowledge: Link to basic SIM structure/SMS protocols.


  **Generation Instructions:**

  - Create 25 flashcards using the exact schema: Front (question + tags), Back (answer, explanation, references, active_link).

  - Balance: 4-6 cards per Bloom''s level; 5-7 per scaffolding layer.

  - Distractors: Strictly follow protocol (3 per MCQ, plausible/web-grounded).

  - Voter Priorities: Emphasize recovery techniques, completeness (tools/procedures/standards), pedagogy (measurable objectives).

  - Output Format: JSON array of objects, e.g., [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''references'': [...], ''active_link'': ''...''}}].

  - Best Practices: University-style (active recall, spaced repetition); no fluff, high fidelity to forensics.
