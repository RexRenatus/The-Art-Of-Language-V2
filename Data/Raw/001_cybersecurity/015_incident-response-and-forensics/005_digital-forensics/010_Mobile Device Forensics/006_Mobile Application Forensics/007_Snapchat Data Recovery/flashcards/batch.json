Analyzing these traces helps reconstruct events and activities, including those within the Snapchat app.",

        "core_logic": "The ephemeral design of Snapchat media means content is intended for deletion. Therefore, recovery efforts must be timely and employ specific forensic techniques to capture data before it is permanently removed or overwritten, as standard backups or simple recovery methods are often insufficient.",
