        "core_logic": "Rooting an Android device grants privileged access, enabling direct acquisition of the unencrypted <code>msgstore.db</code> and other files from WhatsApp's Application Sandbox. Logical backups, conversely, rely on app-provided APIs and may not capture all data or could yield encrypted formats, making rooted acquisition generally more forensically complete.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The correct answer accurately contrasts the direct, unencrypted access from rooting with the potentially limited or encrypted nature of logical backups. Distractors misrepresent which method accesses cloud data, the scope of acquisition, or the effect of rooting on encryption.",
        "analogy": "Rooting is like having a master key to the entire filing cabinet (sandbox) to read all documents directly, while logical backup is like asking the receptionist for specific files, who might only give you copies or summaries."
