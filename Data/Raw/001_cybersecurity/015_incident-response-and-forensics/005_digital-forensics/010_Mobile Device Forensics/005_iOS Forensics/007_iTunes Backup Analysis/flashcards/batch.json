        "core_logic": "Logical or backup acquisition, like using iTunes backups, requires the iOS device to be unlocked to access user-accessible data. NIST guidelines emphasize that forensic processes must not alter the original evidence, making methods that overwrite data inadmissible. Therefore, ensuring the device is unlocked and the acquisition is non-intrusive is critical.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The first distractor incorrectly mandates physical imaging for logical acquisition. The second distractor wrongly suggests a known password bypasses the 'unlocked' requirement for logical access. The third distractor ignores the critical forensic principle of not altering evidence.",
        "analogy": "Imagine trying to read a diary that's locked. Logical acquisition is like reading the diary when it's open, while physical acquisition is like trying to copy every page, even blank ones, from a closed diary. You can't read an open diary if it's slammed shut."

Physical acquisition, conversely, aims to create a complete, sector-by-sector image of the device's storage, including unallocated space where deleted data might reside. This bit-for-bit copy provides the most comprehensive data set but may still be encrypted, requiring further steps. Therefore, the scope and method of data extraction differ significantly.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Physical acquisition typically yields more data (including unallocated space) and can be slower. While unlocking is often needed for logical, physical methods aim for deeper access, potentially bypassing locks with specific tools. Both methods have varying capabilities for deleted data recovery depending on encryption and tool sophistication.",
