active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether iCloud backup forensics should prioritize legal compliance (e.g., warrants)
    over rapid acquisition in time-sensitive incident response scenarios. Support with examples of data synchronization pitfalls
    and tool limitations, referencing SWGDE best practices.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Forensics (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Digital Forensics > 009_Mobile Device
  Forensics > iOS Forensics > iCloud Backup Forensics).


  Generate 75 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet using the exact schema: FRONT (question), BACK with answer/explanation/distractors/source_links/active_element.


  Incorporate:

  - LEARNING OBJECTIVES: [paste the full array above].

  - SCAFFOLDING: [paste full scaffolding].

  - ACTIVE LEARNING TIES: Weave in discussion/peer/problem-solving hooks.

  - RESEARCH CONTEXT: iCloud backups (device snapshots, encrypted); vs. sync (Photos/Health real-time); acquisition needs
  Apple ID/password/2FA handling (app-specific passwords); tools: Elcomsoft Phone Breaker (download/parse backups, limitations:
  creds required, no device access); SWGDE best practices; prior: local iOS imaging.

  - BEST PRACTICES: Voter consensus - complete acquisition: 1. Obtain creds legally. 2. Use Elcomsoft: Login > Select backup
  > Download > Parse (handles 2FA via tokens). 3. Chain of custody. 4. Limitations: Rate limits, no encrypted key without
  device.


  Flashcards per schema/distractor protocol above. Ensure Bloom''s progression, misconceptions addressed, measurable outcomes.
