active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the advantages and risks of manual acquisition versus automated tools in mobile device forensics,
    considering scenarios like a live incident where the device is powered on and volatile data is at risk. Use NIST SP 800-86
    examples to support arguments, addressing misconceptions that manual methods are always inferior.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1. Common misconception (e.g., ''Manual acquisition always
    alters original data'' – wrong, if documented properly). 2. Confusable term (e.g., mix ADB with iTunes). 3. Extreme/overgeneralization
    (e.g., ''Never use manual on powered-on devices''). Ensure distractors test nuance from research context.'

  \ Manual acquisition involves direct examiner interaction with live mobile devices (e.g., ADB for Android, screen recording\
  \ for iOS) to capture volatile data without full automation. NIST SP 800-86: Details acquisition in IR, manual methods for\
  \ live systems ensure 'forensically sound' copies via hashing/documentation. SWGDE: Best practices stress isolation, verification.\
  \ Mobile specifics: Handle power-on state, authentication; risks include volatility loss. Sources: NIST SP 800-86 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-86.pdf),\
