      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Live acquisition is the most appropriate initial method because it allows for the capture of volatile data (RAM, network state) while the system is running, without immediately disrupting ongoing operations or evidence.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Physical acquisition requires downtime, logical acquisition misses volatile data, and standard file copy protocols may not ensure forensic integrity or capture all necessary volatile information.",
        "analogy": "It's like assessing a patient's vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure) immediately upon arrival at the ER, before performing more invasive tests."
