      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Cloud VMs operate in dynamic environments where instances can be automatically scaled, terminated, or reset. This inherent volatility means that attempting live acquisition (e.g., memory dumps) must be done quickly and carefully, as the underlying resources might disappear, leading to the loss of critical volatile evidence. Therefore, the risk of instance termination is a primary challenge.",

        "core_logic": "Data sovereignty refers to the principle that data is subject to the laws and regulations of the country in which it is collected, processed, or stored.

        "core_logic": "Cloud provider logging services are invaluable because they automatically record actions taken within the cloud environment, such as API calls, resource modifications, and access events. This provides a crucial, often immutable, audit trail that is essential for reconstructing events during an incident investigation.
