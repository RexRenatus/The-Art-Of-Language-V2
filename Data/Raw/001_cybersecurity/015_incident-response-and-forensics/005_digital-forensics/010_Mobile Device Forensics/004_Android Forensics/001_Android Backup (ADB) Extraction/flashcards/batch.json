      "correct_answer": "It serves as a valuable logical acquisition method, particularly useful when physical access or root is unavailable, but requires careful interpretation due to potential data inconsistencies.",

        {
          "text": "It is the gold standard for mobile forensics, providing complete and forensically sound physical images.",

          "text": "It is primarily used for user data backup and is not suitable for forensic investigations.",

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "ADB backup provides a practical logical acquisition method, especially when direct access is restricted. It's valuable because it leverages built-in device functions. However, examiners must understand its limitations, such as potential inconsistencies with database files and the exclusion of deleted data, therefore careful analysis is crucial.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The first distractor incorrectly equates ADB backup with physical imaging. The second dismisses its forensic value. The third falsely claims it recovers deleted data.",
        "analogy": "ADB backup is like a detailed inventory list provided by the owner of a house (the user). It's very useful for understanding what's there, but it might miss items in hidden drawers or things that were thrown away."
