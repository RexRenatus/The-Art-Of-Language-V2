        {
          "text": "These artifacts are always stored in a centralized, standardized location.",

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The challenge arises because each application functions as a distinct entity, often using its own methods and database structures to store browser-related artifacts. Therefore, forensic analysis requires understanding the specific implementation of each app's in-app browser.",

        "analogy": "Analyzing artifacts from different in-app browsers is like trying to read different types of diaries written in various languages and formats, rather than a single, standardized logbook."

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Logical acquisition works by leveraging the operating system's interfaces to request and copy specific files and data structures, including those containing browser artifacts.
