    devices during incident response. Consider legal admissibility, data minimization principles from GDPR/NIST, and real-world
    forensic scenarios.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (50% of cards): Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions:

    - Distractor 1: Superficially similar but incorrect (e.g., network AP log path instead of mobile artifact).

    - Distractor 2: Outdated/obsolete info (e.g., pre-Android 10 path).

    - Distractor 3: Confused platform (e.g., iOS path for Android question).

    Ensure one correct answer is obviously best when explained.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in mobile device forensics.
  Generate 25 high-quality Anki flashcards on ''Wi-Fi Connection History'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident
  Response And Forensics > Digital Forensics > 009_Mobile Device Forensics > Mobile Device Artifacts > Wi-Fi Connection History).
  Focus exclusively on mobile device artifacts (iOS: com.apple.wifi.plist, known networks; Android: wpa_supplicant.conf, WifiConfigStore.xml,
  /data/misc/wifi/), extraction (ADB, checkm8), analysis for IR, best practices (NIST SP 800-153, secure storage, chain of
  custody), per voter priorities on accuracy and completeness. Sources: NIST SP 800-153, NIST IR 8006, SANS FOR508, Magnet
  Forensics.


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list above].

  - Active Learning: Inspire cards that prep for discussion (privacy vs security), peer teaching (iOS vs Android), problem-solving
  (log analysis).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards: 25% Layer 1 (Foundation), 25% Layer 2 (Components), 25% Layer 3 (Implementation), 25% Layer
  4 (Integration).

  - Balance Bloom''s: 20% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 30% APPLY/ANALYZE, 30% EVALUATE, 20% CREATE.
