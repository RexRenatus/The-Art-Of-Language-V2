active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs of enabling full Script Block Logging (Event ID 4104) versus Module Logging (Event
    ID 4103) in a high-traffic enterprise environment. Under what scenarios would you disable certain logs for performance
    reasons, and how would you mitigate risks through alternatives like Transcription Logging or Protected Event Logging?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Block instead of Module), (2) Related but incorrect mechanism (e.g., ''Security log channel''), (3) Outdated/irrelevant
    (e.g., ''Event ID 4688 from process creation''). Ensure one distractor is a frequent real-world confusion (e.g., mixing
    Module vs. Script Block Logging).'

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema: {front, back, explanation, metadata}.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the full list above].

  - Active Learning: Weave in elements like discussion trade-offs, peer teaching steps, and problem-solving scenarios.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute across 4 layers [paste scaffolding details].

  - Voter Consensus: 70% approval; emphasize completeness on Script Block Logging (4104), Module Logging (4103), Transcription,
  Protected Event Logging; enabling/querying steps (GPO, Get-WinEvent); forensics exercises; sources (e.g., https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_logging_windows,
  https://adsecurity.org/?p=1513).


  Content Coverage: Definitions, Event IDs, enabling (e.g., GPO: Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates
  > Windows Components > Windows PowerShell > Turn on Module Logging/Script Block Logging), querying (Get-WinEvent -LogName
  ''Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational'' -FilterXPath ''*[System[EventID=4104]]''), analysis (IOCs in logs), trade-offs,
  policy design, SIEM integration.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly [paste schema]. Ensure distractors are educationally valuable. Output as a JSON array of
  objects. Balance Bloom''s levels and layers for progressive mastery.'
