  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the forensic value of quarantine attributes: How might adversaries evade
    detection by removing them (e.g., via `xattr -d`)? What countermeasures could investigators implement? Connect to real-world
    cases and MITRE ATT&CK techniques.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
