        "core_logic": "Security Associations (SAs) are fundamental to VPN security because they establish the agreed-upon rules for secure communication, including the encryption algorithms, hashing methods, and the keys used to protect the data. This works by negotiating these parameters upfront, ensuring both endpoints understand how to secure their communication.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly describe the purpose of SAs as credential encryption, traffic routing, or logging, rather than defining the security parameters for the tunnel.",
        "analogy": "An SA is like a pre-negotiated contract between two parties before they start a secure conversation, detailing exactly which secret codes (keys) and methods (algorithms) they will use to ensure privacy."
