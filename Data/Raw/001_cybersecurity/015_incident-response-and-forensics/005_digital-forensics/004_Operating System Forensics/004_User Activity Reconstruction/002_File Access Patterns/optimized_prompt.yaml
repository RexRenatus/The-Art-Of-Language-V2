active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, analyze how bulk file access patterns (e.g., rapid reads from sensitive directories)
    differ from normal user behavior and discuss their implications for data exfiltration or lateral movement in an incident
    response timeline. Use examples from Windows Event ID 4663 or Linux auditd logs to support your arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (2) Common misconception (e.g., normal vs. anomalous pattern swap), (3) Edge case or unrelated artifact (e.g., network
    log instead of file access). Ensure distractors test deeper understanding.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Digital Forensics. Generate
  25 high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards on ''File Access Patterns'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response
  And Forensics > Digital Forensics > 006_Operating System Forensics > User Activity Reconstruction > File Access Patterns).
  Integrate university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives [insert learning_objectives array here], active learning tie-ins
  [reference activities], and 4-layer scaffolding [insert scaffolding_layers here].


  Prior knowledge: File systems (FAT/NTFS), logging (event logs/audit trails), user permissions. Big picture: Enables timeline
  reconstruction for IR, detects data exfil/lateral movement. Key artifacts: Windows Event ID 4663 (object access), NTFS USN
  Journal, Linux auditd. Anomalies: Bulk access, sensitive files (e.g., credentials), unusual processes. Tools: Volatility,
  Autopsy. Frameworks: MITRE ATT&CK (e.g., T1003), NISTIR 8428 (cyber threat indicators for file behaviors).


  Use this schema [insert flashcard_schema here]. Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''Q&A|MCQ'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'':
  {...}, ''layer'': 1-4, ''bloom_level'': ''REMEMBER|etc.'', ''tags'': [''file-access'', ''forensics'']}, ...]. Ensure completeness,
  distractors challenge misconceptions, explanations scaffold learning and link to integration (e.g., IR workflows).'
