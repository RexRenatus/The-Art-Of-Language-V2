    mcq_distractors: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''User-space rootkits are
      harder to detect than kernel-space''); 2) Partial truths (e.g., mix up tools like ''Volatility for live scanning'');
      3) Edge cases (e.g., outdated techniques); 4) Voter-noted gaps (e.g., ignore firmware rootkits). Ensure one distractor
      is highly plausible to test analysis.'
    quantity_per_card: 20-30% of cards as MCQs; balance with Q&A/cloze.
    total_cards: Generate 50 high-quality flashcards covering all objectives, layers, and types.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Rootkit Detection (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Digital Forensics > 010_Malware Forensics > Malware Classification
  > Rootkit Detection). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning components, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard
  schema to create 50 optimized flashcards.


  Incorporate: Full coverage of rootkit types (user-mode, kernel-mode, application, firmware, boot, hypervisor); techniques
  (hooking, DKOM); detection methods (integrity checking/Tripwire, behavioral, memory forensics/Volatility, tools: GMER, RootkitRevealer,
  chkrootkit); live vs. offline analysis; prior links to malware classification.


  Sources: CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, arXiv papers on kernel rootkits.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as: {''front'': ''question'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
