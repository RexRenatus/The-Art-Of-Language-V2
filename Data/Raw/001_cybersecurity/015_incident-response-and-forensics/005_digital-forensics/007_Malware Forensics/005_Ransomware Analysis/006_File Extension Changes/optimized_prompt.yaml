  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use for scenario cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers (tag each: Layer1_Foundation, etc.). Big picture: Ransomware post-encryption
  (e.g., .wncry WannaCry, .locky Locky); MITRE ATT&CK T1036.007/.008; SWGDE metadata guidelines. Sources: attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/007,
  /008; DC0059.

  - Prior links: File systems, malware delivery.

  - Tools: exiftool, ''file'' command, Autopsy, Volatility/strings.

  - Concept map: Central ''File Extension Changes'' → Masquerading, Double Extensions, Metadata, MITRE T1036.
