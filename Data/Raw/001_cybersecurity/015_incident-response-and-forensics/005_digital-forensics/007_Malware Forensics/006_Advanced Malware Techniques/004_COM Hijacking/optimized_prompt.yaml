active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the relative risks of COM hijacking versus TypeLib abuse in enterprise
    environments. Consider factors like detection difficulty, privilege requirements, and impact on endpoint detection tools
    (e.g., EDR). Propose two mitigations and vote on the most effective.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Similar but incorrect registry path (e.g., Run key instead of InProcServer32), 3) Related technique (e.g., DLL side-loading
    path). Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter suggestions and research (e.g., mismatched TypeLib GUIDs).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Digital Forensics and Malware
  Forensics. Topic: COM Hijacking (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Digital Forensics > 010_Malware
  Forensics > 011_Advanced Malware Techniques > COM Hijacking). Consensus: 70% approval from 7 voters.


  Prior knowledge: Assume learners know Windows Registry, DLL loading, general malware persistence.

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert full scaffolding above]

  - Active Learning: Use concepts from activities to inspire scenario-based cards.


  Generate flashcards using EXACTLY this schema: [insert full flashcard_schema above].


  Content must be comprehensive: Cover CLSID/InProcServer32 hijacks, TypeLib abuse (HKCU\Software\Classes\TypeLib\{GUID},
  ''script:'' monikers), detection (Autoruns, RegRipper, Sysmon), mitigation, evasion, MITRE ATT&CK/LOLBAS refs. Ensure university-level
  accuracy, active recall, spaced repetition friendly.
