  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active learning tie-ins: Reference discussions, peer teaching, or exercises in explanations.

  - 4-Layer scaffolding: [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM ABOVE]. Map each card to a layer.

  - Voter consensus (82.9% approval): Emphasize Bloom''s progression, misconceptions (pseudonymity ≠ anonymity), case studies
  (Silk Road, WannaCry), best practices (multi-tool verification), big picture (80%+ crypto crimes), prerequisites (blockchain
  basics, DF principles).

  - Research context: Core concepts (transaction tracing, flow analysis, blockchain forensics); Tools (Blockpath, Chainalysis);
  Best practices (heuristics, chain of custody).


  Generate flashcards using this schema: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD_SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 75 flashcards,
  no additional text. Ensure high-quality: Active recall, spaced repetition friendly, distractors from pitfalls/misconceptions,
  explanations scaffolded with examples.'
