Therefore, understanding this difference guides evidence acquisition strategies.",

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Most cryptocurrency transactions are final and irreversible once confirmed on the blockchain. Coupled with the pseudonymous nature of wallet addresses, this makes direct recovery difficult because investigators must first definitively link the stolen funds to a specific wallet and then potentially pursue legal channels or trace funds to an entity that can be compelled to return them, since simply identifying the destination address doesn't guarantee fund retrieval.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Wallet software encryption is usually for private keys, not transaction history itself. Exchanges don't block recovery attempts; they might cooperate with legal requests. Blockchains are immutable, meaning historical data is reliable.",
