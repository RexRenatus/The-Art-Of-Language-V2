  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the ethical implications of anonymous communication tools in digital forensics: Do they primarily
    protect legitimate privacy (e.g., whistleblowers) or enable crime (e.g., Dark Web markets)? Support with examples like
    Tor usage in high-profile cases and reference NIST frameworks on evidence preservation.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Digital Forensics: Dark
  Web and Anonymity Forensics. Topic: ''Anonymous Communication Tools'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response
  And Forensics > Digital Forensics > 012_Specialized Forensics Domains > Dark Web and Anonymity Forensics > Anonymous Communication
  Tools).


  Incorporate:

  - Research: Core concepts (anonymity, pseudonymity, obfuscation, circumvention); Tools (Tor onion routing, I2P mixnets,
  VPNs, Freenet); Forensics (endpoint artifacts, traffic analysis, correlation attacks); NIST SP 800-86 (evidence preservation
  in IR).

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE].

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE] – reference in explanations.

  - Scaffolding: Strictly cover 4 layers [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE]; use hierarchical concept map.

  - Prior knowledge: Assume TCP/IP, basic DF.


  Generate flashcards per EXACT schema [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD_SCHEMA]. Ensure university pedagogy: Bloom''s progression, active
  recall, spaced repetition. Cards must be precise, forensic-focused, no illegal advice. Output ONLY the JSON array of 30
  flashcards.'
