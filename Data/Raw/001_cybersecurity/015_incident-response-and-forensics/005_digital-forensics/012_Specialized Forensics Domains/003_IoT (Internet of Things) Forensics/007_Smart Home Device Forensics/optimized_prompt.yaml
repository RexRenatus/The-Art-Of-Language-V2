    rules:
    - 'Distractors must be plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., for ''data volatility'': distractors like ''permanent
      storage failure'' vs. correct ''ephemeral memory loss'').'
    - Draw from research context/challenges (e.g., confuse encryption with hashing).
    - 'Vary: 1 near-miss (similar term), 1 opposite, 1 unrelated but topic-adjacent.'
    - Randomize order; include 'Explanation of why distractors are wrong' in back.
    ratio: 30% basic, 40% cloze, 30% MCQ; balance across Bloom's/scaffolding.

  Voter consensus: 82.9% approval on pedagogy, completeness, engagement.


  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives** (span Bloom''s): [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - **Active Learning** (for context/depth): [INSERT FULL ACTIVE LEARNING FROM ABOVE]

  - **Scaffolding Content** (build cards progressively): [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM ABOVE]

  - **Research Context**: Use provided summary on core concepts, challenges (volatility, heterogeneity, encryption), tools
  (Wireshark, Binwalk), processes (triage, acquisition), cases (Mirai, Ring).


  **Output Format**: JSON array of objects, each with: {"type": "basic|cloze_deletion|mcq", "front": "...", "back": "...",
  "explanation": "...", "bloom_level": "...", "scaffolding_layer": "...", "tags": ["..."], "difficulty": "easy|medium|hard"}.
  For MCQ: front lists options A-D (random order), back reveals correct + distractor explanations.


  **Generation Guidelines**:

  - Cover all objectives/layers evenly (aim 8-15 cards per Bloom''s level, 12-25 per layer).

  - Use flashcard schema: [INSERT FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE], including distractor protocol.

  - Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition, higher-order thinking.

  - Cards must be concise (front <100 words), accurate, evidence-based.

  - Promote integration: e.g., cards linking challenges to tools/processes.
