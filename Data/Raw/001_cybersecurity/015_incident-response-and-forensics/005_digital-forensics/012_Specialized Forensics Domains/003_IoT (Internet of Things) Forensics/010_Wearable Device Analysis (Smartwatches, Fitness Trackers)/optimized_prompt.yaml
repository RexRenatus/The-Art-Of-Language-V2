active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between user privacy (e.g., location and health data in
    fitness trackers) and security requirements for first responders using wearables. Reference NISTIR 8196 threat models
    and justify positions with real-world examples from breaches like Fitbit data leaks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [REMEMBER: Define key terms... ] (use all 6, balance coverage across 20-30 flashcards).

  - Scaffolding: Generate flashcards progressively: 30% Layer 1 (Foundation), 25% Layer 2 (Components), 25% Layer 3 (Implementation),
  20% Layer 4 (Integration). Tag each with layer.

  - Active Learning: Infuse prompts tying to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving (e.g., ''Apply in scenario...'').

  - Prior Knowledge: Link to digital forensics basics, mobile IR.

  - Best Practices: NISTIR 8196 (threat models, security objectives for wearables in public safety), NISTIR 8235 (procurement,
  risk assessments, forensic methods like imaging/chain of custody). Sources: NISTIR 8196 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8196),
  NISTIR 8235 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8235).
