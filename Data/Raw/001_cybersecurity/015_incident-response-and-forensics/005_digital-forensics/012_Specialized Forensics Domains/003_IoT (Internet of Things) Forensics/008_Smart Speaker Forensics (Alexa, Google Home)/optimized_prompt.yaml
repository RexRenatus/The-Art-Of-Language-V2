active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a forensic investigation involving a homicide where an Alexa device recorded suspicious voice commands,
    debate the balance between privacy rights (e.g., warrant requirements for cloud data) and the evidentiary value of smart
    speaker logs. Support arguments with references to NIST SP 800-86 and ethical considerations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    local data'' vs. cloud), (2) Related but incorrect term (e.g., ''firewall logs'' instead of ''device logs''), (3) Partial
    truth exaggerated (e.g., ''Always power off device first'' ignoring live acquisition risks). Ensure one correct answer
    clearly superior; avoid ''all/none'' options.'

  Incorporate these elements:

  - LEARNING OBJECTIVES: [paste the array above].

  - SCAFFOLDING LAYERS: [paste scaffolding object above] – ensure coverage across 4 layers.

  - ACTIVE LEARNING TIES: Reference discussion/activities in explanations where relevant.

  - RESEARCH CONTEXT: Ground in core concepts (smart speakers, IoT forensics, cloud/local data, voice commands, device logs,
  anti-forensics); standards (NIST SP 800-86, NISTIR 8259, ENISA IoT guidelines, SWGDE best practices for imaging/chain of
  custody).

  - BEST PRACTICES: Use Bloom''s Taxonomy progression; active recall; spaced repetition friendly.
