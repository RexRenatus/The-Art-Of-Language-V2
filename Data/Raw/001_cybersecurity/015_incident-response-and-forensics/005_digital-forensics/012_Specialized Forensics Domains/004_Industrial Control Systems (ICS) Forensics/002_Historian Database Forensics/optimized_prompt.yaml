active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the unique forensic challenges of historian databases in ICS/OT versus traditional IT databases,
    considering factors like legacy systems, proprietary protocols, and potential physical consequences of incidents. Propose
    2-3 mitigation strategies and real-world examples such as Stuxnet-like attacks.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains time-series data forensics in historian databases (e.g., detecting gaps, manipulations,
    or anomalies using tools like OSIsoft PI), while the partner teaches back the concept by creating a simple diagram or
    flowchart of the data flow and forensic process.
  problem_solving: Given a mock historian database dataset with anomalies (e.g., unnatural sensor spikes at irregular timestamps,
    data gaps during a suspected attack), students analyze it step-by-step to identify tampering evidence, reconstruct a timeline,
    and recommend incident response actions. Discuss findings in a think-pair-share format.

    modern), time-series with relational DBs, or DFIR with general IT forensics. Ensure 1-2 distractors are ''near misses''
    (e.g., valid in IT but not OT), avoiding obvious errors. Rotate formats: 40% cloze, 30% short answer, 30% MCQ.'
