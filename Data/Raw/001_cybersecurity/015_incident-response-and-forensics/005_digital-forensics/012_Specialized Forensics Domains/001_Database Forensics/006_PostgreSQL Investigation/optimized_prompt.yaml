active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the forensic advantages of PITR over SQL Dump backups in a PostgreSQL breach
    scenario. How does WAL analysis reveal attacker timelines that other methods miss? Reference NIST SP 800-61 phases to
    justify your position.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 1. Similar terms (e.g., WAL vs. pg_log).
    - 2. Partial truths (e.g., PITR enables point-in-time but distractor says 'full restore only').
    - 3. Common misconceptions (e.g., SQL Dump is always forensically complete → No, lacks WAL).
    - 4. NIST phase swaps (e.g., confuse Containment with Eradication).
    - 5. Tool mismatches (e.g., Autopsy for WAL → No, use pg_waldump).
    mcq_format: 4 options (1 correct, labeled A-D), bold correct in explanation.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, particularly Digital Forensics
  (Domain: 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 012_Specialized Forensics Domains > Database Forensics > PostgreSQL Investigation).
  Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, 4-layer scaffolding. Topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident
