active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In groups, discuss real-world scenarios where RDP was abused for lateral movement (e.g., via jump hosts).
    Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of common detection methods like Event ID monitoring versus behavioral analytics.
    Share one mitigation strategy and justify its effectiveness.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
