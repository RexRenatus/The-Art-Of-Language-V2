active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a live incident response scenario where stealth is critical (e.g., active breach), debate the advantages
    and limitations of using tcpdump over graphical tools like Wireshark. Consider factors like resource usage, detectability
    on compromised systems, output interpretability, and alignment with NIST SP 800-61 evidence collection.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., ''tcpdump uses Wireshark engine'' instead of libpcap); 3) Edge cases (e.g., wrong protocol in filter like ''port
    80 tcp'' vs ''port 80''). Ensure distractors test subtle understanding, not trivia.'

  Generate 20-30 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet using university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (cover all
  levels via provided objectives), active learning (infuse discussion/peer/problem-solving contexts), scaffolding layers (5
  cards per layer), and voter consensus (82.9% approval: concrete commands like ''tcpdump -i eth0 port 80 -w capture.pcap'',
  output snippets, best practices incl. privilege dropping/rotation/secure storage).


  **Learning Objectives (span REMEMBER to CREATE):** [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  **Active Learning Contexts:** [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE] – Weave into explanations.

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE] – Distribute cards evenly.

  **Research Context:** tcpdump uses libpcap for capture; aligns with NIST SP 800-61 (incident handling via traffic analysis);
  best practices: root init then drop privileges, -C/-G for rotation.


  **Output Format:** JSON array of objects: [{''type'': ''Q&A|MCQ|Cloze'', ''bloom_level'': ''APPLY'', ''layer'': 3, ''front'':
  ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''options'': [...] if MCQ, ''correct'': ''A'' if MCQ, ''explanation'': ''...'', ''tags'': [''DDoS
  scenario'', ''BPF filter''] }]. Follow exact flashcard_schema: balanced formats, distractor protocol (plausible errors),
  detailed explanations.


  Ensure hands-on focus: Include real commands/outputs (e.g., ''12:34:56.789012 IP 192.168.1.1.12345 > 8.8.8.8.53: UDP''),
  forensics scenarios, no fluff. Prioritize voter priorities: pedagogy (MCQs on syntax/scenarios), completeness (full best
  practices).'
