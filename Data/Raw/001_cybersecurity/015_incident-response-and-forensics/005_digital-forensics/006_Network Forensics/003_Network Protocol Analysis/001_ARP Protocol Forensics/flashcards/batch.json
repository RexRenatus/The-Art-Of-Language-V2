ARP's statelessness means it doesn't verify if an incoming ARP reply corresponds to a prior request, allowing attackers to send unsolicited, false replies that are readily accepted and poison the ARP cache [blog.lastpass.com].",
        "distractor_analysis": "Statelessness does not mean no logging, encryption, or guaranteed correct responses; it refers to the lack of session state tracking.",
        "analogy": "A stateless protocol is like a vending machine that accepts any coin without remembering if you've already made a purchase; an attacker can keep inserting 'coins' (fake ARP replies) without the machine checking its history."
