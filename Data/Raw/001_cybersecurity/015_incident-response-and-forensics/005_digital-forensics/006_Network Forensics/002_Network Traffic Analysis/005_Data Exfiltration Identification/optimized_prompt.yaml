active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the relative detectability of MITRE ATT&CK exfiltration techniques T1048 (Exfiltration Over Alternative
    Protocol) vs. T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) in a typical enterprise network. Reference tools like Wireshark, real-world
    cases (e.g., NCSC guidance), and address misconceptions that exfiltration always involves high-volume transfers.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    must be web-grounded (e.g., from MITRE, NCSC) and include one ''near-miss'' (similar technique) and one ''obvious wrong''

  **Research Context:** Data exfiltration is unauthorized data transfer from networks/systems [cyber.gc.ca, ncsc.gov.uk].
  Key concepts: malicious insiders, insider risk frameworks. MITRE ATT&CK: T1048 (Alternative Protocol, e.g., DNS tunneling),
  T1041 (C2 Channel), T1052 (Physical). Treat as data breach triggering IR [NCSC/Canadian Centre]. Tools: Wireshark for anomalous
  traffic (SMB, HTTP POSTs).
