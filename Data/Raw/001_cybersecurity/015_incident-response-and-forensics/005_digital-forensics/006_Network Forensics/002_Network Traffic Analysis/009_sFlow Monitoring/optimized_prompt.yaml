active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare sFlow and NetFlow for network forensics in incident response. Debate pros/cons regarding sampling
    accuracy (sFlow's fixed-rate vs. NetFlow's adaptive), overhead, and anomaly detection in high-speed networks experiencing
    a potential DDoS attack. Consider prior knowledge of IP packets and UDP.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    1 related but wrong concept (e.g., NetFlow caching vs. sFlow sampling), 1 edge case reversal (e.g., agent receives instead
    of sends). Ensure explanations educate on errors. Balance across Bloom''s levels and layers.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Network Forensics. Generate
  high-quality Anki-style flashcards for the topic ''sFlow Monitoring'' in the hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response
  And Forensics > Digital Forensics > 008_Network Forensics > Network Traffic Analysis > sFlow Monitoring.


  Big Picture Context: sFlow is a scalable, sampled flow protocol for high-speed network visibility, ideal for incident response/forensics
  as an alternative to resource-intensive full PCAP, enabling anomaly detection (e.g., DDoS, exfiltration via egress monitoring).


  Incorporate these exact elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE THE learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]

  - Active Learning: Use concepts from discussion (sFlow vs NetFlow), peer teaching (agent-collector), problem-solving (datagram
  analysis).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers: [PASTE THE scaffolding ARRAY HERE]

  - Prior Knowledge: Link to IP/UDP packets, NetFlow, SNMP.

  - Research: Flow (IP packets sharing headers), Flow Record, Agent (samples/exports datagrams), Collector (analyzes), Data
  Sources (interfaces, esp. Egress for outbound forensics).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 24-36 flashcards, each matching this EXACT schema: [PASTE THE flashcard_schema structure HERE].


  Ensure: Exactly 3 distractors per card with text/explanation; validate bloom_level enum; cover all objectives/layers; questions
  promote active recall (e.g., ''What is...'', ''How does...'', ''Analyze this scenario...''); explanations tie to pedagogy
  (e.g., ''This tests ANALYZE level by...''). No additional text.'
