active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between statistical beaconing detection methods (e.g., packet
    size entropy) and machine learning approaches. Consider factors like false positives in high-traffic enterprise networks,
    computational overhead, and evasion techniques used by advanced persistent threats (APTs). Support arguments with examples
    from MITRE ATT&CK C2 tactics.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    exfiltration packets'' vs. small beacons); 2) Confusable term (e.g., ''DGA'' mixed with ''DNS tunneling''); 3) Edge case/error
    (e.g., legitimate traffic pattern like NTP). Ensure distractors test nuance without being obviously wrong. Balance 60%
    basic recall cards, 40% application/analysis.'
