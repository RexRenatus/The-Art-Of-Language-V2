        "core_logic": "NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 emphasizes a structured incident response process. After detection, the crucial step is analysis and validation because acting prematurely (isolation) or incorrectly (deletion, dismissal) can lead to operational disruption, loss of evidence, or missed threats.",

        "analogy": "If your car's 'check engine' light comes on (anomaly detected), you don't immediately drive it into a ditch (isolate). You take it to a mechanic to diagnose the problem (analyze and validate) before deciding on the next step."
