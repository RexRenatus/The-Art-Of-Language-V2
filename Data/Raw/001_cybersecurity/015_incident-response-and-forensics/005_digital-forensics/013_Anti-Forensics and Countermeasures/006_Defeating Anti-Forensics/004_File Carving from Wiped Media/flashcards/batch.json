      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Deleted file recovery leverages the file system's index (e.g., MFT, inodes) to find entries for deleted files. File carving bypasses the file system entirely, searching the raw data for file headers and footers, making it suitable for wiped or corrupted file systems.",
