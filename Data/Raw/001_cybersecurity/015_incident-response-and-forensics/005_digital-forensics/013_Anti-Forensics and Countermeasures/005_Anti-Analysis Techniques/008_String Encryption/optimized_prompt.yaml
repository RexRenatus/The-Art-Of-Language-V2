  discussion_prompt: In a small group, debate the ethical implications of attackers using string encryption to hide IOCs in
    malware. How does it challenge forensic investigators, and what countermeasures (e.g., behavioral analysis) would you
    propose? Support with NIST SP 800-57 key management references.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate:

  - Research: String encryption transforms plaintext to ciphertext via algorithm + key (NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 Rev. 5: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/57/pt1/r5/final;
  Part 2 for org practices). Anti-forensics: Obfuscates malware strings.

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM JSON ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL LAYERS FROM JSON ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to activities (e.g., ''Apply to peer teaching XOR demo'').

  - Prior knowledge: Programming strings, basic crypto.


  Output exactly 50 flashcards in JSON array: [{''id'':1, ''type'':''MCQ/Definition/etc.'', ''bloom_level'':''REMEMBER'',
  ''layer'':1, ''front'':''Question text'', ''back'':{''answer'':''...'', ''explanation'':''...'', ''context'':''...'', ''reference'':''...'',
  ''misconception'':''...''}}, ...]. Follow flashcard_schema strictly: Varied types, distractors per protocol (encryption
  vs encoding, key importance, anti-forensics focus). Ensure measurable verbs, anti-forensics specificity, progressive difficulty.
  No duplicates; cover hierarchy.'
