active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a SaaS data breach affecting users in the EU, US, and Asia (e.g., similar to the Capital One AWS S3
    breach), debate which jurisdiction should prevail for forensic investigations, considering data localization laws, GDPR
    extraterritorial reach, and the CLOUD Act. Support arguments with evidence from cloud provider terms and regulations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    location''); 2) Partial truth (e.g., mixes IaaS/PaaS responsibilities); 3) Edge case reversal (e.g., ignores Schrems II
    for EU data). Ensure distractors test nuance in cloud models/jurisdictions.'

  - Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL 4 LAYERS FROM ABOVE]

  - Concept Map: Central ''Jurisdiction & Legal Issues'' → Branches: ''Multi-Jurisdictional Challenges (Cloud Data Flows:
  IaaS/PaaS/SaaS)'', ''Evidence Admissibility'', ''Regulations (GDPR, CCPA, CLOUD Act, Schrems II, HIPAA, data localization)'',
  Dependencies: NIST SP 800-61 IR, Forensics Processes.

  - Research Context: Jurisdiction complexities in borderless cloud (data sovereignty, cross-border flows); Key regs: GDPR
  (EU rights/transfers), CCPA (CA privacy), CLOUD Act (US access abroad), Schrems II (EU-US adequacy), HIPAA (health), localization
  laws; NIST 800-61 for IR integration; Examples: Capital One AWS breach.
