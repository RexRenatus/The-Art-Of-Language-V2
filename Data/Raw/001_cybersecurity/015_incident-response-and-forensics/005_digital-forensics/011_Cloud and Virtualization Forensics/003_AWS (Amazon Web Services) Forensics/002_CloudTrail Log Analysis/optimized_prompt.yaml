active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given a CloudTrail log showing unusual API calls from an unknown IP, debate the trade-offs between enabling
    comprehensive data event logging for better forensics versus increased storage costs and privacy concerns. How does this
    align with NIST CSF Detect and Respond functions?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Base on common misconceptions: e.g., ''Data events are enabled by default'' (wrong: opt-in); ''Event History covers
      data events'' (wrong: management only); ''CloudTrail logs all AWS services equally'' (wrong: service-specific).'
    - 'Use partial truths: e.g., for Insights, distractor ''Logs data events'' vs. correct ''Analyzes management events for
      anomalies''.'
    - 'Real-world errors: Confuse IP with userAgent; assume 90-day limit for Trails.'
    - 'Plausible alternatives from research: e.g., S3 vs. CloudWatch delivery.'
    - 'Avoid randomness: Each distractor teaches (e.g., ''Costs too high for management events only'').'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in AWS Forensics. Topic: CloudTrail
  Log Analysis (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Digital Forensics > 011_Cloud and Virtualization
  Forensics > AWS Forensics > CloudTrail Log Analysis).


  Core Content (from AWS docs): CloudTrail records API activity as events (management: control plane e.g. CreateBucket; data:
  data plane e.g. GetObject, opt-in; Insights: anomaly detection). Event History: 90-day management view. Trails: Deliver
  logs to S3/etc. Analysis: Athena queries, anomaly detection (unusual IP/API errors), integrity via digests. Integrates with
  NIST IR (Preparation-Detection-Analysis).

  Learning Objectives: [Insert full learning_objectives array here]. Strictly align 1+ cards per objective.


  Active Learning Tie-ins: Reference discussion/peer/problem-solving in explanations.


  Generate flashcards per EXACT schema: [Insert full flashcard_schema JSON here]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards,
  each as {''front'': {...}, ''back'': {...}}. Ensure 40-60 cards, high-quality, no duplicates, optimized for Anki/Quizlet
  (spaced repetition via progressive difficulty). Distractors MUST follow protocol. Vary question types. Prerequisites: Note
  basic AWS/IAM/IR knowledge.


  Big Picture: Emphasize forensics value in cloud IR.'
