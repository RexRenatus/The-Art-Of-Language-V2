  Core Knowledge (synthesized from research, voter consensus, and completions):

  - Azure Blob Storage: Scalable object storage for unstructured data (AI, backups); types: Block (general), Append (logs),
  Page (VM disks); tiers: Hot/Cool/Archive.

  - Forensics: Logs (Storage Analytics, diagnostic, access); features: versioning, immutability.

  - Shared Responsibility: Microsoft secures infrastructure; customer handles configs/logs.

  - Frameworks: MITRE ATT&CK (T1078 Valid Accounts, T1567 Exfiltration Over C2), NIST SP 800-61 IR phases, Azure Security
  Baseline (logging mandates).

  - Procedures: Enable diagnostics, query Log Analytics, preserve chain of custody.

  - Tools/Integrations: Azure Sentinel, Defender for Cloud.

  - Cases: Capital One (misconfig), SolarWinds (exfil).

  - Prior: Builds on NIST IR, digital forensics principles.
