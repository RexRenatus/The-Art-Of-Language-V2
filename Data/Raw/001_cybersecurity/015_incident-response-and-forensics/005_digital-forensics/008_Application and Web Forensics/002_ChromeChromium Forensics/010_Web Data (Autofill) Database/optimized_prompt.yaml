active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of autofill convenience versus security risks. In groups, categorize risks by data
    type (e.g., contact vs. payment info), compare implementations across browsers (Chrome vs. Firefox), and propose policy
    changes aligned with NIST SP 800-63B guidelines for digital identity security.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs based on common misconceptions (e.g., wrong file path like 'User Data/WebData'
      without 'Default'; similar tables like 'history' instead of 'autofill'; incorrect OS paths).
    - 'Distractors must be realistic: e.g., Linux path as Windows variant; credit_cards table confused with autofill; WebKit
      timestamps as Unix epoch.'
    - Ensure 1 highly plausible (near-miss), 1 conceptual error, 1 unrelated but similar term.
    - 'Balance difficulty: 70% Layer 1-2 (recall/understand), 30% Layer 3-4 (apply/analyze/evaluate).'
    quantity: 'Generate 50-75 flashcards total: 20% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 20% Evaluate/Create, 30% mixed.'

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives: [insert full learning_objectives array here].

  - Active learning for context: [insert active_learning object here] – reference in explanations to encourage application.

  - 4-Layer Scaffolding: [insert scaffolding array here] – tag each card with layer.

  - Research context: Chrome Web Data DB at %LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Web Data (adapt for OS); SQLite
  tables (autofill: name,value,date_last_used; credit_cards; autofill_metadata); timestamps (WebKit); tools (Autopsy, sqlite3,
  DB Browser); best practices (hashing, NIST SP 800-63B for identity risks); security risks (PII exposure).


  Generate 50-75 Anki-compatible flashcards following this schema: [insert flashcard_schema here]. Output as a JSON array
  of objects, each with ''front'', ''back'' (nested object with answer, explanation, bloom_level, scaffolding_layer, source),
  and ''type'' (Basic Q&A, MCQ, Cloze, Scenario). Ensure variety, high fidelity to facts, and distractors per protocol. Prioritize
  university-level rigor with active recall and spaced repetition optimization.'
