active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the forensic reliability of Chrome Media History compared to full browser
    History DB in cases of media-based phishing attacks. Support your arguments with references to NIST SP 800-61 and common
    anti-forensic techniques like browser cache clearing.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    instead of History DB), 2) Related but incorrect artifact (e.g., ''Firefox places.sqlite''), 3) Partial truth (e.g., ''Windows
    path: Program Files/Chrome''). Ensure distractors test deeper understanding without being obvious.'

  Use web-grounded context: Chrome Media History tracks media (video/audio) via History.db (visits/downloads tables, media
  MIME), Cache/, paths per OS; tools like Autopsy/Plaso; NIST SP 800-61; SWGDE browser forensics guidelines.
