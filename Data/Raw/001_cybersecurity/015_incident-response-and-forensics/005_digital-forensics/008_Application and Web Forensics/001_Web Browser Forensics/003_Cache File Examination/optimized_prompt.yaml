active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a corporate espionage case, how might browser cache files (e.g., Chrome Cache remnants) reveal unauthorized
    data exfiltration? Debate the evidentiary weight of cache artifacts versus system logs, considering volatility and anti-forensic
    tampering.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
