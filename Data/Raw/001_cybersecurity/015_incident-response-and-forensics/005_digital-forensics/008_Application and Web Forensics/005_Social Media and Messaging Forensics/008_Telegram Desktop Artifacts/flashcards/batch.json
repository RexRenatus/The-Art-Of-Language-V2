        "core_logic": "Telegram's cloud storage means that standard chat data resides on both the client and server, providing multiple avenues for acquisition: local device artifacts and, potentially, server-side data through legal channels or DFIR tools, because the platform synchronizes data across devices via its cloud.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly claim data is only local, require MITM attacks, or assume a fixed server deletion policy, all of which misrepresent the implications of Telegram's cloud-based architecture for standard chats.",
        "analogy": "Telegram's cloud storage is like having your emails accessible from any device; the messages exist both on your computer (local artifact) and on the email provider's server (server-side data)."
