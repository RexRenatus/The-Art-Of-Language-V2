active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical and legal challenges of using publicly available Twitter/X
    data in forensics (e.g., privacy vs. public interest). Support arguments with references to OSINT/SOCMINT principles and
    real-world cases from sources like Pagefreezer blog.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MC card: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Use MD5 hashing'' instead
    of SHA-256), 2) Related but incorrect term (e.g., ''OSINT'' vs. ''SOCMINT''), 3) Partial truth (e.g., ''Screenshots only,
    no hashing needed''). Ensure distractors test nuance without misleading.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Digital Forensics (Domain:

  Generate 25-30 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet, covering all Bloom''s levels and scaffolding layers.
  Integrate research: OSINT/SOCMINT (blog.pagefreezer.com), NIST CSF 2.0/SP 800-61 (csrc.nist.gov), best practices (evidence
  collection via Twarc/Pagefreezer/API/screenshots, preservation with SHA-256 hashing, chain of custody).

  Active Learning tie-ins where relevant.


  Strictly follow flashcard_schema:

  [Insert full flashcard_schema here].


  Distribute cards: 30% Layer 1 (Remember/Understand), 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3 (Apply/Analyze), 20% Layer 4 (Evaluate/Create).
  Vary types: 40% MC, 30% Q&A, 30% Cloze. Ensure completeness (e.g., full best practices steps), pedagogy (action verbs),
  and voter consensus (70% approval).


  Output format: JSON array of objects, each: {''front'': ''question'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': #, ''objective_id'': #, ''source'': ''...''}}. No extra text.'
