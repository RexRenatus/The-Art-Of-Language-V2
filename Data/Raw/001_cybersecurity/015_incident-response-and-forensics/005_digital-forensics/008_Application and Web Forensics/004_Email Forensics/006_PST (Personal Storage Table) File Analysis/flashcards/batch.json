        "core_logic": "The core difference lies in their synchronization purpose: OST files are dynamically linked to servers for offline access, reflecting server changes, because they are designed for connected services, whereas PST files are generally static archives or for disconnected POP accounts.",
        "distractor_analysis": "PSTs are not typically for active server sync. OSTs are not strictly read-only. The account associations are reversed in the distractor. PSTs do not perform real-time sync.",
        "analogy": "An OST file is like a live mirror of a cloud document, allowing you to work offline but keeping it updated when you reconnect. A PST file is more like a saved copy of a document from a specific point in time."
