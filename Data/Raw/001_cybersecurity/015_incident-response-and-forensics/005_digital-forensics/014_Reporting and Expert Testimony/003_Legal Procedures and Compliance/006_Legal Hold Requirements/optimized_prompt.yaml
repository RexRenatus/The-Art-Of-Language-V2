active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the exact moment when 'reasonable anticipation of litigation' is triggered in a cybersecurity
    incident response. Provide examples from real breaches (e.g., Equifax data breach) and argue for/against early vs. late
    holds, considering risks like spoliation sanctions. Reference Sedona Conference guidelines and Zubulake v. UBS Warburg.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
