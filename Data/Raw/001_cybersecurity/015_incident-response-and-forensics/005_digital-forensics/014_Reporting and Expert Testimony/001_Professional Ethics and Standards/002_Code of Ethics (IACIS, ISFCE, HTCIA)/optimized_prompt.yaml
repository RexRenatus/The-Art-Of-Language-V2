  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Loyalty to employer
    overrides objectivity''); 2) Similar but incorrect principles (e.g., confuse IACIS integrity with ISFCE reporting); 3)
    Edge cases or outdated views (e.g., ''Confidentiality only for clients, not law enforcement''). Ensure distractors promote
    critical thinking and relate to voter-identified themes like ethical dilemmas.'

  Topic: ''Code of Ethics (IACIS, ISFCE, HTCIA)'' in hierarchy: Cybersecurity (Level1) > 002_Incident Response And Forensics
  (Level2) > Digital Forensics (Level3) > 014_Reporting and Expert Testimony (Level4) > Professional Ethics and Standards
  (Level5) > Code of Ethics (IACIS, ISFCE, HTCIA) (Level6). Voter consensus (67.1% approval): Prioritize completeness on IACIS,
  ISFCE, HTCIA (replace/supplement any DFCB mentions); pedagogy via Bloom''s progression, active learning, 4-layer scaffolding.


  Content Guidelines: Base on official sources (e.g., IACIS 10 principles: competence, integrity; ISFCE: truthfulness, impartiality;
  HTCIA: integrity, confidentiality, cooperation). Key concepts: integrity, objectivity, professionalism, confidentiality,
  competence, accountability. Include enforcement (certification revocation). Research context: Emphasize trust in forensics;
  complete with HTCIA details.
