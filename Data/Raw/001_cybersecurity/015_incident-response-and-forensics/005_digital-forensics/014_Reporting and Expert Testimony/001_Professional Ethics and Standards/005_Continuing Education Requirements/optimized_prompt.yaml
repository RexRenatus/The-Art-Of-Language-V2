  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the ethics: Should courts require proof of recent continuing education (e.g., within the last
    3 years) for digital forensics experts providing testimony? Cite supporting standards like NIST NICE Framework, IACIS
    ethics codes, and Daubert standards. Discuss potential consequences of non-compliance, such as case dismissals or expert
    disqualification.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Expanded Research Context** (complete and web-grounded):

  Continuing Education (CE) is mandatory for digital forensics experts to maintain certifications, ethics, and testimony admissibility
  amid evolving threats. Key certifications: GCFA/GCFE (GIAC: 36 CPEs/3 years), EnCE (60 CPEs/3 years), CCE (similar), CISSP
  ((ISC)^2: 120 CPEs/3 years). Ethics boards like IACIS mandate CE. NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 guides incident response; NIST SP
  800-181 (NICE Framework) defines roles like FOR-001 Digital Forensics Analyst requiring lifelong learning. Testimony standards:
  Daubert (reliability), ASTM E444 (evidence reports). CE types: courses, webinars (1 CPE/hour), conferences. Track via GIAC
  CE Portal, (ISC)^2 dashboard; audits random. Sources: NIST SP 800-61 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/61/r3/final), SP
  800-181 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/181/r1/final), GIAC (https://www.giac.org/continuing-education/), (ISC)^2 (https://www.isc2.org/register-for-exam),
  IACIS (https://www.iacis.com/certifications/).


  **Learning Objectives** (cover evenly): [insert the 6 objectives above].

  **Scaffolding Layers** (distribute flashcards): [insert the 4 layers above].

  **Active Learning Ties**: Reference where relevant (e.g., ''Links to debate on court CE proof'').


  **Generation Rules**:

  - Strictly follow flashcard_schema: JSON output only.

  - Ensure spaced repetition: reverse cards where possible.

  - Balance: 1/6 per objective, 1/4 per layer.

  - Distractors per protocol.

  - Pedagogically optimized: Promote active recall, link to real-world forensics.


  **Output Format**: JSON array of 50 objects, e.g. [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''references'': [...]}, ''metadata'': {...}}]. No extra text.'
