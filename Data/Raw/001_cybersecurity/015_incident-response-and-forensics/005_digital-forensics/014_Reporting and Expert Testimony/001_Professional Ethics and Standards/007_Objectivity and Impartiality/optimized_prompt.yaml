  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema provided. Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives (span Bloom''s: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create).

  - Scaffolding layers (Layer 1: Foundation defs/prereqs; Layer 2: NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 (2008), SP 800-86 (2006) components;
  Layer 3: Implementation steps/example; Layer 4: Daubert/ASCLD/SWGDE integration).

  - Active learning ties (e.g., reference mock report revision).

  - Voter priorities: Accuracy (Rev. 2 only, complete 800-86: forensic integration for objective mapping), completeness (full
  sources: csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/61/r2/final, csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/86/final), pedagogy (measurable, progressive).

  - Web context: Objectivity (fact-based, no bias), Impartiality (fair evidence treatment); big picture (court admissibility,
  trust).


  Use schema: Front (Q), Back (answer+explanation+Bloom+layer+tie), distractors for MCQs (3 plausible errors). Balance types/levels/layers.
  Output ONLY JSON array.'
