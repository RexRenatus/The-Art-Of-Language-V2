active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how inaccurate or incomplete time and billing records could jeopardize
    the chain of custody in a digital forensics case and affect expert testimony admissibility under standards like Daubert
    or NIST SP 800-61. Provide real-world examples from cybersecurity incidents.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Plausible but incorrect: Based on common pitfalls (e.g., ''Vague task descriptions are acceptable'' vs. detailed logging
      required)'
    - 'Misconception-based: Confuse with non-forensic billing (e.g., ''Only billable hours matter, not chain of custody'')'
    - 'Partial truth: Close but incomplete (e.g., ''Log time per NIST SP 800-53'' instead of 800-61)'
    - 'Edge case reversal: Invert best practice (e.g., ''Omit timestamps if internal use'')'

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use for scenario-based cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4.

  - Key Facts/Best Practices: 1) Log date, time in/out, detailed task, category, personnel. 2) Critical for chain of custody
  timestamps and admissibility. 3) Align with NIST SP 800-61 IR phases. 4) Tools: Timesheet software, forensic case managers.
  5) Pitfalls: Incomplete/vague logs lead to billing disputes/legal challenges.

  - Concept Map: Time/Billing → IR Phases (Prep/Detection/Analysis/Containment/Eradication/Recovery) → Chain of Custody →
  Reporting/Testimony → Billing Compliance.
