        "core_logic": "Proper handling of network traffic involves capturing raw packet data (e.g., PCAP files) to preserve all details. Documenting capture parameters ensures reproducibility and context. This raw data is essential for in-depth analysis and verification, as real-time analysis alone may miss subtle indicators.",
