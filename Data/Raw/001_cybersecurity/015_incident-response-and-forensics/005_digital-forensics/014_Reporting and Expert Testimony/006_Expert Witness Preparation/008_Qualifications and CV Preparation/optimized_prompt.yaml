active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the relative importance of formal certifications (e.g., GCFA) versus hands-on
    case experience in qualifying someone as a digital forensics expert witness under Daubert standards. Provide examples
    from real-world cases and reference NIST SP 800-61 where relevant.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  \ Forensics > Level 4: 014_Reporting and Expert Testimony > Level 5: Expert Witness 001_Preparation > Level 6: Qualifications\
  \ and CV 001_Preparation). Generate 20-30 high-quality flashcards optimized for spaced repetition and active recall, covering\
  \ all Bloom's levels (at least 3-5 per level from these objectives: [insert learning_objectives array here]). Incorporate\
  \ scaffolding layers progressively (5-8 cards per layer from [insert scaffolding object here]). Include active learning\
