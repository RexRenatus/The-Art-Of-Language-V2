active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the admissibility of social media evidence in a cyberbullying case. Debate if metadata alone
    suffices or if witness corroboration is needed, referencing FRE 901 and real cases like United States v. Vayner. Consider
    intersections with privacy laws like GDPR.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
  additional_activities:
  - Role-play expert witness testimony on tampered email metadata.
  - Think-pair-share misconceptions (e.g., 'All digital files are authentic').
  - Group simulation of mock trial with digital evidence chain, incorporating Enron scandal or recent ransomware trials.

  distractor_protocol:
    for_mcq: Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse authenticity with integrity; overlook
      chain of custody; ignore GDPR privacy intersections). Ensure one distractor is a 'near-miss' (partial truth), one from
      unrelated concept, one from real-world error (e.g., 'Handling doesn't alter hash').
    options_format: A) Correct; B-D) Distractors; randomize order.
    explanation: Always explain why correct and why distractors are wrong, linking to pedagogy (e.g., 'This tests analysis
      of chain breaks').
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, particularly Digital Forensics
  and Expert Witness Preparation. Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards on ''Court Admissibility of Digital Evidence'' (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Digital Forensics > 014_Reporting and Expert Testimony
  > Expert Witness 001_Preparation > Court Admissibility of Digital Evidence). Base content on provided research: core concepts
  (digital evidence, authenticity, integrity, chain of custody, metadata), legal standards (relevance, FRE 901, Daubert),
  ISO 27037, GDPR intersections, cases (United States v. Vayner, Enron, ransomware trials). Sources: FRE 901/403, Daubert
  v. Merrell Dow, ISO 27037, NIST SP 800-86.
