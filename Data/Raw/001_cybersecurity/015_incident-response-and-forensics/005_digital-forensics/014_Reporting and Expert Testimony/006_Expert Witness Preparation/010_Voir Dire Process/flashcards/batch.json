        "core_logic": "Voir Dire first involves qualifying the expert to establish their basic competence (education, experience). Subsequently, attorneys may challenge the specific testimony, arguing it's unreliable, irrelevant, or based on flawed methodology, because the judge must ensure only admissible and credible information is presented.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors confuse the roles of judge and attorneys, misapply the domains of skills tested, or reverse the procedural order of qualification and challenge.",
        "analogy": "Qualifying is like checking if a chef has the necessary culinary training and experience. Challenging is like questioning if the specific dish they propose to make is safe to eat or appropriate for the menu."

        "core_logic": "During Voir Dire, especially with novel tools, the focus is on the expert's understanding of the tool's scientific basis, validation processes, and known error rates, because these factors determine reliability under standards like Daubert. Simply using a tool isn't enough; the expert must demonstrate they understand its scientific underpinnings.",
