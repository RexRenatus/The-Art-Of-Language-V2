active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student teaches the other about UFED's core components (e.g., UFED4PC vs. Physical Analyzer)
    and extraction types, using diagrams; then switch roles and quiz each other on key steps.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: An Android phone locked with biometrics is seized from a cybercrime scene. Outline a UFED-based
    extraction plan, justify the method choice (logical/file system/physical), predict challenges (e.g., encryption), and
    propose mitigation strategies.'

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full array from above].

  - Active Learning: Use for inspiration (e.g., questions on debates/scenarios).

  - Scaffolding: Cover all layers progressively (5-8 cards per layer); include prior knowledge hooks.

  - Big Picture: Emphasize UFED''s role in IR acquisition for mobile incidents; limitations from NIST tests (e.g., partial
  support for encrypted devices).

  - Research Context: UFED extracts/analyzes mobile data (logical/physical/file system); components: UFED4PC, Physical Analyzer;
  challenges: encryption/biometrics. Sources: Cellebrite.com, NIST Mobile Tool Tests.
