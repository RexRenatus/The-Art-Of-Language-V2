active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast X-Ways Forensics evidence file containers with traditional disk images in terms
    of efficiency, legal admissibility, and use cases for incident response. Debate scenarios where one is preferable over
    the other, considering chain of custody and collaboration with tools like X-Ways Investigator.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Digital Forensics tools.
  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on ''X-Ways Forensics'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics
  > Digital Forensics > 002_Forensic Tools and Technologies > Commercial Forensic Suites > X-Ways Forensics). Base content
  on provided research: X-Ways is integrated software (built on WinHex) for disk imaging, evidence file containers (logical
  images with metadata, convertible to .e01), volume snapshots (for deleted/slack analysis), hashing, file carving, workflow
  with X-Ways Investigator. Align with industry standards like chain of custody.
