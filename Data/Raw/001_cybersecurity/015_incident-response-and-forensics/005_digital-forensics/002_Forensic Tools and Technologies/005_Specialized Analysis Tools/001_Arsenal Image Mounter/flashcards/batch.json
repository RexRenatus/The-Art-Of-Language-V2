        "core_logic": "Mounting disk images as complete disks means Arsenal Image Mounter presents the entire image structure (including all partitions and file systems) to Windows as a single, coherent drive. This allows standard forensic tools and OS utilities to function correctly, enabling comprehensive analysis that might not be possible with simple partition or share mounting.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly suggest format conversion, direct modification of physical drives, or limited access to only the boot partition, none of which accurately describe the advantage of mounting as a complete disk.",
        "analogy": "It's like being able to plug in an entire external hard drive and have your computer recognize it fully, rather than just seeing a single folder on it."
