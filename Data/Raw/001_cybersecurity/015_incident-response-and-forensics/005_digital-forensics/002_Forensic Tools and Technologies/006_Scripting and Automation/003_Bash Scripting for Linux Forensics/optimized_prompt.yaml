  discussion_prompt: 'In a live forensics scenario, debate the trade-offs of using Bash scripts for rapid triage versus full
    forensic imaging tools like dd or Autopsy—consider speed (scripts: seconds vs. hours), evidence integrity (live volatility
    risk), and completeness (triage 80% vs. 100%). Support with real-world IR examples.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    write to original logs'' vs. ''redirect to new files''), partial truths (e.g., collects processes but omits ''without
    timestamps''), or plausible errors (wrong command: netstat vs. ss). Ensure distractors teach (explanation debunks them).
    No more than 1 distractor per real vulnerability.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bash Scripting for Linux
  Forensics (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Digital Forensics > 002_Forensic Tools
  and Technologies > Scripting and Automation > Bash Scripting for Linux Forensics). Generate 75 high-quality Anki flashcards
  using the exact schema below. Embed university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives [insert full list above], active learning
  activities [insert summaries], 4-layer scaffolding [insert descriptions], prior knowledge links, big picture (IR triage
  automation, 80% collection efficiency), and completed research context (artifacts: system info/uptime/env/hardware, logs/var/log,
  processes/ps aux/pstree, network/netstat-anp/ss, bash_history, cron/crontab-l/etc/cron.*, with GitHub ex: vm32, logForenix;

  Key Artifacts/commands: uptime, date, whoami, ps auxf, pstree -p, netstat -anp/ss -tulnpe, lsof -i, crontab -l, ls -la /etc/cron.*,
  ~/.bash_history, env, dmidecode/lspci (hardware), /var/log/*.


  Flashcard Schema: CSV rows with Field1=Front, Field2=Back, Field3=Explanation, Field4=Tags. Mix: 30 remember/understand
  (defs/lists), 20 apply (write simple scripts), 15 analyze (compare), 10 evaluate (critique), 10 create (design). Use distractor
  protocol for MCQs. Cover all scaffolding layers progressively. Ensure SMART, measurable, forensics-safe (read-only, timestamps).
  Output ONLY the CSV header + rows, no extras.'
