active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare Plaso super timelines versus tools like Autopsy or Velociraptor for incident reconstruction.
    Discuss trade-offs in scope (artifact breadth), speed, and usability, considering real-world IR constraints like large
    disk images.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., ''psort'' vs. ''log2timeline''); (4) Outdated/wrong commands (e.g., missing .py). Ensure plausible for cybersecurity
    learners.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Digital Forensics (Domain:
  002_Incident Response And Forensics > Digital Forensics > 002_Forensic Tools and Technologies > Timeline Analysis Tools
  > Plaso/Log2Timeline). Synthesize 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/spaced repetition, integrating university
  pedagogy (Bloom''s Taxonomy progression), active learning hooks, 4-layer scaffolding, and web-grounded research (e.g., plaso.readthedocs.io:
  Plaso as Python engine for super timelines from 1000+ artifacts; log2timeline.py CLI; multi-platform beyond logs).


  **Learning Objectives (cover evenly):** [Insert full list from ''learning_objectives'' above].


  **Scaffolding Structure Content By Layer:** [Insert full descriptions from ''scaffolding_layers'' above]. Prioritize voter
  consensus: hands-on commands, misconceptions (artifact breadth), standards (NIST SP 800-86, ISO 27037), datasets (dfir.training).


  **Active Learning Integration:** Include 10% flashcards as ''hooks'' (e.g., ''Discuss: Why use Plaso over Autopsy? [Front]
  → [Back with discussion prompt]'').


  **Output Format:** JSON array of objects per ''flashcard_schema'' above. Balance: 30% Layer 1-2 (foundational), 40% Layer
  3 (apply/commands), 30% Layer 4 (analyze/evaluate/create). Types: 40 Q&A (cloze for commands/terms), 10 MCQ. Ensure distractors
  per protocol. No adult/offensive content; focus on precise, measurable recall for forensics mastery.'
