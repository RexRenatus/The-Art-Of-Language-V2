active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a high-profile criminal investigation involving an encrypted smartphone, debate the ethical and practical
    trade-offs of using proprietary hardware like Cellebrite UFED versus developing custom extraction methods. Reference SWGDE
    best practices (e.g., Best Practices for Mobile Devices Evidence Collection & Preservation) and consider factors like
    data admissibility in court, anti-forensic measures, and misconceptions about 'universal' tools.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ type (minimum 40% of cards): 4 options (1 correct, 3 distractors). Distractors must be plausible:
    1) Common misconception (e.g., ''logical extraction copies entire NAND'' vs physical), 2) Partial truth/real tool confusion
    (e.g., ''GrayKey for Android only'' when it''s iOS-focused), 3) Inverse/extreme (e.g., ''ignores chain of custody'').
    Base on voter priorities, research (e.g., tool examples), avoid randomness.'
