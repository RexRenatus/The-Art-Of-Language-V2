This evidence helps determine how the attacker gained entry, which is crucial for understanding the attack vector and preventing recurrence, aligning with MITRE ATT&CK T1566.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors suggest KAPE removes all emails, analyzes network infrastructure, or encrypts the hard drive, which are not related to collecting evidence of initial access methods.",
        "analogy": "Collecting phishing artifacts with KAPE is like finding the specific 'entry point' evidence (e.g., a dropped key, an open window) that allowed someone to get into a building."
