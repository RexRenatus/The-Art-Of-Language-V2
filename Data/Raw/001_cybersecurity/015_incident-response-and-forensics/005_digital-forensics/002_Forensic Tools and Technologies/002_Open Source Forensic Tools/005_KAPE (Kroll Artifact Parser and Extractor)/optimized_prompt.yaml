active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a time-sensitive ransomware incident, debate whether KAPE's rapid artifact collection should be prioritized
    over full disk imaging. Consider trade-offs in chain-of-custody preservation, data integrity risks, volatility of live
    system artifacts, and alignment with NIST IR lifecycle phases (e.g., triage vs. collection).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    terms (e.g., 'parsing' as 'encryption'). 3) Partial truths/extremes (e.g., 'Always faster than imaging, ignores evidence').
    4) Plausible alternatives (e.g., other tools like Volatility). Ensure distractors teach by reinforcing why they're wrong.

  **Context from Research:** KAPE is a lightweight DFIR tool for rapid artifact collection/processing (e.g., browser history,
  event logs). Features: high-speed triage, targeted/modular (Targets/Modules CSV), parsing/extraction, timeline gen. Commands:
  kape.exe -t Targets.csv -m Modules.csv --tsource Src --tdest Dest. Advantages over imaging: speed, focus. Sources: GitHub/EricRBC/KAPE,
  kroll.com, sans.org.


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list above].

  - Scaffolding: [Insert full scaffolding above, including prior knowledge/concept map].

  - Active Learning: Weave in scenarios from discussion/peer/problem-solving (e.g., ransomware, USB insider threat).


  **Generation Instructions:**

  - Use exact Flashcard Schema above for output format (JSON array of objects, each with question/options/correct/explanation).

  - Ensure university-level rigor: Bloom''s progression, active recall, spaced repetition best practices.

  - Distractors per protocol; explanations scaffolded (link to layers/NIST).

  - Voter Consensus (68.6%): Emphasize pedagogy, completeness, scaffolding.

  - Output ONLY the JSON array of 50 flashcards, no extras.'
