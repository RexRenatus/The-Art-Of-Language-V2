active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group of 4-5, debate the challenges of threat actor attribution in the face of nation-state false
    flags (e.g., NotPetya attributed to Russia despite North Korean overlaps). Evaluate how frameworks like the Diamond Model
    mitigate biases, citing evidence from real cases. Synthesize group consensus on one improvement to attribution processes.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
