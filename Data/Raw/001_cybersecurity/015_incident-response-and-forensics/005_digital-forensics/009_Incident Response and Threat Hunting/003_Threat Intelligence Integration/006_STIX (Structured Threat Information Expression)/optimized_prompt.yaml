active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages and limitations of STIX compared to unstructured threat
    intelligence formats like plain-text IOCs or MITRE ATT&CK matrices alone. Consider real-world adoption in SOCs and barriers
    to implementation. Support arguments with examples from SolarWinds or CISA alerts.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in STIX (Structured Threat\
  \ Information Expression) within the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Digital Forensics\
  \ > 002_Incident Response and 011_Threat Hunting > 005_Threat Intelligence Integration > STIX.\n\nGenerate 75 high-quality\
  \ flashcards optimized for university-level pedagogy: Bloom's Taxonomy progression, active learning reinforcement, 4-layer\
  \ scaffolding (Foundation: basics/CTI/JSON priors; Components: SDOs/SROs/concept map; Implementation: bundles/tools/SolarWinds\
  \ examples; Integration: SOC/threat hunting/MISP). Incorporate voter priorities: real-world (SolarWinds, CISA), tools (stix.sh,\
  \ Python stix2), relationships (SROs like 'indicates'), prior knowledge (IOCs/MITRE), big picture (TI standardization).\n\

  \ 25 MCQ (3 distractors via protocol: misconception/SDO mix/error), 15 scenarios, 5 concept maps. Ensure accuracy (e.g.,\
  \ Vulnerability SDO: exploitable weaknesses), machine/human-readable JSON, progressive complexity."
