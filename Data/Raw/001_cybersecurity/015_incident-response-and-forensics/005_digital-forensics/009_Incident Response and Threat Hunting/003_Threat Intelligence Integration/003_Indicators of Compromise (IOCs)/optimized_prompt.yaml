active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a ransomware scenario, compare IOCs (e.g., known malicious file hashes) and IoAs (e.g., anomalous
    encryption behavior). Which would detect the breach faster and why? Debate the pros/cons with real-world examples from
    MITRE ATT&CK, considering false positives and evasion tactics.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
