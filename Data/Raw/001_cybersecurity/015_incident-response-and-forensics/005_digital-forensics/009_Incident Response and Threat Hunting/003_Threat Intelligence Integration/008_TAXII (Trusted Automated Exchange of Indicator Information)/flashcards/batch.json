        "core_logic": "OASIS publishes interoperability test documents (e.g., for TAXII 2.1) that outline specific use cases and tests for clients (TXC) and servers (TXS). Passing these tests helps ensure that different implementations can successfully exchange STIX data via TAXII.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly limit the scope of testing to only STIX, wrongly assume STIX compliance guarantees TAXII interoperability, or falsely claim interoperability testing is optional and not part of the standard's ecosystem validation.",
        "analogy": "Think of interoperability testing like a compatibility check for different brands of smartphones and chargers. Just because both are 'smartphones' (STIX) doesn't mean every charger (TAXII implementation) will work perfectly with every phone; specific tests confirm compatibility."
