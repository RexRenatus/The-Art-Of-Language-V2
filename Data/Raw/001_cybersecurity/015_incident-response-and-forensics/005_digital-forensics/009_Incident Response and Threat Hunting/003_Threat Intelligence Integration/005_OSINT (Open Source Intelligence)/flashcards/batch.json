      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "OSINT serves as a critical input for threat intelligence integration because its publicly available nature allows for broad data collection that can be cross-referenced with more specific, classified, or proprietary intelligence. This integration builds a richer, more actionable understanding of threats.",

        "analogy": "OSINT is like the general news and public records that provide background context, while other intelligence sources are like specific investigative reports. Integrating both gives a complete story."
