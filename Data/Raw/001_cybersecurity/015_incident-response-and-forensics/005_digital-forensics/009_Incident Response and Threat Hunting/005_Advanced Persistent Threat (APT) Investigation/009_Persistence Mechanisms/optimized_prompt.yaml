  \ Investigation. Topic: Persistence Mechanisms (MITRE ATT&CK TA0003) in hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response\
  \ And Forensics > Digital Forensics > 002_Incident Response and 011_Threat Hunting > Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Investigation\
  \ > Persistence Mechanisms.\n\nIncorporate these elements:\n- Learning Objectives: [insert full learning_objectives array\
  \ here]\n- Active Learning: [insert full active_learning_components array here] (reference in explanations for application).\n\
  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert full scaffolding_layers array here] (distribute flashcards across layers).\n- Prior Knowledge:\
  \ Basic incident response (Domain 002), OS boot processes, MITRE ATT&CK intro.\n- Key Concepts: Persistence definition,\
  \ LOTL vs. malware, accurate techniques (T1547 incl. .001 Registry Run Keys, T1053 Scheduled Task/Job, T1543 Create/Modify\
  \ System Process, T1098 Account Manipulation, T1574 Hijack Execution Flow); avoid errors like T1070 (Defense Evasion).\n\
