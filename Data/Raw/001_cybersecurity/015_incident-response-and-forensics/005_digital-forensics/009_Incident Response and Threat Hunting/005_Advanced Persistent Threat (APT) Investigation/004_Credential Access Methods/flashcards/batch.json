        "core_logic": "Credential dumping obtains the raw credential material (like hashes) from the system because it's the first step, enabling offline password cracking which then attempts to convert those hashes into usable passwords.",

        "analogy": "Credential dumping is like finding a locked diary (the hash); password cracking is like trying to pick the lock on that diary to read its contents (plaintext password)."
