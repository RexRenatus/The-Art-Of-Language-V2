        "core_logic": "Over-provisioning allocates a portion of the SSD's total flash capacity that is not visible to the user. This hidden space is crucial because it gives the FTL and wear leveling algorithms more blocks to work with, allowing them to perform garbage collection and distribute writes more effectively without impacting user-accessible storage.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly associate over-provisioning with encryption, suggest it reduces the need for wear leveling, or define it as user-accessible storage, rather than its role in supporting internal management functions.",

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Extensive wear leveling means data blocks are constantly being managed, moved, and potentially overwritten to ensure even wear. Therefore, forensic analysts must account for data fragmentation and the possibility that older versions of data have been permanently erased, impacting recovery and timeline reconstruction.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors propose incorrect assumptions about contiguous data, guaranteed recovery, or ignoring the FTL, which are contrary to the challenges presented by wear leveling in forensics.",
