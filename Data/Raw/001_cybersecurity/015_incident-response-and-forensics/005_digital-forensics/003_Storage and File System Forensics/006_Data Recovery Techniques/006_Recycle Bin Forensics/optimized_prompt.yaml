active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a corporate investigation, an employee deletes sensitive documents and empties the Recycle Bin. Discuss
    how Recycle Bin forensics could still recover evidence (e.g., via slack space or prior snapshots), potential limitations
    across Windows versions (INFO2 vs. $I files), and ethical considerations in using such evidence in court.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - Common misconceptions (e.g., 'Recycle Bin files are immediately deleted' vs. 'moved to $Recycle.Bin').
  - Version confusions (e.g., INFO2 as option for Vista+).
  - Similar concepts (e.g., SID vs. username; $I vs. $MFT).
  - Irrelevant details (e.g., macOS Trash).
  - Plausible errors (e.g., wrong metadata fields like 'creation time' vs. 'deletion time').
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Digital Forensics. Generate
  50 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Recycle Bin Forensics'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And
  Forensics > Digital Forensics > 004_Storage and File System Forensics > Data 005_Recovery Techniques > Recycle Bin Forensics).
  Base content on provided scaffolding layers, research context (Recycle Bin structure: $Recycle.Bin/SID/$I.dat/$R files;
  INFO2 for XP; metadata parsing; chain of custody), and voter priorities (version details, parsing steps, tools like Autopsy/WinHex).
