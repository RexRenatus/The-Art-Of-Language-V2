        "core_logic": "Comparing 'pslist' (often derived from the kernel's linked list of processes) with 'psscan' (which scans memory structures for process control blocks) is a key technique because it helps identify discrepancies indicative of stealthy process manipulation, such as process hollowing.",

        "analogy": "Using 'pslist' and 'psscan' together is like having two different security guards check a list of attendees. If one guard's list matches the other's, it's likely accurate; if there's a discrepancy, it signals a potential unauthorized person or a tampered list."
