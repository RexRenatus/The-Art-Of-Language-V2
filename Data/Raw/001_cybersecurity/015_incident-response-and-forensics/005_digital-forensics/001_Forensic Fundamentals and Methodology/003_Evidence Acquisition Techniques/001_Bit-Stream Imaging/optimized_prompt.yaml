  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains the bit-stream imaging process using the analogy of photocopying every page
    of a book (including margins and blanks) vs. extracting only readable text; switch roles, then quiz partner on tools (e.g.,
    dd, FTK Imager) and verification steps.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A suspect''s HDD contains potential deleted evidence in unallocated space. In small teams, outline
    imaging steps (write-blocker, tool selection, hashing), simulate hash computation (e.g., SHA-256), verify integrity, and
    enforce chain of custody; debrief on real-world pitfalls like compressed images or multi-drive setups.'
