active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between speed and thoroughness in the Analysis Phase (e.g.,
    rapid triage vs. deep root cause analysis). How does this impact legal admissibility of evidence? Reference NIST SP 800-61
    Rev. 2 and share real-world examples from breaches like SolarWinds.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    1 related but wrong term (e.g., ''Containment'' instead of ''Triage''), 1 plausible partial truth (e.g., ''Uses live systems
    only'' vs. ''Prefers forensically sound copies''). Ensure distractors teach by contrast.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Digital Forensics. Topic:
  ''Analysis Phase'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Digital Forensics > 001_Forensic Fundamentals
  and Methodology > Forensic Process and Lifecycle > Analysis Phase). Builds on prior knowledge from Forensic Process and
  Lifecycle (Identification/Collection phases).


  Incorporate these EXACT elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste full array from ''learning_objectives'']

  - Active Learning: Use components to inspire scenario cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 30% Layer 3, 20% Layer 4.

  - Content Details: Core concepts (incident analysis, root cause, scope, impact, evidence preservation). Standards: NIST
  SP 800-61 Rev. 2 (active, 2012; no Rev. 3). Tools: Wireshark, Volatility, SIEM (Splunk/ELK). Best practices: Triage, timeline
  reconstruction, chain of custody. Sources: NIST links above, SANS Institute.
