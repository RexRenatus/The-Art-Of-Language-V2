        "core_logic": "Unstable power supplies (e.g., brownouts, surges) can cause critical errors during data imaging or analysis, leading to corruption or complete loss of evidence. Therefore, stable power, often via Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS), is a fundamental environmental control for data integrity.",
