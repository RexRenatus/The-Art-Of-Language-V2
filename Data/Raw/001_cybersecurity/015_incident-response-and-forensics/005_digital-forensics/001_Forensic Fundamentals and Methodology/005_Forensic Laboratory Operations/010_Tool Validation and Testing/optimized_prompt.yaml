active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the adequacy of SWGDE minimum requirements for validating a tool used in a high-profile incident
    response case involving multimedia evidence. What gaps exist compared to NIST CFTT methodologies, and how do they impact
    evidence admissibility under Daubert/Frye standards? Discuss in groups and debate potential improvements.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol:
  - Base on voter-noted misconceptions (validation vs. verification; pre-validated tools).
  - Use partial truths (e.g., correct for SWGDE but wrong for NIST).
  - Include unrelated concepts (e.g., from incident response, not forensics).
  - 'Common errors: Over-simplification, reversed steps, ignored admissibility.'
  - Ensure 25% cards basic (Layer 1, REMEMBER), 30% intermediate (Layers 2-3, APPLY/ANALYZE), 45% advanced (Layer 4, EVALUATE/CREATE).
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Digital Forensics. Topic:
  ''Tool Validation and Testing'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Digital Forensics > 001_Forensic
  Fundamentals and Methodology > Forensic Laboratory Operations > Tool Validation and Testing). Prerequisites: Forensic lab
  operations (setup, hardware/software reliability).


  Use this COMPLETE research context: [Insert full provided Research Context + completions: SWGDE full doc/link; NIST CFTT:
  Computer Forensics Tool Testing project develops specifications, procedures, criteria, test sets/hardware for repeatable
  black-box testing of tools like imaging/hash. Ensures accuracy/reliability. Full source: https://www.nist.gov/itl/ssd/software-quality-group/computer-forensics-tool-testing-program-cftt.
  Big picture: Critical for Daubert/Frye admissibility, incident response efficacy. Misconceptions: Validation (user needs)
  vs verification (dev specs); assume pre-validation.]
