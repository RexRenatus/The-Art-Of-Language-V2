  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate: ''How might a broken Chain of Custody jeopardize an entire cybersecurity
    incident response case, even with flawless forensic analysis?'' Connect to real-world examples from legal cases and relate
    to prior knowledge from the Legal and Regulatory Framework.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    plausible for cybersecurity learners.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Digital Forensics. Generate
  20-30 high-quality flashcards on ''Chain of Custody Documentation'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response
  And Forensics > Digital Forensics > 001_Forensic Fundamentals and Methodology > 001_Legal and Regulatory Framework > Chain
  of Custody Documentation).


  Incorporate:

  - Research: CoC is chronological documentation of evidence handling for integrity/authenticity/admissibility (sources: forcyd.com,
  techfusion.com). Purpose: Prove no tampering; broken CoC risks case dismissal.

  - Big Picture: Pivotal in Incident Response lifecycle for prosecutable outcomes.

  - Scaffolding Layers: 1-Foundation (defs), 2-Components (form fields), 3-Implementation (steps), 4-Integration (scenarios).

  - Bloom''s Objectives: Remember (define), Understand (importance), Apply (document), Analyze (breaks), Evaluate (assess),
  Create (design).

  - Active Elements: Draw from scenarios like USB transfer; misconceptions (vs. analysis/encryption).

  - Sample Form Fields: Date/Time, Handler Details, Description, Hash, Signatures.


  Use exact schema:

  [Array of objects: {''front'': ''Q'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''A'', ''explanation'': ''Rationale + Bloom + Layer + Context'',
  ''bloom_level'': ''REMEMBER'', ''layer'': 1, ''distractors'': [''D1'',''D2'',''D3''] (MCQ only)}}]


  Balance: 40% MCQs (plausible distractors), 20% each other types. Ensure progressive complexity, measurable outcomes, and
  no criminal assistance.'
