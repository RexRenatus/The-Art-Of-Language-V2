        "core_logic": "While VPC Flow Logs provide the data for analysis, AWS WAF can be configured to automatically block traffic from malicious IP addresses identified through that analysis, because WAF operates at the edge of the network to filter requests based on defined rules.",

        "analogy": "VPC Flow Logs identify a suspicious visitor (IP address), and AWS WAF is the security guard at the entrance who then actively prevents that visitor from entering based on the information provided."
