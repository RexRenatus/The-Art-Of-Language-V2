active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In small groups, debate the risks of disabling a Lambda function without prior dependency mapping (e.g.,
    EventBridge triggers, API Gateway integrations). How does this align with NIST CSF Respond/Recover functions? Propose
    mitigation strategies and share with the class.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ (3-4 options, 1 correct): Generate 2-3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions—e.g.,
    confuse ''delete-function'' with ''update-function''; mix IAM revocation with trigger removal; reference similar services
    (CloudTrail logs vs. GuardDuty alerts); use real AWS terms but wrong context (e.g., Inspector for compliance, not runtime
    threats). Ensure distractors teach via error (explanation debunks them).'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education for AWS Incident Response. Topic:\
  \ Lambda Function Disablement (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Incident 003_Containment\
  \ Strategies > Cloud-Specific 003_Containment Strategies > AWS 003_Containment Techniques > Lambda Function Disablement).\
  \ Voter consensus: 84.3% approval on pedagogy, completeness, Bloom's coverage.\n\nIncorporate:\n- Learning Objectives: [insert\
  \ full list above].\n- Prior Knowledge: AWS Lambda basics (serverless, event-driven), NIST IR lifecycle, general containment.\n\
  - Research Context: Lambda disablement stops execution for IR containment; methods: IAM revoke invoke, remove triggers (EventBridge/API\
  \ Gateway), delete/update code/versions (Console: Actions > Delete; CLI: aws lambda delete-function/update-function-code/remove-permission;\
  \ API equivalents). Tools: GuardDuty/CloudWatch for ID. Best Practices: AWS Foundational Security (least privilege, monitoring),\
  \ NIST CSF (Respond/Recover). Caveats: Map dependencies, preserve logs.\n- Scaffolding Layers: [insert full list above]—cover\
  \ evenly (5-8 cards per layer).\n- Active Learning: Tie cards to activities (e.g., 'Use in problem-solving scenario').\n\
  \nGenerate 30 high-quality flashcards (10 Q&A, 10 Cloze, 10 MCQ) spanning Bloom's levels (5-6 per level), layers, and objectives.\
  \ Balance: 40% lower-order (Remember/Understand), 60% higher (Apply/Analyze/Evaluate/Create).\n\nOutput as JSON array of\
  \ objects following exact schema:\n{\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"type\": \"MCQ\",\n  \"front\": \"Question text\",\n  \"back\": {\n\
  \    \"answer\": \"Correct answer\",\n    \"explanation\": \"1-2 para detailed explanation with context, pitfalls, pedagogy\
  \ tie-in\",\n    \"blooms_level\": \"Apply\",\n    \"scaffolding_layer\": 3,\n    \"active_learning_link\": \"Links to crypto\
  \ mining scenario\",\n    \"references\": [\"AWS Docs\", \"NIST CSF 2.0\"]\n  }\n}\n\nEnsure flashcards promote active recall,\
  \ use real AWS syntax, plausible distractors (protocol: [insert above]), hands-on focus (Free Tier sim), and error-based\
  \ learning. No fluff; precise, educational."
