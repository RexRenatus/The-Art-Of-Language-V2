active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a GCP incident where anomalous activity is detected from a service account, debate whether immediate
    key disablement is always preferable to rotation or deletion. Consider operational downtime, forensic needs, and least
    privilege principles. Support arguments with references to GCP IAM best practices and NIST CSF Respond (RS) function.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
