  **Core Rules**:

  - STRICTLY GCP-focused: Use only GCP IAM concepts (policy bindings, gcloud CLI, service accounts, no AWS STS/sessions/role
  assumption).

  - Align with these learning objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE].

  - Scaffold across 4 layers: [INSERT scaffolding_layers ARRAY HERE].

  - Incorporate active learning: Reference discussions, peer teaching, problem-solving in explanations.


  **Output 25 flashcards** using this exact schema: [INSERT flashcard_generation_schema.structure HERE].


  **Distractors**: Follow [INSERT flashcard_generation_schema.distractor_protocol HERE].

  **Explanations**: Meet [INSERT flashcard_generation_schema.explanation_requirements HERE].


  Distribute: 30% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 40% Evaluate/Create. Ensure 100% accuracy per GCP docs (e.g., https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies#removing).
  Voter consensus: Prioritize accuracy, GCP commands like `gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding`.
