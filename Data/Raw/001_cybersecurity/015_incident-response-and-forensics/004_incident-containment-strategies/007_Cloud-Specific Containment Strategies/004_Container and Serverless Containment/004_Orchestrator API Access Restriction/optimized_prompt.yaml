active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between RBAC and attribute-based access control (ABAC) for
    restricting orchestrator APIs during time-sensitive incident containment. Reference NIST SP 800-61 and NCSC guidelines
    to support arguments on scalability and security in containerized environments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate this full research context: Orchestrator API access restriction controls access to APIs of tools like Kubernetes
  API server or SOAR (e.g., Splunk Phantom) to prevent unauthorized actions during incidents. Core concepts: Orchestrator
  automates IR; API enables integration; restriction uses RBAC, OAuth, mTLS, gateways, rate limiting. Standards: NIST SP 800-61
  Rev. 2 (Containment: isolate via access controls); NCSC Cloud Security (API protection in containers); MITRE ATT&CK (e.g.,
  T1552.007 Adversary Access via Container APIs, containment via M1037). Best practices: Least privilege, zero-trust, network
  policies. Examples: Kubernetes RBAC steps; Docker Swarm secrets. Sources: NIST.gov/sp800-61, ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud,
  attack.mitre.org.

  ACTIVE LEARNING INTEGRATION: Ensure flashcards support discussion (e.g., comparison Qs), peer teaching (step-by-step), problem-solving
  (scenarios).
