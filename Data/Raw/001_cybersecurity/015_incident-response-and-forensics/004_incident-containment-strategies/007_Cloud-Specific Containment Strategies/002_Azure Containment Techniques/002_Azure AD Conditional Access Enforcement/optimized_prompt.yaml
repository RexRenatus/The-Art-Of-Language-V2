  - Learning Objectives: [Paste full list above]

  - Scaffolding: [Paste full layers above, with prerequisites]

  - Active Learning: Tie explanations to activities (e.g., ''Relates to phishing problem-solving'').

  - Research: Signals (user/device/location/app/risk), Controls (Grant: MFA/block; Session: frequency/restrictions), NIST
  Zero Trust (SP 800-207), MITRE ATT&CK (EX-0006), Microsoft Entra sources.


  Generate flashcards per schema: [Paste full schema above]. Output ONLY in markdown sections (e.g., ## Flashcard 1), numbered
  1-30. Balance: 10 Layer 1-2 (Remember/Understand), 10 Layer 3 (Apply/Analyze), 10 Layer 4 (Evaluate/Create). 50% MCQ, 30%
  basic, 20% scenario. Ensure distractors follow protocol. Promote active recall, no hints.'
