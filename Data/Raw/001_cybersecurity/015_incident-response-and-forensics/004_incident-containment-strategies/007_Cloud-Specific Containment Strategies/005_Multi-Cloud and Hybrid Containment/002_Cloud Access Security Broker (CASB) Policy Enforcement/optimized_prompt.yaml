active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a multi-cloud breach involving shadow IT and compromised accounts, debate the pros and cons of using
    CASB for real-time policy enforcement versus traditional firewall rules. Consider integration with NIST IR phases and
    potential false positives—support your position with examples from cloud security best practices.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    mix up visibility vs. control; reference single-cloud limits in multi-cloud context). Ensure distractors are realistic
    (e.g., from research: ''CASB only for on-premises'' vs. true cloud/hybrid). Avoid obvious wrongs; test for ~25% guessability.'
