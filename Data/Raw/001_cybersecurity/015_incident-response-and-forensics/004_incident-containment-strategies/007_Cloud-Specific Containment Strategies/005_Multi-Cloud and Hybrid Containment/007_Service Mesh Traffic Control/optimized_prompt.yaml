active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast service mesh traffic control with traditional firewall rules for incident containment
    in a hybrid cloud environment. What are the trade-offs in terms of observability, deployment speed, and policy granularity?
    Reference NIST SP 800-204A and discuss how service meshes address microservices security challenges like authentication
    and encryption.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains key service mesh concepts (e.g., Envoy proxy for data plane, traffic routing,
    mTLS for mutual TLS) using a hand-drawn diagram, while the partner teaches back a real-world application in incident containment
    (e.g., isolating pods during a breach). Switch roles and address common misconceptions, such as service mesh being solely
    for load balancing rather than security.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A lateral movement attack is detected in a Kubernetes cluster spanning AWS EKS and Azure AKS
    (mirroring SolarWinds-style supply chain compromises). In small groups, design Istio service mesh policies to: 1) Isolate
    affected pods using AuthorizationPolicies, 2) Block suspicious traffic with VirtualServices and DestinationRules, 3) Enable
    circuit breaking and fault injection for testing resilience. Present and peer-review solutions.'
