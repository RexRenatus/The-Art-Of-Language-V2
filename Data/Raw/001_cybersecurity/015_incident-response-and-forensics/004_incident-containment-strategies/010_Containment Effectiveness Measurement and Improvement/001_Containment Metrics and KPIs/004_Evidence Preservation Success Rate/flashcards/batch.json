        "core_logic": "The forensically sound principle is fundamental because it guarantees that the evidence collected is a true representation of the state at the time of collection. This works by employing standardized, documented procedures and tools that minimize or eliminate any changes to the original data, thus ensuring its admissibility.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Speed, selective collection, or improper storage locations all violate the core principle of maintaining evidence integrity without alteration.",
        "analogy": "It's like a biologist collecting a rare specimen; they use sterile tools and careful handling to ensure the specimen is preserved exactly as found, without contamination."

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Integrating forensics requires careful planning because incident response often demands rapid action (containment), while forensic preservation is meticulous and time-intensive. Balancing these needs is crucial because delaying containment can increase damage, but rushing preservation can render evidence useless.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Forensic tools are abundant. Forensic data can be difficult to access (encryption, etc.). Analysis is often integrated throughout the IR process, not just at the end.",
        "analogy": "It's like a surgeon needing to stop bleeding immediately (containment) while also carefully preserving tissue samples for later study (forensics)."
