  discussion_prompt: 'In a recent ransomware attack like Colonial Pipeline, what containment strategies failed, and how could
    lessons learned be integrated to measure and improve effectiveness in future incidents? Debate in groups: one side argues
    for process changes, the other for technology investments, citing NIST SP 800-61 and CISA advisories.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    forensics only); 2) Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Only for failures, not successes''); 3) Irrelevant but similar

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university pedagogy (Bloom''s
  Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic: **Lessons Learned Integration**
  (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Incident 003_Containment Strategies > 003_010_Containment
  Effectiveness Measurement and Improvement > Continuous Improvement > Lessons Learned Integration).


  **Content Base:** Use this full research context:

  - Core Concepts: IR process, Digital Forensics, Lessons Learned Session (post-incident review), Continuous Improvement.

  - Standards: NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 (integrate IR into CSF 2.0 for risk management, reduce incident impact via iterative
  lessons).

  - CISA: Lessons from incidents like SolarWinds/Colonial Pipeline (e.g., supply chain containment gaps, ransomware MTTC delays;
  advisories stress AARs for prevention).

  - Scaffolding: [Insert full scaffolding from above].

  - Prior Links: NIST IR phases (Containment from prior topics).

  - Sources: NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3, CISA Ransomware Guide, MITRE ATT&CK.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list above].

  **Active Learning:** Incorporate ties to discussion (Colonial Pipeline), peer teaching (layers), problem-solving (mock report
  KPIs).
