active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of integrating AI/ML into containment tools like EDR
    (e.g., CrowdStrike) for real-time effectiveness measurement. How does this align with NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 recommendations,
    and what risks arise in OT environments? Support your points with specific metrics like false positive rates.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate research context: NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 (IR aligned with CSF 2.0 for risk management, emphasizing tool integration
  for containment); NISTIR 8428 (ransomware profiles highlighting automation); tools (SIEM: Splunk, EDR: CrowdStrike Falcon,
  Forensics: Autopsy, SOAR: Palo Alto Cortex); metrics (containment time, coverage rate, false positives, deployment time);
  processes (post-incident gap analysis, AI/ML automation, OT/IT differences).
