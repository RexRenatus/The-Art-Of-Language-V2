        "core_logic": "Threat intelligence feeds provide current IOCs (like malicious IPs or file hashes) that enable automated testing to simulate relevant, modern threats, thus making containment validation more effective.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly suggest threat feeds directly cause blocking, replace vulnerability assessments, or are primarily for compliance reporting, rather than for enriching test scenarios.",
        "analogy": "Threat intelligence feeds are like updated 'most wanted' posters for cybercriminals; they help you design realistic training exercises (tests) to catch them."
