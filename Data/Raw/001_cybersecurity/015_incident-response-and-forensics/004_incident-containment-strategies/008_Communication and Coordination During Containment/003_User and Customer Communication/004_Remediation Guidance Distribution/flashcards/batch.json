      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Social media platforms, while offering broad reach, lack the security controls of official channels. This makes them susceptible to impersonation and the spread of false information, posing a significant risk that malicious actors could distribute incorrect or harmful 'remediation' guidance.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors focus on secondary issues like speed, technicality, or cost, overlooking the critical security risk of misinformation and manipulation inherent in using public, less controlled platforms for sensitive guidance.",
        "analogy": "Using social media for critical remediation guidance is like posting your house key on a public bulletin board: it might reach many people, but it also invites unauthorized access and tampering."
