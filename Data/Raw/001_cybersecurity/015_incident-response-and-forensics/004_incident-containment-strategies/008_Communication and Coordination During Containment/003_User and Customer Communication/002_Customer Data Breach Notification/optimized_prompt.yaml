  discussion_prompt: In a data breach affecting 500,000 customers' PII via phishing, should notification occur within 24 hours
    or after full scope assessment? Debate using NIST SP 800-61 guidelines, real-world cases like Equifax (2017 breach, delayed
    notification leading to $700M settlement), and risk-of-harm thresholds from GDPR/HIPAA.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one partner teaches notification requirements under NIST SP 800-61 (e.g., coordinate during containment,
    post-incident reporting), while the other teaches GDPR/CCPA (e.g., 72-hour authority notification, 45-day consumer notice).
    Switch roles, then quiz each other on differences and overlaps.
  problem_solving: 'Given a scenario: A phishing attack compromises 10,000 customer records (names, SSNs, credit cards). In
    small groups, design a notification plan including: breach scope assessment, timeline (per jurisdiction), required content
    (what happened, what to do next), delivery channels (email, mail, website), and legal review steps. Present and peer-review
    plans.'

  **Completed Research Context (Synthesized/Expanded for Completeness):**

  A customer data breach is unauthorized access/disclosure of PII (e.g., names, SSNs, health/financial data). Notification
  informs affected parties for protection/mitigation.

  **NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 (2012)/Draft Rev. 3:** Incident handling guide: Preparation (communication plans), Detection/Analysis
  (assess impact), Containment/Recovery (coordinate notifications to stakeholders/customers if required), Post-Incident (lessons
  learned). Emphasizes timely, accurate comms during containment; no fixed timeline but risk-based.

  **Regulations:** GDPR (Art33/34: 72h to DPA, high-risk to individuals); CCPA/CPRA (45 days to CA AG + reasonable to consumers);
  HIPAA (60 days to individuals >500 affected); U.S. states (e.g., NY 45 days, FL 30 days); vary by harm threshold.

  **Best Practices:** Assess scope, use clear language, multi-channel delivery, monitor fallout.

  **Sources:** NIST SP 800-61r2 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf); GDPR (https://gdpr.eu/);
  CCPA (https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa); HIPAA Breach Notification (https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/breach-notification/index.html);
