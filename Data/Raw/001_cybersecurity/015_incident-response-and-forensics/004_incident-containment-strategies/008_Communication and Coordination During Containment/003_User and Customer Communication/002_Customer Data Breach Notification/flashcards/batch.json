      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The 'no unreasonable delay' principle, found in regulations like GDPR and many US state laws, underscores that timely notification is paramount because the longer individuals are unaware of a breach, the greater their exposure to risks like identity theft and fraud. This aligns with NIST's focus on timely risk mitigation and stakeholder communication during incidents.",

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Specifying the types of PII compromised is crucial because different data elements carry different risks.

This specificity allows individuals to take targeted actions to protect themselves, a core principle of effective risk communication.",
