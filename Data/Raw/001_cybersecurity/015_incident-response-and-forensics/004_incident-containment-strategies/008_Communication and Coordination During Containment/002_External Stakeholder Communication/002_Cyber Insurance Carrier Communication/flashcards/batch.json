This collaborative review helps both parties improve future preparedness.",

        "analogy": "After a car accident claim is settled, you might discuss with your insurance agent how to prevent future accidents or ensure your policy still meets your needs; this is similar to post-incident communication with a cyber insurer."

        "core_logic": "Effective communication during recovery, as highlighted by NIST SP 800-184, is essential because it synchronizes efforts between the organization and external parties like insurers, manages stakeholder expectations, and supports the efficient restoration of operations and data.",
