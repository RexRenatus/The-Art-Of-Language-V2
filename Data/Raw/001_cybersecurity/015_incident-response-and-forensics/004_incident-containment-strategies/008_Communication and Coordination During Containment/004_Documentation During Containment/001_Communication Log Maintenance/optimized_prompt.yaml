active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of logging all communications (including informal chats) during containment versus
    risking incomplete records for faster response. Use real-world cases like the 2020 Twitter Bitcoin scam (where poor logging
    hindered accountability) or Colonial Pipeline ransomware (highlighting coordination bottlenecks). Consider impacts on
    forensics, privacy, and speed—argue for or against mandatory full logging.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate exactly 3 plausible distractors based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., logs only for tech
    events), 2) Partial truths (e.g., benefits overstated/understated), 3) Confusions with related concepts (e.g., general
    logs vs. communication logs, other IR phases). Each distractor must have a ''why_wrong'' explanation (1-2 sentences) highlighting
    the error and correct nuance. Ensure distractors are realistic to challenge understanding without being tricky.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Incident Response and Forensics.
  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on ''Communication Log Maintenance'' (full hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response
  And Forensics > Incident 003_Containment Strategies > 005_Communication and Coordination During 003_Containment > Documentation
  During 003_Containment > Communication Log Maintenance). Base content on NIST SP 800-92 (log management for generation/transmission/storage/analysis/disposal),
  research (communication logs for timeline/accountability/forensics), voter priorities (completeness, pitfalls like incomplete
  timestamps, examples/templates), and provided scaffolding/active learning.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives (span REMEMBER to CREATE, e.g., define/explain/apply/analyze/evaluate/design).

  - Scaffolding layers (balance 20% Layer1, 30% Layer2, 30% Layer3, 20% Layer4).

  - Active elements (reference discussion trade-offs, peer teach-back, DDoS sim in explanations).

  - Prior knowledge: Link to general logs/IR phases.


  Use EXACT flashcard schema: Output a JSON array of objects [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''correct_answer'': ''...'',
  ''distractors'': [array of 3 with ''option''/''why_wrong''], ''full_explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'':
  ''...'' }}].

  Ensure questions use hierarchy codes (e.g., ''002_''), exactly 3 distractors per card (plausible, explained), comprehensive
  coverage (definitions, benefits, steps, integration, examples/pitfalls like Twitter/Colonial cases). No duplicates; vary
  formats (definition, benefit, step, comparison, critique).'
