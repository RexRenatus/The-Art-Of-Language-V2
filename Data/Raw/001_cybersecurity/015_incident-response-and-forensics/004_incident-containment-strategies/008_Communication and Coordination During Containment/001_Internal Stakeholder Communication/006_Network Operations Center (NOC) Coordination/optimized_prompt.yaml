active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss how ineffective NOC coordination with internal stakeholders (e.g., SOC and IR Team) could escalate
    a containment-phase incident like WannaCry, referencing NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 guidelines. What prior networking knowledge
    (e.g., OSI layers) is critical here?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Completed Research Context:** NOCs monitor/manage network infrastructure for availability/security. Key in IR containment
  via coordination. NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 (Incident Response Recommendations for CSF 2.0) integrates IR into Respond (RS)
  function: preparation, detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery—emphasizing NOC-SOC ops coordination to reduce
  incident impact. Processes: monitoring → alert → escalate → contain. Tools: Slack, ServiceNow, PagerDuty. Example: WannaCry
  (2017)—NOCs detected SMB exploits, coordinated patches/escalations with MSFT/SOC. Concept map: NOC Coordination → NIST RS
  → Stakeholders (SOC/IR/IT Ops) → Processes (monitor-alert-contain). Prior knowledge: OSI model, IR phases.
