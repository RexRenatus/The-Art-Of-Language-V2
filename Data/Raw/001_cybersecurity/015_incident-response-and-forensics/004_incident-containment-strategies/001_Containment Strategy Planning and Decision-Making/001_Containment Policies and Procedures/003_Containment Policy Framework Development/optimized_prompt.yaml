active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student teaches the other the key components of a Containment Policy Framework (e.g., decision
    criteria, procedures, roles), followed by teach-back and Q&A to verify understanding.
  problem_solving: Given an APT lateral movement scenario, design a containment policy including real-world business impact
    considerations (e.g., downtime costs), strategy selection, and integration with forensics; present and iterate based on
    peer feedback.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Containment always means full shutdown''),
    2) Partial truth (e.g., valid for one scenario but not general), 3) Extreme/opposite (e.g., ''Ignore business impact'').
    Ensure plausibility from real-world errors or standards misreads.'
