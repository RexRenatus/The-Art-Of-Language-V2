active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the ethics and effectiveness of activating alternate services (e.g., third-party cloud failover)
    during a nation-state attack on critical infrastructure like power grids. Compare risks of data leakage vs. operational
    downtime, referencing NIST CSF Respond function and SP 800-61 Rev. 3. Use think-pair-share: Think individually (2 min),
    discuss in pairs (5 min), share with class (10 min).'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Use this synthesized content with 4 scaffolding layers, learning objectives, and active learning activities to generate
  high-quality flashcards promoting Bloom''s progression, active recall, and spaced repetition.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full array from above]

  **Active Learning:** [Insert full active_learning object]

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full scaffolding_layers object]


  **Flashcard Generation Rules:**

  - Cover all layers/objectives proportionally.

  - Incorporate voter priorities: NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 details, real-world examples (ransomware/manual processes), prior
  IR links, ethics/risks.

  - Output ONLY in flashcard_schema format: 20-30 cards, numbered, markdown-formatted (e.g., **Front:** ... | **Back:** ...).

  - Vary types: Basic for remember/understand, MCQ for apply/analyze/evaluate/create with distractor_protocol.

  - Ensure explanations tie to pedagogy (e.g., ''Relates to problem-solving exercise'').

  - No intros/conclusions – flashcards only.'
