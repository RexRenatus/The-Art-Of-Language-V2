active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a hybrid cloud environment, how does configuration drift from software updates and manual changes
    impact incident containment? Debate the effectiveness of automation tools like Ansible or Puppet versus continuous monitoring
    solutions like Sysdig Secure, considering trade-offs in cost, scalability, and false positives. This sparks critical thinking
    on real-world trade-offs and misconceptions that drift only occurs from malicious actions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
