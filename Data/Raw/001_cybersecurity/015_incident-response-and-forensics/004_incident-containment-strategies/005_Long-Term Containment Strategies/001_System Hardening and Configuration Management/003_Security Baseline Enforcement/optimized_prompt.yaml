active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of long-term containment strategies, debate whether a standardized security baseline (e.g.,
    NIST SP 800-53B low vs. high-impact) should be universally enforced or tailored per system risk profile. Support arguments
    with pros/cons, real-world examples from incident response (e.g., NIST SP 800-61), and references to benchmarks/controls.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate this research context: Security baseline = minimum security for workloads (Centraleyes); Benchmark = aspirational
  standard; Controls = measures to prevent attacks; Links to NIST SP 800-61 (IR), SP 800-53B (baselines: low/moderate/high).
  OSPS Baseline: Open-source hardening for reproducible enforcement.
