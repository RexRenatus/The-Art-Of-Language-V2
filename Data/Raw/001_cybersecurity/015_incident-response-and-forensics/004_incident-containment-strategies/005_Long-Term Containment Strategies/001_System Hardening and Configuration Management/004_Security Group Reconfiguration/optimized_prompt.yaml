active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: During an active ransomware incident, an attacker has elevated privileges via a misconfigured security
    group granting unauthorized database access. Debate the trade-offs of rapid security group reconfiguration (e.g., removing
    compromised accounts) versus short-term network segmentation, considering factors like business continuity, forensic preservation,
    and potential for re-compromise.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    only for short-term use'' ignoring long-term hardening); (2) Partial truth (e.g., ''Remove all users'' vs. targeted least
    privilege); (3) Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Disable all groups'' risking business continuity). Base on voter-noted
    pitfalls like nested groups or forensic oversight.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Security Group Reconfiguration''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Incident 003_Containment Strategies > Long-Term
  003_Containment Strategies > 008_System Hardening and Configuration Management > Security Group Reconfiguration). Use university-style
  pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives [insert learning_objectives array here], active learning activities [insert active_learning
  object here for context/inspiration], and 4-layer scaffolding [insert scaffolding_layers array here].


  Research Context: Security group reconfiguration modifies security group membership/permissions to contain breaches (NIST
  SP 800-61 Rev. 3 containment/eradication; NIST CSF 2.0 RS.CO-2). Key: Prevent lateral movement, least privilege, platforms
  like AWS/AD. Sources: NIST SP 800-61r2 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf), CSF
  2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/framework), AWS Docs (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html).


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following this exact schema [insert flashcard_schema here]. Ensure cards build progressively:
  30% Layer 1 (REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND), 25% Layer 2 (UNDERSTAND/ANALYZE), 25% Layer 3 (APPLY), 20% Layer 4 (EVALUATE/CREATE).
  Output as JSON array of objects, each matching the structure. Make questions active/recall-oriented, explanations pedagogical
  with NIST ties and voter pitfalls.'
