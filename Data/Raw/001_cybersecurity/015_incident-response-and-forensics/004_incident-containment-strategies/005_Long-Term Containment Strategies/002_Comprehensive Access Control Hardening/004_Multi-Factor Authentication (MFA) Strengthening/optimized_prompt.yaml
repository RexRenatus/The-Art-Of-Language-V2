active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In incident response containment, debate the pros and cons of SMS-based MFA versus phishing-resistant
    methods (e.g., FIDO2 hardware keys) using NIST SP 800-63 guidelines. Consider real-world breaches like the 2022 Okta incident
    where session hijacking bypassed weak MFA. What misconceptions exist about 'all MFA being equal,' and how does this impact
    long-term containment?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
