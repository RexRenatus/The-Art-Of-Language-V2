active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a post-breach scenario, debate the effectiveness of Software-Defined Perimeter (SDP) versus traditional
    VLAN segmentation for long-term containment. Consider factors like lateral movement prevention, scalability in cloud environments,
    and implementation challenges. Address misconceptions, such as assuming SDP is overly complex for small organizations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    vs. identity), 2) Partial truth (e.g., ''VLANs provide dynamic access'' – no, static), 3) Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g.,
    ''SDP eliminates all authentication''). Base on voter-noted misconceptions (SDP complexity, confusion with firewalls/VLANs)
    and research (traditional vs. SDP diffs). Ensure distractors teach by contrast.'

  **Research Context (Web-Grounded):** SDP is an identity-based security perimeter (''never trust, always verify'') hiding
  resources until authenticated. Core: Zero Trust, identity-centric, micro-segmentation, dynamic policies, ''black cloud''.
  Components: Client, Gateway, Controller, Authenticator. Standards: CSA SDP Working Group (full docs: CSA Software-Defined
  Perimeter Architecture), NIST SP 800-207 (Zero Trust), IETF drafts. Sources: CSA resources (SDP Implementation Guide), Cloudflare/OpenZiti
  docs. Big picture: Persistent segmentation for IR containment, prevents lateral movement post-breach.
