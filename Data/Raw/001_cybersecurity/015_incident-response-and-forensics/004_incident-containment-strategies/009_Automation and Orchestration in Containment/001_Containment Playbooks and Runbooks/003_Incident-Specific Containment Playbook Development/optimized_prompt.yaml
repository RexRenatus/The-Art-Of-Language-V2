active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare the containment strategies for a ransomware attack versus a DDoS attack. What factors (e.g.,
    incident scope, urgency, business impact) influence the choice of playbook steps, and how does automation enhance containment
    in each case? Debate the trade-offs in small groups.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  \ here]\n- ACTIVE LEARNING: Use prompts/exercises to inspire higher-order cards (e.g., scenario-based for Apply/Create).\n\
  - SCAFFOLDING: [paste the scaffolding array here]. Distribute cards across layers.\n\nCOMPLETED RESEARCH CONTEXT:\n## Incident-Specific\
  \ Containment Playbook Development\nCore Concepts: [full definitions from scaffolding].\nIndustry Standards:\n- NIST SP\
  \ 800-61 Rev. 2 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-61r2): IR phases including Containment; emphasizes playbooks for consistency.\n\
  - CISA Playbooks: Provides incident-specific guidance, e.g., Ransomware Response Playbook (https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/ransomware-guide)\
  \ details containment like isolating infected systems, disabling accounts; DDoS playbooks focus on traffic scrubbing. Stresses\
  \ automation via SOAR.\n- Additional: MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise (https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/), SANS\
  \ IR Playbooks.\nSources: NIST (above), CISA StopRansomware, CISA DDoS Guidance (https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/ddos).\n\
  \nFLASHCARD SCHEMA: Strictly follow [paste flashcard_schema here]. Use MCQ for analysis/evaluation, scenarios for apply/create.\n\
  \nTASK: Generate exactly 40 flashcards (10 per Bloom's pair: Remember/Understand, Apply/Analyze, Evaluate/Create x2). Ensure\
  \ 10 cards per scaffolding layer. Cover automation/orchestration in 30%. Vary types.\n\nOutput ONLY a valid JSON array of\
