  \nIncorporate university pedagogy: Bloom's Taxonomy objectives [insert full list above], active learning [discussion, peer\
  \ teaching, problem-solving as above], and 4 scaffolding layers [insert full descriptions above]. Ground in NIST SP 800-61\
  \ (phases: Preparation, Detection/Analysis, Containment, etc.), MITRE ATT&CK examples (ransomware, malware), SOAR tools\
  \ (e.g., Splunk Phantom).\n\nGenerate 50-75 flashcards following this schema exactly [insert full schema above].\n\nEnsure\
  \ cards progress from scaffolding Layer 1 (foundation) to Layer 4 (integration), balance Bloom's levels (10-15 per major\
  \ level), and promote active recall. Use precise, measurable language. Output as JSON array of objects, each with 'front',\
  \ 'back' (nested object with answer/explanation/bloom_level/scaffolding_layer/tags), and card_type.\n\nExample card:\n{\n\
  \  \"front\": \"What is a decision tree in incident containment?\",\n  \"back\": {\n    \"answer\": \"Tree-like structure\
  \ with nodes for attribute tests, branches for outcomes, leaves for actions.\",\n    \"explanation\": \"Supports NIST Containment\
  \ phase by adapting to incident variables unlike linear runbooks (Layer 2).\",\n    \"bloom_level\": \"REMEMBER\",\n   \
  \ \"scaffolding_layer\": 1,\n    \"tags\": [\"decision-tree\", \"NIST-800-61\"]\n  },\n  \"card_type\": \"Basic Q&A\"\n\
  }\n\nPrioritize best practices: attribute selection, testing, automation integration. Vary difficulty; include scenario-based\
  \ cards for APPLY/CREATE."
