        "core_logic": "MTTD and MTTR are key performance indicators that measure the time elapsed during critical phases of incident response, because faster detection and response times directly correlate with reduced impact and cost from security incidents.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly narrow the scope of MTTD/MTTR to specific phases (detection, containment) or activities (post-incident analysis), rather than recognizing them as measures of overall process efficiency and speed.",
        "analogy": "Measuring MTTD and MTTR is like timing how long it takes a race car pit crew to change tires and refuel; it assesses the efficiency of the entire process, not just one part of it."
