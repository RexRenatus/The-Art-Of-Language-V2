  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''ITDR is more critical than traditional endpoint detection
    in modern hybrid environments due to the rise of identity-based attacks.'' Support your position with examples from NIST
    CSF functions and real-world breaches (e.g., SolarWinds or Colonial Pipeline), and propose countermeasures involving automation.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., confuse ITDR with IAM only).'
    - 'Distractor 2: Plausible but incomplete (e.g., omit automation in response).'
    - 'Distractor 3: Extreme or outdated view (e.g., ignore machine identities).'
    - Ensure distractors are realistic, derived from research context or voter suggestions (e.g., truncated NIST functions).
      Balance difficulty across Bloom's levels.

  **Research Context (Completed):** Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR) detects, investigates, and responds to identity
  threats like compromised credentials (80%+ of breaches), privilege escalation, lateral movement. Key terms: Machine identities
  (APIs, containers, service accounts). NIST CSF Alignment: **Identify** (IAM discovery), **Protect** (MFA, least privilege),
  **Detect** (UEBA anomalies), **Respond** (quarantine, revocation), **Recover** (rotation, audits). Integrations: SOAR (Splunk
  Phantom, Cortex XSOAR) for automated containment via APIs. Sources: crowdstrike.com/falcon-identity-protection, eye.security,
  identitymanagementinstitute.org, sentinelone.com, arsen.co, nist.gov/cyberframework, mitre.org/attack.

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste the full list from JSON].

  - Active Learning: [Paste summaries].

  - Scaffolding Layers: [Paste full layers].


  **Output Format:** Strictly JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"front": "Question with 4 options (A-D, mark correct as
  **A** etc.)", "back": "Correct Answer: **A** - Justification. Explanation: [detailed]. Bloom: [level]. Layer: [1-4]. Tie-in:
  [optional]."}


  Use flashcard schema: MCQs with distractors per protocol. Ensure pedagogical depth, voter consensus (82.9% approval: completeness
  on NIST, integrations), active recall. Cover all layers/objectives evenly.'
