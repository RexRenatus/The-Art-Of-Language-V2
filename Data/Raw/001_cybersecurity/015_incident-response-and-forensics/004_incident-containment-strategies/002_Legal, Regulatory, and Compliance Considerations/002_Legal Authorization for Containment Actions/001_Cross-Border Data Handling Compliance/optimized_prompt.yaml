    while the other explains NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 containment steps; switch roles and quiz each other on alignments/misalignments.

    containment plan. Include data flow mapping, safeguard verification, legal authorizations (e.g., MLA if needed), and documentation.

  **Core Content (Scaffolded Layers, Complete with Voter/Research Inputs):**

  Layer 1 Foundation: [Insert layer1_foundation content]. Prior Knowledge: NIST SP 800-61 basics, GDPR Art 44-50.

  Layer 2 Components: [Insert layer2_components]. NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3: Emphasizes legal review in containment for intl data.

  Layer 3 Implementation: [Insert layer3_implementation].

  Layer 4 Integration: [Insert layer4_integration].


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full learning_objectives array].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Flashcards should prompt reflection on activities like [briefly summarize active_learning].


  **Sources:** GDPR (ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en), NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 (nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r3.pdf),
  Schrems II (curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?docid=228677), CLOUD Act (congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2383).


  **Task:** Generate 25 flashcards spanning Bloom''s levels (per objectives). Use schema: Output ONLY a JSON array of objects
  matching flashcard_schema (mix types: 8 recall, 10 MCQ, 7 application). Ensure distractors follow protocol. Each card ties
  to a layer/objective. Explanations reference active learning (e.g., ''Relates to problem-solving exercise''). Make engaging,
  precise, educational.'
