active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a fast-moving ransomware attack, should the incident response team isolate affected systems without
    waiting for management authorization, or must they always obtain approval first? Debate the trade-offs between speed,
    legal compliance, and potential liability, using NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 and Rev. 3 as references. Consider misconceptions
    like 'tech teams can act unilaterally' and propose balanced policies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., ''IR teams act without approval''); 2) Partial truths (e.g., Rev. 2 vs. Rev. 3 differences); 3) Related but incorrect
    frameworks (e.g., confuse with CSF vs. SP 800-61). Ensure distractors are web/NIST-grounded but wrong. Mark correct answer
    clearly.'

  Incorporate this research context: [Insert full Research Context here, including completed NIST descriptions: NIST SP 800-61
  Rev. 2 outlines IR phases and organizational structures needing management buy-in; Rev. 3 integrates IR into CSF 2.0 risk
  management, requiring explicit authorizations. Best practices: 1) Define clear policies/escalation paths; 2) Train on workflows;
  3) Document all approvals; 4) Use pre-authorizations for urgency; emphasizing IR as core to risk management. Sources as
  listed.]
