        "core_logic": "Understanding data retention policies is key in preparation because it informs what data should still exist and be preserved, and what might have been legitimately purged according to policy. This works by providing a framework for data lifecycle management.",

        "analogy": "Data retention policies are like a library's cataloging system; they define how long books (data) are kept before being archived or removed, guiding what should still be on the shelves."
