    direct costs in cybersecurity incidents—agree or disagree? Use examples from NIST frameworks and real-world breaches (e.g.,
    Equifax) to support your position, and propose how financial evaluation should weigh these in containment decisions.'''
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

  Use this optimized learning prompt to generate high-quality flashcards:


  **Learning Objectives** (span Bloom''s Taxonomy): [Insert full learning_objectives array here]


  **Active Learning Integration**: Ensure flashcards support discussion (e.g., debatable MCQs), peer teaching (explanations
  for quizzing), problem-solving (scenario cards).


  **Scaffolding** (progressive layers): [Insert full scaffolding object here]. Flashcards must scaffold: start with Layer
  1 recall, build to Layer 4 integration.


  **Research Context**: Financial impact quantifies breach costs for prioritization. Key: Direct/Indirect costs, BIA for financials,
  NIST CSF 2.0/NISTIR 8286D for guidance, cyber resilience. Sources: cyber.gov.au, nist.gov.


  **Flashcard Generation Schema**: [Insert full flashcard_schema here].


  Voter Consensus: 100% approval on pedagogy, completeness, integration.


  Generate flashcards now in the exact output format specified in schema. Ensure variety, accuracy, no fabrication—ground
  in provided context. Cover all objectives and layers.'
