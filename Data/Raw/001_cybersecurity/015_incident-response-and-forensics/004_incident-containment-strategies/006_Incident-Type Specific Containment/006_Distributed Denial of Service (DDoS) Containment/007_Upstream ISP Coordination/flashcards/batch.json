      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Botnets are distributed networks of compromised machines, often spanning multiple ISP networks. Effective mitigation requires ISPs to cooperate in identifying and blocking traffic from C2 servers or the compromised bots themselves, because they control the network infrastructure through which this malicious traffic flows. This distributed nature makes ISP coordination essential.",

        "analogy": "Fighting a botnet is like trying to stop a swarm of insects: you need help from many different pest control services (ISPs) covering various areas to disrupt their nests (C2 servers) and stop them from attacking."
