active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the classification of 'Regulatory Notification Preparation' under Containment
    Strategies versus Communication/Legal Compliance phases in the IR lifecycle (reference NIST SP 800-61r2). Provide examples
    from GDPR and HIPAA breaches, and propose a revised hierarchy if needed.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  (Category: Cybersecurity, Domain: 002_Incident Response And Forensics, Subdomain: Incident 003_Containment Strategies, Entry:
  Incident-Type Specific 003_Containment / Data Breach 003_Containment). Topic Hierarchy: L1 Cybersecurity → L2 002_Incident

  Core Content (completed/enhanced from research): Regulatory notification = formal informing of authorities/stakeholders
  post-breach. NIST SP 800-61r2 (Incident Handling Guide): Emphasizes preparation, coordination (Ch. 3), notifications in
  Response phase. CSF 2.0: RS.CO-4 (external communications). Regs: GDPR Art33 (72h to DPA), CCPA (reasonable time to AG/500+),
  HIPAA (60d HHS/individuals). Preparation: Triggers, forensics integration, templates, review. Sources: NIST SP 800-61r2,
  CSF 2.0, GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA Breach Notification Rule.


  Incorporate:
