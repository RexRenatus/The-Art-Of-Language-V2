active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a live data breach, should organizations immediately revoke all external access to sensitive data
    systems, even if it disrupts critical operations? Argue using NIST CSF Protect vs. Respond trade-offs, comparing/contrasting
    with real cases like the Capital One AWS breach (failed segmentation) and Target breach (successful via network isolation).
    Consider business continuity and insider threats.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate high-quality, optimized flashcards
  for the topic ''Sensitive Data Access Restriction'' (Category: Cybersecurity, Domain: 002_Incident Response And Forensics,

  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives** (span Bloom''s): [insert full list from above]. Ensure ~10 cards per objective.

  - **Active Learning** for context: [insert summaries of discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving]. Inspire scenario-based
  cards.

  - **Scaffolding** (4 layers): Distribute cards evenly [insert full layer descriptions].

  - **Content Sources**: Definitions (Sensitive Data: PII/financial/health/IP; Access Restriction: controls/policies); NIST
  CSF (Identify: assets/threats; Protect: access/encrypt/train; Detect: events; Respond: Containment/restrictions/eradication;
  Recover: restore); RMF (AC controls); Examples (Equifax failure, Capital One AWS, Target success); Principles (PoLP, Zero
  Trust, RBAC); Steps (assess/implement/audit).

  - **Flashcard Schema**: Output JSON array of 40-60 flashcards. Each: {"front": "...", "back": "...", "bloom_level": "REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND/etc.",
  "scaffolding_layer": 1-4, "type": "Q&A/MC/Cloze/Scenario", "explanation": "... (cite sources, why distractors wrong)"}.
  For MC: front lists question + options A-D; back specifies correct + explanation. Distractors: plausible per protocol [insert
  distractor_protocol].


  Best practices: University pedagogy (active recall, spaced repetition); Voter consensus (82.9% approval: pedagogy, completeness);
  Web-grounded (NIST, breaches). Prioritize higher-order thinking in Layers 3-4. Output ONLY valid JSON array, no extra text.'
