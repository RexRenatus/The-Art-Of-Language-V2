active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of rapid quarantine versus phased containment in a live ransomware attack. Consider
    impacts on business operations, forensic evidence preservation, threat actor evasion, and alignment with NIST SP 800-61
    phases.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions: e.g., 1) Confusing quarantine
    with eradication; 2) Overlooking monitoring/forensics; 3) Ignoring business impact/trade-offs; 4) Mixing with detection
    tools. Ensure distractors are realistic (e.g., ''Full shutdown'' vs. ''Selective isolation'').'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert cybersecurity educator and flashcard generator specializing in incident response. Generate
  high-quality, optimized flashcards for the topic ''Quarantine Network Creation'' (Category: Cybersecurity; Domain: 002_Incident
  Response And Forensics; Subdomain: Incident 003_Containment Strategies; Entry: Short-Term 003_Containment Strategies > Rapid
  Network 003_Containment; Level 6: Quarantine Network Creation).


  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives** (span Bloom''s): [insert full list from above].

  - **Active Learning Context** (for scenario cards): Use discussion on trade-offs, peer teaching on steps/NIST, problem-solving
  on topologies.

  - **Scaffolding Layers** (distribute cards evenly): [insert full scaffolding from above].

  - **Research Context**: Quarantine networks isolate compromised systems to prevent spread (NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3: containment
  phase; NIST SP 800-184: quarantine before rejoining production). Tools: VLANs, firewalls (iptables), NAC (Cisco ISE), microsegmentation.
  Best practices: Identify, segment, monitor, preserve evidence. Real-world: Ransomware/APTs. Sources: NIST.gov (SP 800-61,
  800-184), SafetyCulture.com.

  - **Prior Knowledge**: VLANs, firewalls, subnetting, incident detection.

  - **Big Picture**: NIST CSF 2.0 Respond function; prevents lateral movement, enables forensics.


  **Generation Rules**:

  - Create 25 flashcards: ~8 REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND (Layer 1-2), ~10 APPLY/ANALYZE (Layer 2-3), ~7 EVALUATE/CREATE (Layer 3-4).

  - Strictly follow Flashcard Schema: [insert full schema from above].

  - Ensure variety: 30% basic Q/A, 40% MCQ, 30% application/scenario.

  - Make engaging/educational: Reference NIST, tools, trade-offs; avoid overly simplistic cards.

  - Output ONLY the JSON array of flashcards. No additional text.'
