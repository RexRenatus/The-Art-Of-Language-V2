  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the following: ''Is powering off a system ever justified during active
    incident response, or should live forensics always be prioritized to preserve volatile data?'' Support arguments with
    references to NIST SP 800-61 and real-world trade-offs between containment speed and evidence integrity.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

  - 'Make plausible: Use partial truths (e.g., correct tool but wrong step order), common errors (OS mix-up), or edge cases
    (e.g., ''Hibernate instead of shutdown'').'

  **Learning Objectives (span Bloom''s Taxonomy):** [Insert full list above].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full scaffolding above].


  **Active Learning Ties:** Link flashcards to activities where relevant.


  **Content Sources:** Integrate research context (volatile/non-volatile data, NIST SP 800-61 lifecycle, SP 800-184 preservation;
  procedures: assess, capture volatiles w/ FTK Imager/Volatility/WinPMEM, disconnect network, orderly shutdown, document chain
  of custody). Voter priorities: full Bloom''s coverage, misconceptions in distractors.


  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly output in JSON array of objects, each with: {front: str, back: {answer: str, explanation:
  str, bloom_level: str, scaffolding_layer: str, distractors: array (if MCQ)}, metadata: {topic_hierarchy: str, active_learning_link:
  str}}. Follow distractor protocol exactly.


  Ensure pedagogical rigor: University-level, measurable, active recall. Balance levels per schema rules. Output only the
  JSON array.'
