active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between self-service password resets (e.g., via email links)
    and admin-assisted resets during incident containment. Consider risks like phishing exploitation and reference NIST SP
    800-63-4 AAL requirements. What policy would you recommend for a high-security environment?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truth (e.g., confuses AAL1 with AAL3); 3) Extreme/overkill (e.g., ''Always require biometrics''). Base on real
    risks from NIST/research (e.g., phishing, weak proofing). Ensure distractors teach via explanation.'

  **Topic Content (Complete per Voter Consensus 71.4% Approval):** Integrate research: Core concepts (Password Reset, Enforcement,
  Identity Proofing, Authentication, AALs, Federation). Full NIST SP 800-63-4 details: Management Processes (authenticator
  issuance/verification/revocation/recovery; re-proofing for resets); AALs (AAL1: memorized secret; AAL2: multi-factor; AAL3:
  phishing-resistant); Best practices (no self-service email, out-of-band verification, post-reset MFA); Risks (unauth access,
  SIM swaps); Examples (admin-assisted resets in IR). Sources: NIST SP 800-63-4 (draft), SP 800-63B, IR 8011. Prior Knowledge:
  Basic auth/MFA from Domain 001.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives above].


  **Scaffolding:** Generate cards balanced across 4 layers: [Insert scaffolding descriptions].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Tag cards with activity links (e.g., ''Use for peer teaching'').


  **Flashcard Generation:** Follow schema exactly: 40-60 cards, categorized (e.g., 10 REMEMBER Layer1). Use distractor protocol.
  Ensure completeness, measurable verbs. Output JSON array of cards. Vary difficulty; promote retention via spaced repetition
  cues.'
