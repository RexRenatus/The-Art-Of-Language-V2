  discussion_prompt: 'In a BEC attack where Rclone is exfiltrating data from a SharePoint file share, discuss the trade-offs
    of immediate file share disconnection: What are the cybersecurity benefits versus potential business impacts? How would
    you balance these in a real-world scenario? (Encourage critical thinking by requiring students to reference NIST SP 800-61
    containment phase and provide one alternative strategy.)'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    instead of Remove-SmbShare), 2) Procedural (wrong step order/context, e.g., restart server first), 3) Conceptual (confuse
    with eradication phase). Ensure plausible for experts but wrong for learners.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 20 high-quality flashcards on
  ''File Share Disconnection'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Incident 003_Containment
  Strategies > Tactical 003_Containment Methods > Data-Centric 003_Containment > File Share Disconnection). Use the provided
  learning objectives, active learning ideas for context, and 4 scaffolding layers to ensure progressive complexity. Prioritize
  voter suggestions: Bloom''s Taxonomy, BEC/Rclone scenarios, detailed procedures (net use /delete, PowerShell, NFS exports),
  NIST integration, sources (NIST SP 800-61, MITRE ATT&CK).


  Output a JSON array of 20 flashcards, each as: {"front": "Question text", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...
  (cite layer/Bloom''s/source)", "bloom_level": "REMEMBER", "layer_reference": "Layer 1", "distractors": ["d1", "d2", "d3"]}}.


  Follow flashcard schema exactly: Mix types (70% MCQ with 3 distractors via protocol), span objectives/layers. Ensure measurable,
  active recall. No duplicates; build from foundation to integration.'
