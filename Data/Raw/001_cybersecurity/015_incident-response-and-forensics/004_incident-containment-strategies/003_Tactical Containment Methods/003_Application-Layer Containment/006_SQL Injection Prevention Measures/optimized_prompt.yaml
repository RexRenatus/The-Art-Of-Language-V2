active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the scenarios where 'escaping user input' might be preferable over prepared
    statements, using OWASP references. Consider trade-offs in performance, maintainability, and security. Each participant
    must cite a real-world example or impact from the research context.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    ''String concatenation'' instead of ''Prepared Statements''), 2) Related but incorrect concepts (e.g., ''HTML escaping''
    for SQL), 3) Outdated practices (e.g., ''mysql_real_escape_string'' without params). Ensure distractors are realistic
    from research context (e.g., geeksforgeeks.org errors).'

  Generate a comprehensive set of 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for university-level pedagogy. Integrate:

  - **Learning Objectives** (span Bloom''s Taxonomy: use exactly these - REMEMBER: List OWASP''s four defenses; UNDERSTAND:
  Explain prepared statements; APPLY: Implement sample query; ANALYZE: Compare defenses; EVALUATE: Assess code snippet; CREATE:
  Design secure module).

  - **Active Learning Hooks**: End 20% of cards with prompts like ''Discuss: When to use escaping over params?'' or ''Peer
  teach: Demo this code''.

  - **Scaffolding**: Distribute cards across 4 layers - Layer 1 Foundation (10 cards: defs, causes, impacts); Layer 2 Components
  (15 cards: OWASP 4 defenses details); Layer 3 Implementation (15 cards: code examples/step-by-step); Layer 4 Integration
  (10 cards: combos, incident response links).

  - **Voter Consensus**: Fully cover OWASP''s 4 defenses with code: 1. Prepared Statements (e.g., Python: cursor.execute(''SELECT
  * FROM users WHERE name = ?'', (name,)); PHP PDO). 2. Stored Procedures (CALL proc(?)). 3. Escaping (last resort, e.g.,
  mysqli_real_escape_string). 4. Whitelisting (validate inputs to expected values). Assume prior SQL/web app knowledge. Include
  measurable outcomes (e.g., ''80% test case success'').

  - **Research Context**: Base on OWASP Top 10, SQLi Cheat Sheet (owasp.org/cheatsheetseries), geeksforgeeks.org (causes/impacts).
  Cite sources on every card.


  **Output Format (JSON array of objects)**: [{''type'': ''Q&A|MCQ|Cloze|Code'', ''bloom_level'': ''REMEMBER|etc.'', ''scaffolding_layer'':
  ''1-4'', ''front'': ''Question text'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''Bold answer'', ''explanation'': ''1-2 sentences + why distractors
  wrong'', ''code_example'': ''if applicable'', ''reference'': ''OWASP link'', ''active_hook'': ''optional prompt'', ''self_test'':
  ''Mini-quiz''}}]. Ensure variety, no duplicates, distractors plausible. Prioritize active recall and spaced repetition best
  practices.'
