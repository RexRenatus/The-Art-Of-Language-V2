active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue the trade-offs between fully automated quarantine (e.g., via EDR tools) and
    manual intervention during a live incident. Consider scenarios like zero-day threats versus known malware, referencing
    NIST guidelines and real-world breach examples (e.g., WannaCry). What metrics would you use to evaluate success?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom''s Taxonomy, active
  learning, and scaffolding. Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on ''Malware Quarantine Procedures'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Incident 003_Containment Strategies > Tactical 003_Containment Methods > Endpoint
  003_Containment > Malware Quarantine Procedures). Use this COMPLETE research context:


  Core Concepts: Quarantined Malware (isolated malicious files), Isolation (separating infected elements), Containment (stopping
  spread), Malware Analysis (sandbox exam), Network File Trajectory (spread path [cisco.com]).

  Frameworks: NIST SP 800-83 Rev1 (malware prevention/handling: detect, isolate, remove [nist.gov]).

  Best Practices (completed): 1. Confirm detection. 2. Network-isolate endpoint. 3. Quarantine via AV/EDR (Trend Micro Deep
  Security: real-time scan/quarantine to vault; Windows Defender/CrowdStrike). 4. Document IOCs/hashes. 5. Analyze safely.
  6. Post-quarantine: eradicate, scan, restore. Manual alt: Copy to air-gapped folder.
