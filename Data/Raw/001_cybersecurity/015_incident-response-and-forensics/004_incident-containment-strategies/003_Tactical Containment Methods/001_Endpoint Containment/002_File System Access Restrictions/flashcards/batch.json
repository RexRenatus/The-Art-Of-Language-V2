      "question_text": "According to NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2, what is the relationship between containment and eradication in incident response?",
      "correct_answer": "Containment aims to stop the spread and damage, while eradication focuses on removing the threat entirely from the environment.",
      "distractors": [
        {
          "text": "Containment is performed after eradication to clean up residual effects.",
          "misconception": "Targets [phase order confusion]: Containment precedes eradication."
        },
        {
          "text": "Containment and eradication are the same process, just with different names.",
          "misconception": "Targets [definition conflation]: These are distinct, sequential phases with different objectives."
        },
        {
          "text": "Eradication is optional if containment is successfully implemented.",
          "misconception": "Targets [incompleteness of containment]: Containment stops the spread but doesn't remove the root cause."
        }
      ],
      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Containment is the immediate action to limit damage and prevent further spread, working by isolating affected systems or restricting access. Eradication follows to remove the threat actor, malware, or vulnerabilities completely, ensuring the incident is resolved.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly sequence the phases, conflate their definitions, or suggest eradication is unnecessary, misunderstanding the distinct goals and order of these critical IR steps.",
        "analogy": "Containment is like putting out the visible flames of a fire to stop it from spreading, while eradication is like finding and removing the source of the fire (e.g., faulty wiring) to prevent it from reigniting."
