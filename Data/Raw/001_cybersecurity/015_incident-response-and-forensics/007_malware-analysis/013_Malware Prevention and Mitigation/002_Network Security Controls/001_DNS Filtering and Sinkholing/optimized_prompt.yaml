active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of DNS sinkholing versus traditional IP blocking for
    malware mitigation. Consider evasion techniques (e.g., domain generation algorithms) and scalability in large networks.
    Support arguments with real-world examples like the Emotet sinkholing efforts.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse sinkholing with DNSSEC; mix up filtering
      with firewall rules; use similar real tools like 'Firehole' instead of Pi-hole).
    - 'Ensure distractors are 70% semantically similar but factually wrong (e.g., for sinkholing definition: ''Redirects to
      attacker-controlled server'' vs. correct ''controlled sinkhole'').'
    - 'Vary difficulty: 1 easy (obvious error), 1 medium (partial truth), 1 hard (contextual trap from research).'
    coverage: 'Balance: 40% Layer 1/2 (recall/understand), 30% Layer 3 (apply), 30% Layer 4 (analyze/evaluate/create). 50%
      MCQ, 50% short answer/cloze.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Topic: DNS Filtering and Sinkholing (Category: Cybersecurity; Domain:
  002_Incident Response And Forensics > 007_Malware Analysis; Entry: 012_Malware Prevention and Mitigation > 004_003_Network
  Security Controls). Use this hierarchy for context-aware cards.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the 6 objectives above].

  - Scaffolding: Generate cards progressively across 4 layers [paste scaffolding descriptions].

  - Active Learning: Tie explanations to activities [paste active learning].

  - Research: DNS basics, PDNS, filtering (block bad domains), sinkholing (redirect to log server for threat intel), examples
  (Emotet), tools (Pi-hole, Palo Alto), sources (media.defense.gov, docs.paloaltonetworks.com, dn.org). Complete Threat Intelligence:
  Sinkholing logs identify infected hosts/patterns.

  - Prior Knowledge: DNS resolution, malware vectors.

  - Big Picture: Detect→Prevent→Respond in zero-trust.
