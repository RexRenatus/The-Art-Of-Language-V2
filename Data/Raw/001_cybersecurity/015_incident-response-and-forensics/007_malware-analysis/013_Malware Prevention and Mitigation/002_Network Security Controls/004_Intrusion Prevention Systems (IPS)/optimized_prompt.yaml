  **Enhanced Research Context (completed and corrected):**

  IPS monitor network/system activities for malicious actions/policy violations and actively block them, unlike IDS (alert-only).
  Key NIST SP 800-94 ''Guide to IDPS'' (https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-94/final) covers: types (NIPS: network-inline
  blocking; HIPS: host-protection), detection (signature, anomaly, stateful), deployment (planning, inline mode), tuning (false
  positives), integration. Big Picture: IPS enables defense-in-depth, preventing malware propagation via network controls
  before forensics. Prior knowledge: Evolves firewalls (filtering) and IDS (detection).


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s aligned):** [Insert the 6 objectives from above].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers from above].


  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Incorporate references to discussion (IPS vs IDS trade-offs), peer teaching (components/implementation),
  problem-solving (rule design for logs).
