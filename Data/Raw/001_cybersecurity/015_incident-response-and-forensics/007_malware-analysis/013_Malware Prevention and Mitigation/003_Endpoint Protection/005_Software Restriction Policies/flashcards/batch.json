        "core_logic": "During an incident, SRP can be rapidly configured (often via GPO) to block specific malicious files or types of executables using hash or path rules. This prevents the malware from running or spreading further on endpoints, thus acting as a crucial containment measure by enforcing application control at the execution level.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors describe network isolation, decryption, and forensic analysis, which are distinct incident response functions not performed by SRP.",
        "analogy": "Using SRP for containment is like quickly putting up 'Do Not Enter' signs on doors known to lead to dangerous areas during a fire, preventing people from going into harm's way."
