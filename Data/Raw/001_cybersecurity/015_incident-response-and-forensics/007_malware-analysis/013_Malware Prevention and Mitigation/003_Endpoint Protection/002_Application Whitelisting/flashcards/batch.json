        "core_logic": "A trusted path ensures that the communication channel between the user and the application, and the application's execution environment, are secure and free from tampering. This prevents malicious code from intercepting or altering the application's launch or operation, because the integrity of the process is verified.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors confuse trusted path execution with digital signing, network port restrictions, or automatic updates, failing to grasp its focus on secure process integrity.",
