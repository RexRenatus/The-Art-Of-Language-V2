        "core_logic": "Examining the origin and digital signature of a DLL is critical because legitimate software is typically signed by a trusted publisher. An unsigned DLL, or one signed by an unknown or suspicious entity, loaded by a process, strongly suggests a hijacking attempt.",

        "core_logic": "The effectiveness of DLL hijacking and side-loading relies on blending in with normal system operations. Attackers achieve this by using legitimate, often signed, executables to load their malicious DLLs, which makes distinguishing malicious loads from benign ones a significant detection challenge.",
