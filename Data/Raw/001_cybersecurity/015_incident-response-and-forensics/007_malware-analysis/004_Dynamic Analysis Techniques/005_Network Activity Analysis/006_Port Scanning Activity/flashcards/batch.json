        "core_logic": "While IR phases provide a structured approach, real-world incidents rarely follow a strict linear path. New findings during containment might necessitate returning to detection and analysis, or even preparation. This iterative nature allows responders to adapt to evolving situations and ensure thoroughness, because a rigid, sequential approach can lead to missed information or incomplete remediation.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors promote misconceptions of simultaneous execution, devaluing early phases, or complete independence, all of which contradict the adaptive and often cyclical nature of effective incident response.",
        "analogy": "It's like navigating a maze: you might follow a path, but if you hit a dead end, you backtrack (revisit earlier steps) to find a different route."
