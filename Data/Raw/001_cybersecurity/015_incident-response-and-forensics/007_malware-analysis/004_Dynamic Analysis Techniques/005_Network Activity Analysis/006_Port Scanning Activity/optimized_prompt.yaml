  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether port scanning should be restricted to authorized personnel only, considering
    both offensive (adversary reconnaissance, MITRE T1595) and defensive (incident response, network hardening) use cases
    in malware analysis.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse ''filtered'' with ''closed''; mix TCP/UDP behaviors; reference real but
    incorrect port states like ''blocked'' instead of ''filtered''; use similar Nmap flags like -sS vs -sT). Ensure distractors
    are web-grounded (e.g., from NIST errors).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Port Scanning Activity''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 007_Malware Analysis > 003_Dynamic Analysis Techniques
  > Network Activity Analysis > Port Scanning Activity). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives [insert learning_objectives
  array here], active learning [insert active_learning object here], 4-layer scaffolding [insert scaffolding_layers array
  here].


  Generate 50-100 high-quality flashcards following this schema [insert flashcard_schema here].


  Incorporate research: Port states (open/closed/filtered/unfiltered/open|filtered/closed|filtered), scan types (TCP SYN/UDP/XMAS),
  tools (Nmap), frameworks (MITRE T1595/CAPEC-300, NIST SP 800-115). Prior knowledge: TCP/UDP, firewalls. Big picture: Recon
  in IR/forensics, malware C2 detection.
