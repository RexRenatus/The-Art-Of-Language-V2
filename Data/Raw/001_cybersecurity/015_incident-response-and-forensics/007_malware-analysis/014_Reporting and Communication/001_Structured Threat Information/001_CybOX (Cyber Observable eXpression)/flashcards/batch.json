      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "CybOX's integration into STIX 2.0 means that CybOX provides the detailed language for describing cyber events (observables), which are then contextualized within the broader threat intelligence framework of STIX. This integration allows for richer, more complete threat intelligence sharing because it combines specific details with strategic context.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly define their relationship as competing standards, a protocol vs. format distinction, or a division of scope, rather than the reality of CybOX being a component within STIX.",
        "analogy": "It's like how the 'engine' (CybOX) is a crucial part of a 'car' (STIX) – the engine enables the car to function, and the car provides the overall structure and purpose."
