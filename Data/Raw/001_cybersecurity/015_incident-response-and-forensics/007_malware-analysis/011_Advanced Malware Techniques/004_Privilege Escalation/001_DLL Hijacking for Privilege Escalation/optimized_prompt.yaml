active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between usability (e.g., flexible DLL search) and security
    in Windows design. Evaluate how DLL hijacking fits into advanced malware techniques and propose two improvements to the
    Windows DLL loader. Support arguments with research context on search order and real-world exploits like PrintNightmare.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Misconceptions (e.g., ''Windows always uses full paths first'' vs. search order).

    - Partial truths (e.g., mitigations like ''Antivirus scans DLLs'' vs. ''Sysmon monitors loads'').

    - Confusions (e.g., mix with other priv esc like ''DLL side-loading'' vs. ''search order hijack'').

    - Edge cases (e.g., ''Works on Linux too'' vs. Windows-specific). Ensure 1-2 highly tempting distractors per card.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Topic: ''DLL Hijacking for Privilege Escalation'' (Category: Cybersecurity,

  Core content: DLL hijacking exploits Windows DLL search order (app dir, system32, current dir, PATH) by placing malicious
  DLL before legit one, gaining SYSTEM privs. Cover: Definitions (DLL, priv esc), attack chain (recon, craft DLL e.g. Meterpreter,
  deploy, trigger), detection (Sysmon EID7 ImageLoad, ProcMon, ETW, memory forensics), mitigation (full paths, disable writable
  dirs, SafeDLLSearchMode), persistence/evasion (services, signed DLLs), examples (PrintNightmare). Big picture: IR triage,
  threat hunting. Prior knowledge: Windows DLLs/processes, basic priv esc. ETHICS: VM labs ONLY; warn against real misuse.
