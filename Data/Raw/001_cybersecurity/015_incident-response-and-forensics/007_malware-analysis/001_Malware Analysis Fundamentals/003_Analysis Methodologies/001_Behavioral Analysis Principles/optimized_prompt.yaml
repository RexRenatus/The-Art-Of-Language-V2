active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the limitations of static analysis in malware detection (e.g., evasion
    by obfuscation) and how behavioral analysis in sandboxes addresses these, using real-world examples like WannaCry ransomware.
    Support arguments with references to NIST SP 800-61.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: (1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse with static analysis), (2)
    Partial truth (e.g., valid for UEBA but not malware-specific), (3) Extreme/edge case (e.g., normal behavior mislabeled).
    Ensure plausibility from research context or voter priorities (e.g., overemphasize UEBA vs. sandboxing).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Malware Analysis Fundamentals.
  Topic: Behavioral Analysis Principles (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 007_Malware Analysis
  > 007_001_Malware Analysis Fundamentals > Analysis Methodologies > Behavioral Analysis Principles). Focus on dynamic analysis
  in malware context: sandboxing, API monitoring, behavioral IOCs (not general UEBA).

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (Anki-compatible JSON format). Distribute across Bloom''s levels and scaffolding layers.
  Ensure 60% MCQ with distractors, 20% cloze deletions, 20% short-answer for creation/evaluation.


  Output strictly as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'':
