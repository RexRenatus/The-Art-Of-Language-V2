  discussion_prompt: Debate the evolution of C2 infrastructures from centralized IRC-based botnets to modern P2P and domain
    generation algorithm (DGA) methods. Which techniques pose the greatest challenge for incident responders today, and why?
    Use real-world examples like Mirai (IoT-focused DDoS botnet) or Necurs (resilient spam botnet) to support your arguments,
    considering detection, resilience, and attribution in incident response.
  peer_teaching: 'In pairs, one student explains botnet taxonomy (e.g., architecture: centralized vs. P2P; C2 protocols: IRC,
    HTTP, DGA) using a hand-drawn diagram or text-based concept map (Central: Botnet → Branches: Bots/Zombies, C2 Infrastructure,
    IoCs, MITRE TA0011). The partner summarizes key points, quizzes on common misconceptions (e.g., ''botnets only target
    PCs, not IoT devices''), and provides feedback. Switch roles after 5 minutes.'
  problem_solving: 'Provide anonymized network PCAP files simulating C2 traffic (e.g., HTTP beacons to DGA-generated domains).
    Students: (1) Analyze for IoCs (IPs, domains, patterns), (2) Classify botnet type per MITRE ATT&CK, (3) Propose mitigations
    (e.g., sinkholing domains, blocking protocols). Discuss in groups: How does this apply to real incident response/forensics?
    Tools: Wireshark for analysis.'
