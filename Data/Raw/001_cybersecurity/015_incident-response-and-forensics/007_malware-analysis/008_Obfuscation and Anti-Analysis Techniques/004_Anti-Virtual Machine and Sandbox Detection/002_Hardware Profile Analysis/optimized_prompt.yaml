active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how malware authors evolve hardware profile checks (e.g., CPUID hypervisor
    bits vs. advanced timing-based detections) in response to defender countermeasures like VMware hardware customization.
    What are the trade-offs for malware persistence vs. evasion reliability?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Distractor 2: Legitimate physical hw value (e.g., typical RAM 16GB vs. VM default 2GB).'
    - 'Distractor 3: Related but incorrect technique (e.g., timing check vs. static HWID; or defender tool vs. malware check).'
    - 'Ensure plausibility: Base on real VM artifacts or frequent forensics errors; avoid obvious wrongs.'

  high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for the topic ''Hardware Profile Analysis'' under the hierarchy: Cybersecurity >

  Focus EXCLUSIVELY on how MALWARE uses hardware profiles (CPUID leaves, RAM size, disk geometry, BIOS strings, MAC prefixes
  like 00:0C:29 VMware) to detect VMs/sandboxes for evasion—not defender HWAM. Use sources: Practical Malware Analysis (Sikorski),
  Lenny Zeltser guides, NIST SP 800-83 (IR context), Volatility docs.
