  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use concepts from discussions (e.g., modern sandbox evasion), peer teaching (tool demos), problem-solving
  (VM config patching).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers: Foundation (20%), Components (25%), Implementation (30%), Integration (25%).


  Follow this schema exactly:

  [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD_GENERATION_SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]


  Ensure accuracy: Focus on malware techniques (CPUID, GetActiveProcessorCount() for 1-2 core VM detection; resource checks
  like RAM/disk). Sources: Practical Malware Analysis (Ch. 2-5), VirusTotal blogs on anti-VM, NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2/3 (IR
  context). Prior knowledge: Basic VMs/OS multi-core.
