active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare MalwareBazaar with other threat intelligence platforms like VirusTotal. What unique value does
    each provide for malware analysis (e.g., sample exchange vs. file scanning), and in what scenarios would you choose one
    over the other? Support your arguments with references to TTPs or OSINT integration.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Ensure distractors teach by contrasting correct answer.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education on ''Malware Bazaar and Threat Feeds'' (Category:
  Cybersecurity, Domain: 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 007_Malware Analysis; Entry: 014_Threat Intelligence and Attribution

  Threat Feeds.


  Incorporate research: MalwareBazaar (abuse.ch/Spamhaus) shares malware samples via API/datasets for TTPs/threat intel; Threat
  feeds enable proactive defense (e.g., SubrosaCyber, ESET).
