active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the strategic importance of ransom note analysis for attribution and threat
    intelligence. Why should organizations generally avoid negotiation, and how does it contribute to proactive defense via
    TTPs? Reference real-world examples like REvil or LockBit.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [paste full list from above].

  - Active learning: [summarize activities for question inspiration].

  - Scaffolding layers: [paste full layers].

  - Research context: Ransom notes (e.g., README.txt) contain attacker group (LockBit), contacts (Tor/email), payments (BTC
  wallet), threats (double extortion: encrypt + exfil). Frameworks: NIST SP 800-61 IR lifecycle, NIST CSF (Detect/Respond),
  MITRE ATT&CK (TA0040). Sources: MITRE ATT&CK (attack.mitre.org), CISA Ransomware Guide (cisa.gov/ransomware), NIST SP 800-61r2
  (nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf), SANS ICIR (sans.org).


  Big picture: Critical for IR (attribution, TTPs, no negotiation), links malware analysis prereqs.


  Generate exactly 25 flashcards (JSON array) using the EXACT schema provided. Cover all Bloom''s levels (4+ per level), layers
  (6+ per layer), objectives, formative assessments (e.g., MCQs on double extortion). 70% MCQs with EXACTLY 3 distractors
  (plausible: misconception, related term, partial truth). Explain each distractor. Ensure active recall, spaced repetition
  best practices. Output VALID JSON ONLY, no extra text.'
