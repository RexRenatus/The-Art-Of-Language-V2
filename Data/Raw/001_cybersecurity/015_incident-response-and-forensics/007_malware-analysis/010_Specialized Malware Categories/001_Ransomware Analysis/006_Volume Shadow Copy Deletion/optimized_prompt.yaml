active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the strategic importance of Volume Shadow Copy Deletion in ransomware campaigns
    (e.g., why attackers prioritize it over other persistence techniques). Evaluate potential trade-offs between stealth and
    effectiveness, referencing MITRE T1490, and propose two organizational defenses.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    backup service''), 2) Partial truth/mix-up (e.g., wrong command arg), 3) Unrelated but similar technique (e.g., ''bcdedit
    /set {default} recoveryenabled No'' for boot recovery). Ensure distractors are web-grounded (e.g., real commands) and
    teach via ''why_wrong''. Balance coverage: 20% remember, 30% understand/apply, 30% analyze, 20% evaluate/create.'

  Incorporate these EXACTLY:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the 6 objectives above].

  - Scaffolding: [paste the 4 layers + prior/concept/misconceptions].

  - Active Learning: Tie questions to discussion/peer/problem-solving (e.g., ''Analyze for peer quiz'').

  - Research: VSS snapshots, methods (vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet; WMIC shadowcopy delete; PS Win32_ShadowCopy.Delete();
  resize /maxsize=0MB), MITRE T1490 (Impact TA0040), IOCs (EID 7045, Sysmon), examples (Ryuk). Sources: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1490/,

  Generate 40 flashcards in JSON array. Each follows EXACT schema: {''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [{''text'': ''...'', ''why_wrong'': ''...''}, x3]}.
  Ensure progressive coverage (10 cards/layer), high pedagogy (active recall, spaced repetition friendly), distractors teach
  (plausible, misconception-based). Output ONLY the JSON array, no extra text.'
