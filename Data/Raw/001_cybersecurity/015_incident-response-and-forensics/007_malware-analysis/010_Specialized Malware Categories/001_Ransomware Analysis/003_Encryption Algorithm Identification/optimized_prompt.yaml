  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema. Integrate:

  - Learning objectives (span REMEMBER to CREATE as listed).

  - Scaffolding layers (cite layer in explanations).

  - Active learning (reference activities, e.g., ''Apply in problem-solving exercise'').

  - Research: NIST SP 800-57 Part 2 (key mgmt/algorithm recs), case studies (WannaCry: AES-128-CBC+RSA-2048; Ryuk: AES-256),
  tools (CyberChef, Binwalk), methods (headers, entropy).

  - Concept map: Methods (Static/Dynamic/Statistical) → Tools/Dependencies.

  - Prerequisites: Symmetric/asymmetric basics.

  - Big picture: Enables decryption in IR/forensics.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''question'': ''...'', ''correct_answer'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''d1'',
  ''d2'', ''d3''], ''explanation'': ''...''}, ...]. Use snake_case. Questions: 40% MCQ (apply/analyze), 30% recall/understand,
  30% evaluate/create scenarios. Distractors: Exactly 3 plausible per card, explained in explanation. Explanations: 100-200
  words, pedagogical, with voter priorities (completeness, engagement).'
