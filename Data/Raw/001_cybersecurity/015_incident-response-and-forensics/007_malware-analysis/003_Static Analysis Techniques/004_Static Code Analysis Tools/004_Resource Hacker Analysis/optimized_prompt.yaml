active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how Resource Hacker's resource extraction capabilities contribute to rapid
    IOC identification during incident response. Consider scenarios where resources reveal malware evasion techniques (e.g.,
    fake icons or embedded payloads) and connect to prior knowledge of PE file formats.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
