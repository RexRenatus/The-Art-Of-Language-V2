active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between rapid CDN cache purging (to mitigate malware spread)
    and potential user experience disruptions. Reference NIST SP 800-184 recovery principles and real-world examples like
    the 2023 Cloudflare DDoS incidents. What metrics would you use to evaluate success?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    vs. ''Recovery''). Ensure distractors test analysis/evaluation (e.g., outdated practices pre-NIST 800-184).'
