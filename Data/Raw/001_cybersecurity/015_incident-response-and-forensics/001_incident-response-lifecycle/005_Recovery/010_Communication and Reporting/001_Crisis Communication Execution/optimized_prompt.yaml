active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Using real-world examples like the Equifax breach, debate whether immediate transparency or controlled
    disclosure better maintains stakeholder trust during crisis communication. Reference NIST CSF 2.0 guidelines and NIS 2
    Directive requirements to support arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Key Content (Synthesized from Research & Voter Consensus - Complete Truncated Sections):** Crisis communication involves
  strategic internal/external info sharing during cyber incidents to minimize damage and maintain trust. Definitions: Crisis
  Communication (protocols for emergencies [wire.com]), Cyberattack (disrupt access [ibm.com]), IRP (contingency plan [wire.com]).
  Standards: NIST CSF 2.0/SP 800-61 Rev. 3 (integrate response/recovery [nvlpubs.nist.gov]), NIS 2 (auditable records [wire.com]).
  Best Practices (Completed): 1. Pre-Incident: Identify needs (stakeholder groups: customers, employees, regulators, media;
  develop templates/committee). 2. During-Incident: Internal comms (team coordination), external (controlled disclosure, spokesperson).
  3. Post-Incident: Reporting, lessons learned review, metrics (trust surveys, compliance audits).


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Align to Bloom''s objectives: [insert learning_objectives array]. Use scaffolding layers: [insert
  scaffolding array]. Incorporate active learning hooks (e.g., reference Equifax, ransomware scenarios).


  **Output:** JSON array of 25 flashcards, each matching flashcard_schema: {''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'',
  ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''...'', ''...'', ''...'']}, ''metadata'': {...}}. Ensure completeness, accuracy,
