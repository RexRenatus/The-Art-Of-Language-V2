  peer_teaching: Pair students; one teaches the NIST CSF Govern (GV) function's role in defining communication procedures
    and responsibilities, while the other role-plays as a skeptical stakeholder using teach-back to verify understanding,
    followed by peer feedback.
  problem_solving: 'In groups, simulate a ransomware recovery scenario: Design and timeline stakeholder updates (e.g., initial
    notification, daily status, final report), justify choices based on incident severity, risk assessment, and stakeholder
    needs, then present for class critique.'

    vs. tailored info), 2) Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Always daily updates'' vs. severity-based), 3) Plausible
    reverse/opposite (e.g., ''No escalation needed'' vs. severity triggers). Ensure plausible to educated learners, grounded
    in research (e.g., NIST examples).'

  Research Context: Effective stakeholder updates ensure informed decisions in IR/Forensics. Stakeholders: internal/external.
  NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 (full: integrates IR into CSF 2.0 risk mgmt; Preparation: define contacts/templates; Recovery: status
  comms, restoration coordination). CSF 2.0: RS.CO-2 (internal/external comms), RC.IM-1 (recovery comms), GV.OC-05 (oversight).
  Procedures: Classify severity, tailor content/frequency (high: hourly initial/daily; low: weekly), escalation (impact thresholds),
  templates (STAR format), channels (secure). Best practices: Timely/accurate/no speculation; pitfalls: Over-sharing (PII
  breach), under-comm (panic/rumors). Examples: Ransomware - Exec update: ''Systems 80% restored, no data loss confirmed'';
  Regulator: ''Breach notified per GDPR, timeline attached''. Sources: NIST SP 800-61r3.pdf, CSF 2.0.
