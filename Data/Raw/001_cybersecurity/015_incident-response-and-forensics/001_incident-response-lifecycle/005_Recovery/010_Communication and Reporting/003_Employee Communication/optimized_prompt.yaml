  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the risks of over-communication versus under-communication to employees
    during IR Recovery: When might too many updates cause panic or fatigue? How does NIST SP 800-61 guide balancing this?
    Support with real-world examples (e.g., Equifax breach) and propose a hybrid approach.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

  Incorporate these learning objectives [insert learning_objectives array here], active learning ideas for context [insert
  active_learning here], and 4 scaffolding layers [insert scaffolding_layers here]. Base content on NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3,
  NIST CSF 2.0, completed best practices: Establish Notification Protocols (channels: email, intranet, meetings; frequency:
  regular updates), Escalation Procedures, Handling Misinformation/Rumors (single source of truth), Post-Incident Debriefs/Lessons
  Learned.


  Use EXACTLY the flashcard schema [insert flashcard_schema here]: Multiple-choice (1 correct, 3 distractors), structured
  Front/Back, explanations, hierarchy tag. Balance across Bloom''s levels. Output as JSON array: [{''id'':1, ''bloom_level'':''Remember'',
  ''layer'':1, ''front'':{''question'':''...'', ''options'':[''A...'',''B...'',''C...'',''D...'']}, ''back'':{''correct'':''A'',
