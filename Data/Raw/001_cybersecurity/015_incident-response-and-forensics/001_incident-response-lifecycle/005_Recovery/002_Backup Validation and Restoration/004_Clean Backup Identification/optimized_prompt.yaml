  pedagogy (Bloom''s progression, active learning), scaffolding, prior knowledge links.


  Core Content: Clean backups are verified uncorrupted/malware-free for reliable recovery post-incident (ransomware, etc.).
  Principles from NIST: Hashing (SHA-256), digital signatures, air-gapping, immutability. Big picture: Enables safe recovery,
  reduces downtime, IR resilience.
