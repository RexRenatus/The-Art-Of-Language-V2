active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the consequences of failing backup restoration tests during a real-world
    ransomware incident (e.g., reference NIST studies showing 3x faster recovery with tested backups). What common pitfalls
    (e.g., untested encryption) lead to failure, and how can they be mitigated?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list from above]

  - Active Learning: Use concepts from discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving to inspire scenario-based cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers [insert layers summary]; tag each with layer number.

  - Prior Knowledge: Assume familiarity with IR phases and backups; reference as needed.

  - Big Picture: Emphasize Recovery phase role, NIST PR.IP-4, 3x faster recovery.

  Vary formats (MCQ 50%, cloze 30%, short answer 20%). Follow distractor protocol strictly for MCQs. Ensure university-level
  rigor, active recall, and no URL errors.'
