active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a ransomware attack on a critical enterprise server, debate whether to wipe and reinstall the OS from
    scratch or restore from backups. Consider trade-offs in recovery time, data integrity risks, potential for persistent
    threats, and business continuity impacts. Support arguments with references to NIST SP 800-184.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1 common misconception (e.g., ''Restore without verification''), 1 related
      but incorrect term (e.g., ''reimaging'' vs ''repartitioning''), 1 extreme/overly simplistic option (e.g., ''Always wipe
      everything'').'
    - Base on real pitfalls from NIST SP 800-184 (e.g., unverified backups reintroduce malware).
    - Ensure distractors promote analysis (e.g., trade-offs in time vs security).
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Operating System Restoration
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response Lifecycle > 005_Recovery >
  System Restoration > Operating System Restoration). Use the provided Learning Objectives, Active Learning components, Scaffolding
  layers, and Research Context (NIST SP 800-61 IR Lifecycle; NIST SP 800-184 Guide for Cybersecurity Event Recovery: strategies
  for restoring systems post-incident, emphasizing Known Good State, verification, and integration with forensics to prevent
  recurrence. Sources: NIST.gov publications, SANS.org IR guides, CIS benchmarks).


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet, spanning Bloom''s Taxonomy (Remember to Create) and scaffolding
  layers. Follow the exact Flashcard Schema:

  - 40% Basic/Cloze for foundation (L1/L2)

  - 30% MCQ for application/analysis (L3)
