      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Integrating recovery planning into risk management is essential because it acknowledges that incidents will happen and prepares the organization to handle them effectively. This approach functions by identifying potential impacts and developing strategies to mitigate them, thereby reducing overall risk exposure.",

        "analogy": "Risk management is like building a house with safety features (fire alarms, strong foundations). Recovery planning is like having an emergency evacuation plan and ensuring you have insurance – essential parts of managing the risk of fire or structural failure."

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The Detect phase is foundational because it initiates the entire incident response process, including the eventual need for restoration. It functions by monitoring systems and networks for anomalies, which serves as the trigger for subsequent containment, eradication, and recovery actions.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Detection is about identifying potential incidents, not performing restoration, eradicating threats, or documenting the response.",
        "analogy": "Detecting an incident is like a smoke alarm going off. It signals a potential problem that requires investigation and action (like calling the fire department, which leads to putting out the fire and repairing damage)."
