        "core_logic": "The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) defines the maximum tolerable period in which data might be lost from an IT service due to a major incident. It dictates the required frequency of backups, because a lower RPO (e.g., minutes) requires more frequent backups than a higher RPO (e.g., hours or days).",
