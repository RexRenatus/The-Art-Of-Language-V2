        "core_logic": "Recovery validation confirms that restoration processes meet RTO/RPO targets, minimizing business disruption. This is critical because failing to meet these objectives can have severe operational and financial consequences.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly focus on procedural adherence, financial impact assessment, or vulnerability identification, rather than the core goal of meeting RTO/RPO through validated recovery procedures.",
        "analogy": "Validating recovery procedures is like testing an emergency power system to ensure it can keep essential services running within specific time limits (RTO) and without losing critical data (RPO) during a blackout."
