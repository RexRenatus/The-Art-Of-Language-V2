        "analogy": "Routine testing is like a regular car maintenance check-up. Recovery testing is like testing the car immediately after a crash repair to ensure it's safe and drivable again."

        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors propose limiting documentation to failures, restricting its sharing, or accepting insufficient forms of confirmation, all of which contradict the best practice of comprehensive documentation for recovery validation.",
