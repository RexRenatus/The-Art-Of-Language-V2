active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: After a major incident like a ransomware attack, debate whether prioritizing speed in recovery over thorough
    user access testing is ever justified. Use examples from NIST SP 800-61 (e.g., risks of rushed Eradication/Recovery) and
    real-world cases to support arguments for speed vs. security.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Testing only authorized access' ignores unauthorized denial).
    - One from related but wrong concept (e.g., confuse RBAC with DAC).
    - One overly broad/narrow (e.g., 'All cybersecurity testing').
    - One from prior/wrong IR phase (e.g., 'Detection phase activity').
    - Ensure 25-50% difficulty ramp-up across decks, spanning all Bloom's levels.

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste full list from above].

  - Active Learning: [Paste full active_learning JSON].

  - Scaffolding: [Paste full scaffolding JSON] – Distribute flashcards across layers.

  - Research Context: User Access Testing verifies access controls post-incident (NIST SP 800-61 Recovery phase). Key NIST
  docs: SP 800-61r2 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf), SP 800-192 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-192.pdf),
  NISTIR 7874 (OT DFIR: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2020/NIST.IR.7874.pdf), SP 800-53A (testing). Best practices:
  Test authorized/unauthorized access, use RBAC/DAC, tools like Nessus. Misconceptions: Rushed recovery skips testing.


  Generate flashcards per schema: Multiple choice (1 correct, 3 distractors via protocol). Output as JSON array of objects:
  [{''front'': ''Question + options A-D'', ''back'': {''correct_answer'': ''A: text'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''active_learning_hint'':
  ''...'', ''source'': ''URL'', ''bloom_level'': ''Apply'', ''scaffolding_layer'': 2}}]. Ensure university pedagogy: Bloom''s
  progression, active recall, spaced repetition friendly. Prioritize voter consensus (100% approval): completeness, pedagogy,
  scaffolding.'
