active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of NIST CSF 2.0, debate the trade-offs between prioritizing vulnerability remediation
    speed versus thorough risk assessment during incident recovery. Use real-world examples like the Log4Shell vulnerability
    to argue which approach better prevents recurrence and addresses the misconception that vulnerability management is siloed
    from incident response.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Ensure distractors are web-grounded from NIST/CISA and challenge Bloom''s level.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university pedagogy (Bloom''s
