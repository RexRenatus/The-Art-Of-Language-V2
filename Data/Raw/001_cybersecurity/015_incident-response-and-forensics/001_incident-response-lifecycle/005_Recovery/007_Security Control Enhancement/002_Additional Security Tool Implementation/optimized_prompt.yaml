active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: After a major data breach, should an organization prioritize implementing AI-driven threat detection
    tools or enhance existing logging and forensics capabilities? Debate using NIST SP 800-61r3 guidelines, considering cost,
    scalability, recovery time objectives (RTO), and integration with CSF 2.0.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per multiple-choice card: (1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse Recovery
    with Preparation phase), (2) Related but incorrect tool/phase (e.g., SIEM for forensics instead of Volatility), (3) Outdated
    info (e.g., NIST SP 800-61r2 vs. r3). Ensure distractors are 70-80% plausible to challenge understanding without frustrating

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in 'Additional Security Tool\

  \ Response Lifecycle > Level 4: 005_Recovery > Level 5: Security Control Enhancement > Level 6: Additional Security Tool\
  \ Implementation). Use university pedagogy: Bloom's Taxonomy (objectives: [insert learning_objectives array here]), active\
  \ learning ([insert active_learning object here]), and 4-layer scaffolding ([insert scaffolding_layers array here]).\n\n\
  Generate flashcards optimized for spaced repetition (Anki-compatible). Cover NIST SP 800-61r3 fully (phases: Preparation,\
  \ Detection & Analysis, Containment/Eradication/Recovery, Post-Incident Activity), integration with CSF 2.0, tools (SIEM/Splunk,\
  \ EDR/Microsoft Defender, Autopsy/Volatility, NGFW, MFA, deception tech, AI/automation), best practices, and recovery enhancements.\n\
