  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs of implementing zero-trust access controls during incident recovery using NIST
    SP 800-53 AC family—debate usability vs. security with real breach examples like Equifax. Consider misconceptions such
    as 'access control is only pre-incident' and link to prior IR phases like Preparation and Detection.
  peer_teaching: 'In pairs, explain NIST access control properties (Administration, Enforcement, Performance, Support) to
    each other, then teach-back with forensics examples/non-examples (e.g., good: audited RBAC; bad: shared credentials).
    Use think-pair-share for ABAC vs. RBAC in forensics.'
  problem_solving: 'In groups, analyze a post-SolarWinds breach scenario: Design access control enhancements (e.g., MFA, JIT
    access, role-based improvements) and simulate implementation steps, classifying control failures from AC, IA, and SI families.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for the topic ''Access
  Control Strengthening'' (Category: Cybersecurity; Domain: 002_Incident Response And Forensics; Subdomain: 002_Incident Response
  Lifecycle; Entry Domain: 005_Recovery; Entry Subdomain: Security Control Enhancement; Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_IR_Forensics
  > 002_IR_Lifecycle > 005_Recovery > Security Control Enhancement > Access Control Strengthening).


  **Core Content (Research Context):** Access Control (AC) restricts access to authorized entities; key in IR/Forensics for
  evidence integrity. Properties (NISTIR 7874): Administration (policy mgmt), Enforcement (rule application), Performance
  (efficiency), Support (logging). NIST SP 800-53 Rev5: AC family (AC-1 Policy, AC-2 Accounts, AC-6 Least Privilege); IA (IA-2
  ID/Auth); SI (SI-2 Remediation, SI-4 Monitoring enforcing AC policies). Digital Identity (NIST SP 800-63-4). Post-incident:
  Zero-trust, MFA, JIT, RBAC/ABAC enhancements (e.g., SolarWinds/Equifax). Sources: NIST SP 800-53r5, NIST SP 800-63-4, NISTIR
  7874, NIST IR Lifecycle (SP 800-61).


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list from above].

  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Weave in prompts/examples (e.g., ''As in SolarWinds problem-solving...'').

  **Scaffolding:** Distribute cards: Layer 1 Foundation (basics/defs/concept map); Layer 2 Components (frameworks/properties);
  Layer 3 Implementation (steps/examples); Layer 4 Integration (advanced/critique).

  **Prior Knowledge:** Link to DAC/MAC/RBAC, IR phases.


  **Output exactly per Flashcard Schema:** [Insert full schema from above]. Generate 50 flashcards now, numbered 1-50, in
  markdown format for easy import (e.g., ## Card 1

  **Front:** ...

  **Back:** ...). Ensure voter consensus (100%): pedagogy-focused, complete (full NIST/SI details), misconception-based distractors,
  concept map integration. Vary difficulty; optimize for spaced repetition.'
