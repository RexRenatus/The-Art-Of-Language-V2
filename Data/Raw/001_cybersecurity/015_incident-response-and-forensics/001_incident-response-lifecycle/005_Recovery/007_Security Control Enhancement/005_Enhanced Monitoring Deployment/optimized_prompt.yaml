active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2, debate the trade-offs between comprehensive enhanced monitoring
    (e.g., full packet capture) and resource constraints in a mid-sized enterprise. What factors would influence your decision
    to deploy OT-specific monitoring versus standard IT monitoring? Consider real-world priorities like alert fatigue and
    misconceptions about over-monitoring.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
