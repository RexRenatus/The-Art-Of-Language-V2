  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Single-cloud disaster recovery plans can be directly
    adapted for multi-cloud environments without modification.'' Use examples of RTO/RPO misalignment and cross-provider challenges
    to support your arguments, referencing NIST SP 800-61.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Base on common misconceptions (e.g., swap RTO/RPO; assume single-cloud tools work unchanged).
    - Use partial truths (e.g., correct for one provider but not multi-cloud).
    - Incorporate real tools/providers incorrectly (e.g., 'Use AWS Backup for Azure-only').
    - Plausible errors from research (e.g., ignore orchestration in multi-cloud).
    - Ensure 1-2 highly plausible distractors per card.
