        {
          "text": "A BCP is for minor disruptions, while a DR plan is for major disasters.",

          "text": "A DR plan is a subset of a BCP, but BCPs are not relevant to cloud restoration.",

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "While related, BCP and DR plans have distinct roles. BCP ensures the business can continue operating by maintaining critical functions, which may involve manual processes or alternative strategies. DR focuses specifically on restoring the IT infrastructure and data needed to support those functions.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors confuse the scope, relationship, and focus of BCP and DR, incorrectly differentiating them based on disruption scale, applicability, or primary objective.",
        "analogy": "A BCP is the overall plan for keeping a business running during a crisis (e.g., 'we'll use paper records and phone calls'), while the DR plan is the IT-specific part ('we'll spin up backup servers in the cloud')."
