active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the recovery phase of an incident response lifecycle, debate whether organizations should immediately
    reset all privileged account credentials or first implement monitoring and multi-factor authentication. Support your stance
    with NIST SP 800-63B guidelines and real-world breach examples like those involving privilege misuse in 80% of incidents.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response Lifecycle > 005_Recovery > Credential and Access 005_Recovery
  > Privileged Account Credential Reset). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities, scaffolding layers
  (4 layers exactly), and research context to generate comprehensive, high-quality flashcards.


  Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  Active Learning: Incorporate prompts/exercises into explanations where relevant.

  Scaffolding: Generate 10-12 flashcards per layer, tagged by layer. Layer 1: [INSERT FULL DESCRIPTION]. Layer 2: [INSERT].
  Layer 3: [INSERT]. Layer 4: [INSERT].


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: [INSERT FULL SCHEMA]. Ensure flashcards progress through Bloom''s (e.g., basic recall in
  Layer 1, creation in Layer 4). Draw from NIST SP 800-63B (authenticator reset: re-register post-compromise, MFA), SP 1800-18
  (PAM best practices), Equifax example, CyberArk tools, 80% privilege misuse stat. Output ONLY as JSON array of flashcards:
