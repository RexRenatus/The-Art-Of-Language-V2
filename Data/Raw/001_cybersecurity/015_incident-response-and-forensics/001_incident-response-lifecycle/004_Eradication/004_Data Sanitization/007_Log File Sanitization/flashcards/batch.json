        "core_logic": "Logical sanitization is essential because modern storage media (like SSDs and cloud storage) don't always respond to traditional physical sanitization methods. It focuses on using commands and techniques appropriate for the media type to render data inaccessible, because the goal is effective sanitization regardless of the underlying technology.",

        "analogy": "Logical sanitization is like using the right tool for a modern gadget. You wouldn't use a hammer to fix a smartphone screen (physical destruction); you'd use specialized software commands (logical sanitization) to ensure it's properly reset or wiped."
