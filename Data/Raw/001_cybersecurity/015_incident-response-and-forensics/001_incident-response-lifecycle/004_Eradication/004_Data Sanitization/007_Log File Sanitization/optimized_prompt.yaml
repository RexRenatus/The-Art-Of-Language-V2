active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between 'Clear' (overwrite) and 'Destroy' methods for log
    sanitization on SSDs during the Eradication phase. Consider cost, time, and recovery risks in a cloud environment—provide
    evidence from NIST SP 800-88.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Research Context (Complete NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1 Integration):** Log sanitization renders log data (event records from
  systems/networks) unrecoverable per NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1 ''Guidelines for Media Sanitization'': Clear (overwrite 1-4 passes
  for HDDs, e.g., DoD 5220.22-M); Purge (crypto-erase, degauss for HDDs, block erase for SSDs); Destroy (physical: shred,
  disintegrate, incinerate). For logs in IR Eradication: Use shred (Linux: shred -u -v -n 3), sdelete (Windows: sdelete -p
  3 -c), cipher. Verify with tools like hex editors. Sources: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-88r1.pdf;
