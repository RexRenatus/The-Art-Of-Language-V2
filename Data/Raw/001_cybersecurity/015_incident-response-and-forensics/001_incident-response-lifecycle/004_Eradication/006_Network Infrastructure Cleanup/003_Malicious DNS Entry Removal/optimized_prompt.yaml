active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, students select and explain one DNS abuse technique (e.g., cache poisoning or DNS amplification
    for DoS/DDoS) to their partner using simple analogies, such as comparing cache poisoning to tampering with a phone book.
  problem_solving: Provide a mock DNS log with simulated malicious entries (e.g., via Wireshark capture). Students must identify
    anomalies, remove entries (e.g., flush cache commands), verify cleanup with dig/nslookup, and document in an IR report.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ types (30% of cards): Generate 3 plausible distractors based on: 1) Common misconceptions
    (e.g., ''Flushing cache removes external registrar records'' – false, only local). 2) Partial truths (e.g., similar commands
    but wrong OS). 3) Related concepts (e.g., confuse DNSSEC with amplification). Ensure one distractor is a frequent error
    from research (e.g., ignoring verification post-flush).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  using Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, and scaffolding. Topic: Malicious DNS Entry Removal (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response Lifecycle > 008_Eradication > Network Infrastructure Cleanup
  > Malicious DNS Entry Removal). Use the provided learning_objectives, active_learning activities, scaffolding layers (complete
  all content including expanded DNS DoS/DDoS, removal procedures, sources: MITRE ATT&CK T1071/T1562, FIRST.org DNS Abuse,
  Shadowserver, zhauniarovich.com research), and research_context to synthesize comprehensive coverage.


  Generate flashcards that teach progressively: Start with Layer 1 foundations, build to integration. Incorporate active learning
  as scenario cards (e.g., ''In a debate on incomplete cleanup, what risk...?''). Ensure voter priorities: Completeness (full
  techniques: poisoning, amplification/DoS, tunneling; procedures: flush/update/verify/coordinate), pedagogy (measurable objectives,
  engagement).


  Strictly follow flashcard_schema: Output ONLY a JSON array of 60-80 flashcards. Balance: Bloom''s levels, layers, types.
  Distractors per protocol. Explanations: 2-4 sentences, cite sources, link to objectives/activities. No extra text.'
