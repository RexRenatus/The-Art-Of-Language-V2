  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the 6 objectives above].

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste the 4 layers above].

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to discussion (traffic patterns), peer teaching (tools/steps), problem-solving (PCAP analysis).

  - Content Completion: NISTIR 8428 fully: ''NISTIR 8428: Incident Response Recommendations... for CSF 2.0'' – stresses NTA
  for verification. Sources: NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 (IR lifecycle), NIST SP 800-86 (forensics), Wireshark/Zeek docs, SolarWinds
  case studies.


  Generate 40 high-quality flashcards (10 per Bloom''s pair: Remember/Understand, Apply/Analyze, Evaluate/Create; balanced
  across 4 layers). Use schema:

  - Output ONLY a JSON array of objects.

  - Each: {''front'': str, ''back'': str, ''explanation'': str (detailed, with references/active tie-in), ''blooms_level'':
  str, ''layer'': int, ''distractors'': array of 3 strs (for MCQ; [] otherwise)}.

  - Vary types: 30% definition, 30% application, 20% MCQ analysis, 20% creation/open.

  - Ensure pedagogical progression, misconceptions addressed, real-world relevance.'
