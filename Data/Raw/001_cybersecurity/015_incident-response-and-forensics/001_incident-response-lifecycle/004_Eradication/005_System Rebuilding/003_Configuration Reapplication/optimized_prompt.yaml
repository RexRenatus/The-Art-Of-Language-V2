active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the scenarios where configuration reapplication is preferable over full system rebuild in the
    eradication phase. Consider factors like time to recovery, risk of reintroducing malware, evidence integrity, and resource
    availability. Use NIST SP 800-128 and SP 800-61 Rev. 2 to support arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
  additional_activities:
  - Think-pair-share on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Reapplying configs is always faster than rebuilding' – discuss associated
    risks).
  - 'Role-playing simulation: Act as an incident response team voting on reapply vs. rebuild decisions.'

  Incorporate these elements:

  - LEARNING OBJECTIVES: [insert full list from above]

  - SCAFFOLDING LAYERS: [insert full scaffolding from above]

  - ACTIVE LEARNING: Draw questions from discussion debates (e.g., reapply vs. rebuild), peer teaching (e.g., SecCM diagrams),
  problem-solving (e.g., ransomware scenarios).

  - RESEARCH CONTEXT: Use NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 (IR lifecycle: eradication involves rebuilding/removing threats), NIST SP
  800-128 (SecCM, baselines), definitions (config mgmt, hardening, forensic imaging). Sources: NIST publications.

  - CONCEPT MAP: Central ''Configuration Reapplication'' linked to baseline, imaging, hardening → Eradication → Recovery.


  Follow EXACT FLASHCARD SCHEMA: [insert full schema from above]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcards, each as a complete
  object. No additional text. Ensure 82.9% voter-approved completeness: Cover truncated sections (full NIST descriptions,
  sources). Use measurable verbs, university pedagogy (Bloom''s, active learning).'
