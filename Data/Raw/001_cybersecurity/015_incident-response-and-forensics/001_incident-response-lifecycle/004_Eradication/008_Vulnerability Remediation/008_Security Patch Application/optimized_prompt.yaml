active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss the trade-offs between rapid patch deployment for zero-day vulnerabilities and thorough testing
    to avoid system disruptions. Consider organizational risk tolerance and provide examples from NIST SP 800-40.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    but incorrect terms (e.g., ''hotfix'' vs. ''patch''), real-world errors (e.g., Equifax-style delay), or partial truths
    (e.g., ''deploy without verify''). Ensure distractors are plausible and derived from NIST SP 800-40 or voter suggestions.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security Patch Application
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response Lifecycle > 008_Eradication
  > 007_Vulnerability Remediation > Security Patch Application). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy progression, active
  learning integration, 4-layer scaffolding (Foundation: basics/prior knowledge like vulnerability assessment; Components:
  NIST SP 800-40 framework/steps; Implementation: apply steps/checklists/examples like Equifax; Integration: analyze/create/optimize).
  Prior knowledge: Incident Response Lifecycle basics.


  Key content: Patch management lifecycle (identify, prioritize, test, deploy, verify) per NIST SP 800-40 Rev. 4. Definitions:
  Patching (fix software issues), Vulnerability (exploit weakness). Examples: Equifax failure (unpatched CVE).


  Learning Objectives: [Insert the 6 objectives above]. Active Learning: Incorporate prompts like [insert summaries of the
