active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: During the eradication phase of an incident response lifecycle, debate whether teams should apply application
    updates immediately or after thorough testing. Use examples like the WannaCry ransomware, which exploited unpatched SMB
    vulnerabilities, or Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228), to argue trade-offs between speed (reducing dwell time), stability (avoiding
    new bugs), and security (ensuring patch efficacy). Reference NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 lifecycle phases.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
