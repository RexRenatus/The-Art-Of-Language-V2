  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the following: ''Is simple object deletion in a cloud bucket (e.g., AWS S3) sufficient for eradication
    in an incident response scenario, or does it require additional steps like overwriting or crypto-erase? Support your position
    with NIST SP 800-88 references and real-world breach examples (e.g., data recovery from deleted S3 objects). Consider
    data sensitivity levels and cloud provider guarantees.'''
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in 'Cloud Storage Bucket Sanitization'\
  \ (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response Lifecycle > 008_Eradication\
  \ > Cloud Environment Cleanup > Cloud Storage Bucket Sanitization). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet\
  \ using university pedagogy: Bloom's Taxonomy (mix levels), active learning (embed discussion hints), 4-layer scaffolding\
  \ (tag each card), voter consensus (full best practices from NIST SP 800-88 Rev1/2, AWS/GCP/Azure specifics).\n\nIncorporate:\n\
  - Learning objectives: [paste the 6 objectives above]\n- Active learning: [reference activities for hints]\n- Scaffolding:\
  \ [4 layers as defined]\n- Prior knowledge: NIST SP 800-61 IR phases, cloud basics.\n- Sources: NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1 (link),\
  \ Rev. 2 Draft; AWS S3 delete docs; etc.\n- Formative assessments: Include MCQs with distractors on misconceptions.\n\n\
  Best Practices (complete): 1. Establish sanitization program. 2. Assess sensitivity. 3. Delete objects (recursive). 4. Suspend\
  \ versioning/permanent delete. 5. Empty/delete bucket. 6. Verify logs/scans. 7. Document.\n\nOutput ONLY a JSON array of\
