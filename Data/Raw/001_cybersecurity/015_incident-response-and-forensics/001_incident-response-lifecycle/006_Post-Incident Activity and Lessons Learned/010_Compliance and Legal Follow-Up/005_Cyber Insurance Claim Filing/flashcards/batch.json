        {
          "text": "They require the insurer to notify all affected third parties on behalf of the policyholder.",

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Third-party notification requirements are critical because they often align with legal and regulatory obligations (like GDPR or CCPA) and are stipulated in insurance policies. Adhering to these requirements demonstrates due diligence and compliance, which is essential for the insurer to validate the claim and cover associated costs.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly shift notification responsibility to the insurer, limit its scope to government entities, or deem it optional, all of which misunderstand the policy's intent and potential legal implications.",
        "analogy": "It's like a contract clause stating you must inform your landlord if there's a major issue in your rented property; failing to do so could violate the lease agreement (or insurance policy)."

        }
      ],
      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The DOJ's guidance emphasizes that pre-planning is crucial because it establishes procedures for managing and responding to incidents. This preparedness enables organizations to react more effectively, thereby limiting damage, reducing operational impact, and supporting potential investigations, which indirectly aids in substantiating insurance claims.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors present unrealistic outcomes like guaranteed claim approval or immunity, or incorrectly limit the applicability of planning, failing to grasp its practical benefits in incident management and claim support.",
        "analogy": "Pre-planning for a cyber incident is like having a fire escape plan for your building; it doesn't prevent fires, but it ensures everyone knows what to do to minimize harm and get help quickly."
