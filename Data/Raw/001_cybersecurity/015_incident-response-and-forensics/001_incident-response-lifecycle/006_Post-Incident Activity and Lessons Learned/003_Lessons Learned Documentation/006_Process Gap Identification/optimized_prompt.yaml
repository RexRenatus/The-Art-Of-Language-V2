  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, analyze the SolarWinds supply chain attack: What process gaps (e.g., lack of
    supply chain monitoring per NIST CSF 2.0) were evident in post-incident reports? How might proactive gap analysis have
    mitigated recurrence? Support with evidence from NIST SP 800-61r3.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    gap''), (2) Misconception (e.g., ''Gap analysis is pre-incident only''), (3) Partial truth (e.g., correct framework but
    wrong phase). Ensure plausibility from voter suggestions/common errors. Balance: 40% REMEMBER (defs), 30% APPLY/ANALYZE

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Process Gap Identification''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response Lifecycle > 006_Post-Incident
  Activity and Lessons Learned > Lessons Learned Documentation > Process Gap Identification). Use voter consensus (100% approval):
  Emphasize NIST SP 800-61r3, NIST CSF 2.0 (full functions: Govern-Recover), MITRE ATT&CK IR, SANS Handbook, SolarWinds example,
  forensics chain-of-custody gaps.


  Incorporate pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives [insert learning_objectives array], active learning [insert active_learning],
  4-layer scaffolding [insert scaffolding]. Generate 50 flashcards (10-15 per higher Bloom''s levels) optimized for Anki/spaced
  repetition: Active recall, no cloze.


  Follow flashcard_schema exactly: JSON array of objects with ''front'' and ''back'' (answer, explanation, distractors, bloom_level,
  scaffolding_layer, active_recall_prompt). Cover research context: Process gap def, IR/forensics, gap analysis. Ensure completeness:
  Real-world ex, concept map refs, misconceptions.


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards. No intro text.'
