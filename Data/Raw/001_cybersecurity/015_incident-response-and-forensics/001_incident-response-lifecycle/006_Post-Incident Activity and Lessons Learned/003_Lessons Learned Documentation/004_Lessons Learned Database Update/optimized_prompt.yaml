  discussion_prompt: 'In a group of 4-5, debate the following: ''How might failing to update the Lessons Learned Database
    after a ransomware incident lead to repeated breaches, and what metrics should organizations use to measure its value?''
    Encourage critical thinking by requiring evidence from NIST SP 800-61 and real-world cases like the Colonial Pipeline
    attack.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
