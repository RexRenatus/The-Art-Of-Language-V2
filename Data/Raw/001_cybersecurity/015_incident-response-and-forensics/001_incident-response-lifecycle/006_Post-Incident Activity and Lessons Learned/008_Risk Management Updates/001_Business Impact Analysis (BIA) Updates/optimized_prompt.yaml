    (e.g., ''BIA only assesses availability'' vs. CIA triad); (2) Related but incorrect terms (e.g., ERM vs. CSRM); (3) Partial
    truths (e.g., traditional BIA focus); (4) Extreme/outdated views (e.g., ignoring cyber resilience). Ensure distractors
    are realistic and derived from research context or voter suggestions.'

  **Core Content from Research:**

  - BIA evolved from BC/DR (availability-focused) to assess CIA impacts on mission-essential functions (NISTIR 8286D: ''Using
  BIA...'' in ERM/CSRM integration).

  - Key terms: BIA, mission-essential functions, ERM, CSRM, cyber resilience.

  - NIST CSF relation: BIA supports Identify/Protect/Respond/Recover functions for risk prioritization.

  - Post-incident: Updates BIA from lessons learned for continuous improvement.
