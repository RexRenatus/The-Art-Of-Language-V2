  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the potential consequences of failing to update the risk register after
    a phishing incident. How might unaddressed lessons learned propagate risks across the enterprise? Reference NIST SP 800-61
    and provide evidence-based arguments for proactive updates.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    ignore impact''); 2) Partial truth (e.g., ''Review incident but skip prioritization''); 3) Out-of-scope (e.g., ''Focus
    solely on new risks, not existing''). Ensure distractors are realistic, drawn from research context pitfalls.'

  **Risk Register Updates** (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response Lifecycle

  research context:


  ### Core Concepts

  - **CSRR**: Documented risks list (impact, likelihood, controls; searchinform.com).

  - Risk Mgmt: Identify/assess/treat/monitor (cisa.gov).

  - ERM: Enterprise integration (nist.gov).

  ### Standards

  - NIST CSF 2.0: Risk mgmt framework.

  - NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3: Integrate incident lessons into risk mgmt (post-incident analysis → update risks).

  - NISTIR 8286B: Prioritize cyber risks for ERM.

  ### Best Practices (Completed)

  Incorporate Lessons Learned from Incidents: 1) Conduct AAR; 2) Identify new risks/control gaps; 3) Recalibrate likelihood/impact
  with real data; 4) Update mitigations; 5) Prioritize via ERM; 6) Automate/document for continuity (NIST SP 800-61, NISTIR
  8286B).
