active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the real-world consequences of a broken Chain of Custody in a high-profile
    cyber incident (e.g., a ransomware attack on a hospital). Consider impacts on legal proceedings, organizational reputation,
    and lessons learned. Support arguments with NIST SP 800-61 references and voter-identified best practices.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Chain of Custody Documentation\
  \ (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response Lifecycle > 006_Post-Incident\
  \ Activity and Lessons Learned > Forensic 005_Analysis and Investigation > Chain of Custody Documentation).\n\nUse the provided\
  \ scaffolding (4 layers), learning objectives (Bloom's spanning REMEMBER to CREATE), active learning elements, research\
  \ context (NIST SP 800-61, core concepts, completed best practices: label evidence, record who/what/when/where/why/how,\
  \ secure storage, dual signatures, hashes, access controls), prior knowledge (IR lifecycle phases), misconceptions, and\
  \ examples to generate 25 high-quality flashcards.\n\nOutput ONLY in JSON array of objects, each matching this schema:\n\
