active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a post-incident review of a supply chain attack like SolarWinds, debate the value of sharing TTPs
    with industry peers versus risks of exposing vulnerabilities. What frameworks like NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 support this,
    and how do ISACs mitigate risks?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., confuse IOCs with TTPs; mix up IR phases; overstate risks without NIST context; use real but incorrect examples
    like attributing SolarWinds sharing solely to government). Ensure 1 distractor is a ''half-truth'' (e.g., valid in another
    phase), 1 is overly simplistic, 1 is inverse (opposite benefit/risk). Balance difficulty: 20% easy, 50% medium, 30% hard.'

  **Completed Research Context (NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 fully integrated):** NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 ''Computer Security Incident
  Handling Guide'' outlines IR phases: Preparation, Detection & Analysis, Containment/Eradication/Recovery, Post-Incident
  Activity. Post-incident involves lessons learned meetings, reports, and sharing anonymized IOCs/TTPs with peers to improve
  future responses—peer collaboration amplifies this by enabling collective analysis via ISACs (e.g., FS-ISAC shares financial
  sector intel), platforms (MISP for structured threat objects, AlienVault OTX for crowdsourced IOCs), and protocols (STIX/TAXII).
  Rev. 3 aligns with CSF 2.0, emphasizing risk-informed sharing. Benefits: Faster detection via shared intel; Risks: Mitigated
  by anonymization/NDAs. Examples: SolarWinds (Oryx supply chain) leveraged ISAC sharing for TTPs.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives from above].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Embed questions referencing discussion (SolarWinds debate), peer teaching (IOCs/TTPs explain),
  problem-solving (ransomware simulation).


  **Scaffolding:** Cards must map to 4 layers [Insert full scaffolding descriptions from above].


  **Output exactly as JSON array per schema:** [Insert full flashcard_schema.structure, distractor_protocol, generation_requirements].
  Ensure variety, no repetition, spaced repetition optimization (mix easy/hard), and educational value (explanations scaffold
  learning, link to objectives/activities).'
