active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In groups, debate the trade-offs between rapid threat intelligence sharing (e.g., via CISA AIS) and protecting
    sensitive organizational data through anonymization and legal compliance. Use NIST SP 800-150 to support your arguments
    and propose a balanced policy.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs: 3 distractors that are plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse STIX with
    TAXII roles; mix IOCs with TTPs; overlook legal risks). Ensure distractors use similar terminology from research context
    but alter key details (e.g., ''manual sharing'' vs. ''automated TAXII''). No ''all/none'' options.'

  Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response Lifecycle > 006_Post-Incident Activity and Lessons Learned > Information
  Sharing and Collaboration > Threat Intelligence Sharing). Voter consensus: 82.9% approval emphasizing completeness (best
  practices: trust, legal, anonymization, STIX/TAXII; examples: CISA AIS, FS-ISAC) and pedagogy (Bloom''s objectives, 4-layer
