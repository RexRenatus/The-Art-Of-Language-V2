Instead, it recommends using more secure authentication methods like Workload Identity Federation or Google-managed keys. These alternatives reduce the exposure of static, long-lived credentials. Therefore, avoiding user-managed keys is a key preventative measure.",

        "core_logic": "In incident response, a key goal is to minimize the impact of a compromise. Rotating service account keys directly addresses this by limiting the 'dwell time' – the period an attacker can use a compromised credential. Since a leaked key can be exploited indefinitely, regular rotation ensures that even if a key is compromised, its usefulness to an attacker is significantly shortened. Therefore, it's a critical containment and mitigation strategy.",
