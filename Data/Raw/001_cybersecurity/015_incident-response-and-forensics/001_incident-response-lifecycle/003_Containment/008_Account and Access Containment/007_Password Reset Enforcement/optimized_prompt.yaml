  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the following: Given NIST''s shift away from periodic password expirations,
    should organizations enforce event-driven resets only during incidents like account compromises? Support your position
    with evidence from NIST SP 800-63 and real-world breach examples, considering trade-offs in user experience and security.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors from common errors: 1) Promote outdated practices (e.g., ''Require monthly resets
    for all users''); 2) Misalign with NIST (e.g., ignore event-driven focus); 3) Overlook IR context (e.g., forget session
    invalidation); Ensure plausible (e.g., partial truths) but clearly incorrect per research.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Incident Response. Use
  the following to create 25 high-quality flashcards on ''Password Reset Enforcement'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident
  Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response Lifecycle > 003_Containment > Account and Access 003_Containment > Password
  Reset Enforcement).


  **Core Content:** Emphasize event-driven resets (NIST SP 800-63: avoid periodic expirations unless weak controls); Key:
  Detect compromise > Enforce reset > Invalidate sessions > Integrate MFA. Voter consensus (100%): Focus on NIST nuance, IR
  containment ties.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the learning_objectives array here].

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the scaffolding object here].

  **Active Learning Context:** Flashcards should support discussion/debate on periodic vs. event-driven, peer teaching of
  layers, scenario problem-solving.

  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly output JSON array of objects matching: {''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''type'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'',
  ''opt3''] (for MCQs only)}. Follow distractor protocol.


  Generate flashcards progressively: 6-8 per lower layers, more analytical for higher. Ensure accuracy: No promotion of routine
  expirations; align with NIST research. Output ONLY the JSON array.'
