active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the most common ways API keys are compromised (e.g., code repositories,
    insecure storage) and prioritize why immediate revocation during the containment phase is critical to preventing breach
    escalation. Reference real-world examples like GitHub API key leaks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1. Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Revocation rotates
    the key'' instead of invalidates). 2. Related but incorrect concepts (e.g., mix up AWS with Azure steps). 3. Partial truths
    (e.g., ''Only monitor logs, skip isolation''). Ensure distractors test nuance from research/voter priorities.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Incident Response. Topic:
  API Key Revocation (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response Lifecycle > 003_Containment
  > Account and Access 003_Containment > API Key Revocation). Consensus: 68.6% approval.


  Incorporate these exactly:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: Use for inspiration in explanations.

  - Scaffolding: [paste the scaffolding object here]. Prioritize voter suggestions: step-by-step processes, best practices
  for AWS/Google Cloud/Azure, big picture in IR containment, NIST context.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the exact Flashcard Schema: [paste flashcard_schema here].


  Ensure:

  - Content grounded in research: Definitions, NIST SP 800-228, compromise scenarios (GitHub leaks), revocation steps.

  - Pedagogically optimized: Progress from foundation to integration, active recall, spaced repetition friendly.

  - Distractors follow protocol.

  - Output ONLY valid JSON array matching schema''s output_format. No extra text.'
