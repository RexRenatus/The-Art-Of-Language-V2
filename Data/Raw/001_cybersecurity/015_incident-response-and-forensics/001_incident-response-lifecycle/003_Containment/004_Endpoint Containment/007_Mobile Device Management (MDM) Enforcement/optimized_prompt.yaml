active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the risks of BYOD policies in incident-prone environments and propose how
    MDM enforcement with Zero-Trust can enable rapid endpoint containment without disrupting operations. Reference NIST SP
    800-124 Rev. 2 and provide evidence-based arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truth (e.g., correct feature but wrong context); 3) Extreme/opposite (e.g., ''no verification needed'' for
    Zero-Trust). Base on research context, voter suggestions, and real-world pitfalls (e.g., overemphasize personal use in
    COPE). Ensure 70% difficulty progression across layers.'

  **Topic Context (Web-Grounded, Completed per NIST SP 800-124 Rev. 2):** MDM enforces policies on mobile devices (smartphones/tablets)
  for security/monitoring. Key: Ownership models (BYOD: personal for work; COPE: company-owned personally enabled; COBO: business-only;
  CYOD: employee choice from approved). Zero-Trust: Continuous verification. NIST SP 800-124 Rev. 2: Full guidelines for mobile
  lifecycle security (acquisition, deployment, utilization, replacement/disposal), addressing risks like data leakage in IR
  containment via quarantine/wipe/logging. Sources: splashtop.com, soti.net, symmetrium.io, trio.so, NIST docs.
