It outlines user responsibilities, organizational rights, and the procedures to be followed, ensuring actions are consistent and legally sound.

NIST SP 800-124 Rev. 2 emphasizes policy development for mobile device security.",

Failing to contain it allows this bridge to be exploited, leading to data breaches, as highlighted in mobile security best practices.",
