  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives: [insert learning_objectives array here]

  - Scaffolding: Build from Layer 1 (Foundation) to Layer 4 (Integration) as defined: [insert scaffolding_layers here]

  - Active learning ties: Flashcards should prompt recall usable in discussions/problem-solving like [briefly summarize active_learning_components].

  - Best Practices: Least privilege, change management (versioning), testing rules, logging (CloudTrail/Flow Logs), auditing,
  rollback plans.

  - Sources: AWS Security Groups Documentation (docs.aws.amazon.com), Google Cloud VPC Firewall Rules (cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls),
  NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 (IR-4, SC-7, AC-4), CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark v1.4.0, CIS Google Cloud v1.1.0.
