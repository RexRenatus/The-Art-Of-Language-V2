        "core_logic": "The principle of least privilege dictates that an entity should only have the permissions and access necessary to perform its intended function. In cloud instance isolation, this means restricting network traffic to only what is absolutely required for forensic data exfiltration or critical, non-compromised functions, thereby minimizing the attack surface.",

        "analogy": "Applying least privilege to an isolated instance is like giving a detective investigating a crime scene only the keys to the specific rooms they need to examine, not the entire building."

NISTIR 8006 highlights this ephemerality as a major hurdle for evidence preservation.",
