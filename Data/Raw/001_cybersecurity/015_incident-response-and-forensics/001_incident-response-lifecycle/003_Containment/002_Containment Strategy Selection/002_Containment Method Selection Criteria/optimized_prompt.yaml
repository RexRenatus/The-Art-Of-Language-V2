active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue for or against using an aggressive containment strategy (e.g., full network
    isolation) in a ransomware incident affecting critical services. Use NIST criteria to justify your position and respond
    to counterarguments, fostering critical thinking on trade-offs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
