        "core_logic": "The principle of least privilege is fundamental to containment because it limits the potential damage an attacker can cause if an account is compromised. By ensuring accounts have only necessary permissions, it functions to restrict lateral movement and unauthorized actions, thereby reducing the incident's scope.",
