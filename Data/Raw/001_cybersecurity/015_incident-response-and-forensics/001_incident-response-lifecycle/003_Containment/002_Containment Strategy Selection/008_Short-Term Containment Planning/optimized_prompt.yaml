active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between aggressive short-term containment (e.g., full system shutdown) vs. measured
    response (e.g., traffic filtering via firewall rules) in a live production environment—what factors (business impact,
    evidence preservation, attacker evasion) decide the best approach?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains a short-term containment strategy from NIST SP 800-61 (e.g., IP blocking or
    VLAN segmentation) to their partner, who then categorizes it as suitable for ransomware, insider threat, or DDoS, and
    provides a real-world example.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: Active Directory compromise detected with lateral movement. Design a 5-step short-term containment
    plan, prioritizing actions like disabling compromised credentials, snapshotting memory, and blocking C2 traffic. Simulate
    using tools like Wireshark in a virtual lab and justify choices.'
