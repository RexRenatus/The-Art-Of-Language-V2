        "core_logic": "Egress filtering specifically manages traffic leaving the network. By defining rules for allowed outbound protocols, ports, and destinations, organizations can block C2 communication attempting to reach external adversary infrastructure.",

        "analogy": "Egress filtering is like a security guard at the exit of a building, checking everyone and everything leaving to ensure nothing unauthorized is being taken out."
