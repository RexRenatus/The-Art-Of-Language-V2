active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group of 4, debate the most critical training gap for executives versus technical roles (e.g., Forensic
    Analysts) in OT DFIR scenarios. Use NIST IR phases to argue priorities and propose one hybrid module—record key insights
    and trade-offs for class share-out (encourages critical thinking on role interdependencies).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    instead of analysis); 2) Partial truths (e.g., NIST phase swapped); 3) Role confusions (e.g., Manager duties for Responder);
    4) Out-of-context facts (e.g., IT vs. OT specifics). Ensure 1-2 distractors per card are ''almost correct'' to test nuance.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom''s Taxonomy, active
  learning, and scaffolding. Topic: Role-Specific Training Modules (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics
  > 002_Incident Response Lifecycle > 001_Preparation > 014_Training and Awareness > Role-Specific Training Modules). Use
  this research context: Core concepts - IR (safetyculture.com), IRP, DFIR/OT DFIR (nvlpubs.nist.gov/sp-800-61), Threat Intelligence
  (ncsc.gov.uk). Frameworks: NIST SP 800-61 (full phases: Preparation-Recovery), NIST CSF. Voter priorities: Role examples
  (Incident Responder, Forensic Analyst, Manager), SMART Bloom''s objectives, 4-layer scaffolding, prior knowledge links.

  Generate flashcards following EXACT schema: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Distribute across Bloom''s (10-15%
  Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 20% Evaluate/Create, rest mixed). Ensure 20% OT DFIR focus, 15% role examples, 10%
  NIST direct quotes. Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''type'': ''mcq|qa|cloze'', ''bloom'':
