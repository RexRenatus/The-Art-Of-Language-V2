        "core_logic": "NIST SP 800-84 stresses that the true value of an exercise lies in its evaluation and the subsequent implementation of corrective actions. A robust evaluation identifies gaps, and a clear action plan ensures these gaps are addressed, driving continuous improvement.",

        "analogy": "Completing a tabletop exercise without evaluation and action planning is like finishing a practice exam without reviewing the answers; you miss the opportunity to learn and improve."
