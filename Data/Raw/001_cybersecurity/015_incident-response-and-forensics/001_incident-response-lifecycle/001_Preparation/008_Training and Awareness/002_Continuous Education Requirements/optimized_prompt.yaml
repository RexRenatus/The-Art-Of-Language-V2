active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the role of continuous education in each phase of the NIST SP 800-61 Incident Response Lifecycle
    (Preparation, Detection/Analysis, Containment/Eradication/Recovery, Post-Incident Activity). Which phase benefits most
    from ongoing training, and why? Support your argument with examples from real-world breaches.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - '3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''No CPE needed post-certification''), 1) Plausible but partial
      truth (e.g., ''40 CPEs/year for CISSP'' – actually min but total 120/3yrs), 1) Extreme/unrealistic (e.g., ''1000 hours/year'').'
    - 'Base on voter priorities/misconceptions: e.g., confuse initial vs. continuous training.'
    - Ensure distractors teach via elimination (explanation covers why wrong).

  **Completed Research Context:**

  Continuous education in IR/Forensics keeps skills current amid evolving threats. Core Concepts: IR (detect/respond per NIST
  800-61), Forensics (evidence handling), Continuous Education (CPE via training/certs). Standards: NIST SP 800-61 r3 (Preparation
  training, https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/61/r3/final); (ISC)² CISSP (120 CPEs/3yrs, https://www.isc2.org/cpe); GIAC (36
  CEUs/4yrs, https://www.giac.org/continuing-education/); ISO 27001 Cl.7.2 (competence, https://www.iso.org/standard/27001);
  CIS Controls v8 Safeguard 7 (https://www.cisecurity.org/controls); NIST CSF 2.0 (Govern: Awareness training). Sources: NIST,
  (ISC)², GIAC, ISO, CIS.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list from above].

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full scaffolding from above]. Prerequisite: Link initial training (014) to continuous.

  **Active Learning:** [Insert full active learning from above] – reference in flashcards.


  **Flashcard Generation Rules:**

  - Balance: 10-15 cards/layer, span Bloom''s (Remember 20%, Understand 20%, Apply 20%, Analyze 15%, Evaluate 15%, Create
  10%).

  - Use schema: Front (MCQ/cloze/short), Back (Answer | Explanation | Reference | Layer | Active Link).

  - Distractors: [Insert distractor protocol].

  - Make engaging: Use scenarios, avoid rote; explanations scaffold to higher layers.

  - Output JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''reference'': ''...'',
  ''layer'': ''1'', ''active_link'': ''Discussion prompt''}}].
