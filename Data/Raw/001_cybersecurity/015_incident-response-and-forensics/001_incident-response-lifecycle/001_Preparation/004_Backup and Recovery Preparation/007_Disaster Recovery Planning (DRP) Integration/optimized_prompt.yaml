  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the optimal timing for activating DRP within the IR lifecycle during a simulated ransomware attack.
    Use NIST SP 800-61 to support arguments, considering forensics outcomes and misconceptions that DRP replaces IR. Divide
    into teams: one arguing for early activation (post-detection), the other for late (post-forensics).'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Core Content (from NIST SP 800-184 ''Guide for Cybersecurity Event Recovery'', NIST SP 800-61 ''Incident Handling'', balbix.com):
  DRP restores IT post-incident (subset of BCP); integrates post-IR eradication using forensics evidence; key phases: preparation
  (backups), recovery strategies (RTO/RPO), validation. Sources: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/184, https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/61/r2,
