learning_objectives:
  understand:
  - objective: Explain the role of offsite backups in ransomware resistance, business continuity, and disaster recovery.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  evaluate:
  - objective: Assess a provided backup plan against NIST Cybersecurity Framework subcategory PR.IP-4 (Backups of information
      are conducted, maintained, and tested) and recommend improvements.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  analyze:
  - objective: Compare physical vs. cloud offsite backups in terms of cost, security, recovery time objective (RTO), and compliance
      requirements.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  create:
  - objective: Design a customized offsite backup strategy for a mid-sized organization, incorporating the 3-2-1 rule, encryption,
      air-gapping, and regular testing.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  remember:
  - objective: Define offsite backup storage and list the full components of the 3-2-1 backup rule (3 copies of data on 2
      different types of media, with at least 1 copy offsite or off-network).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Given a scenario, select appropriate offsite storage solutions (e.g., physical tape vs. cloud) based on organizational
      needs.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Offsite Backup Storage''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response Lifecycle > 001_Preparation
  > 010_Backup and 005_Recovery > Offsite Backup Storage). Use the provided research context: Offsite backups protect against
  ransomware, disasters; full 3-2-1 rule (3 copies, 2 media, 1 offsite/off-network); NIST PR.IP-4; best practices (encryption,
  testing, air-gapping, immutable storage); sources (objectfirst.com, ncsc.gov.uk, nist.gov, turnkeysol.com).


  Incorporate university pedagogy: Align flashcards to these LEARNING OBJECTIVES [insert learning_objectives JSON]. Include
  ACTIVE LEARNING ties (e.g., explanations referencing discussion on Colonial Pipeline ransomware or hospital scenario) [insert
  active_learning_components JSON]. Scaffold across 4 LAYERS [insert scaffolding_layers JSON].


  Generate flashcards per FLASHCARD SCHEMA [insert flashcard_generation_schema JSON], ensuring distractors follow the protocol.
  Balance for spaced repetition: mix recall, application, analysis.


  Output ONLY a valid JSON array of 40 flashcards. Each card must reference its Bloom''s level, layer, and a source. Ensure
  content is accurate, complete (e.g., full 3-2-1 rule), and engaging for incident response preparation.'
