        "core_logic": "CP-9(3) mandates storing critical backup copies separately (e.g., offsite or in a fire-rated container) because this isolation protects them from localized disasters or attacks (like ransomware) that could simultaneously affect the primary system and its collocated backups, thereby ensuring availability for recovery.",
