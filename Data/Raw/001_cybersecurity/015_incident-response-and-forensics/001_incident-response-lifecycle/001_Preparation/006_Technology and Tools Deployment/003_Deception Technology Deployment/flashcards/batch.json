        "core_logic": "The evolution of deception technology has moved from low-interaction, easily detectable decoys to high-interaction systems that more closely mimic real environments. Because attackers have become more sophisticated, modern deception must be more convincing to be effective in attracting and analyzing their behavior.",

        "analogy": "Early deception tech was like a simple scarecrow; modern deception tech is like a realistic animatronic figure that moves and reacts, much harder to dismiss as fake."
