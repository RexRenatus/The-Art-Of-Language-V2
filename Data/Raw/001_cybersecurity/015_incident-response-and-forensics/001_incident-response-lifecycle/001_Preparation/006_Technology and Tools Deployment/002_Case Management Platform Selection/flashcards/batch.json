      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Customization and configuration flexibility are important because they allow an organization to adapt the platform to its unique incident response procedures, terminology, and reporting requirements. This ensures the tool effectively supports, rather than hinders, the team's operations, because a one-size-fits-all approach is rarely optimal.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors misinterpret customization as modifying source code, enabling impossible integrations, or bypassing security, which are not the intended benefits of flexible configuration.",
        "analogy": "It's like choosing a modular furniture set; you can arrange and configure the pieces (fields, workflows) to perfectly fit your room (incident response process) and needs."
