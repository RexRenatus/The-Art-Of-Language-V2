        "core_logic": "Vertical escalation moves an incident up the organizational hierarchy (e.g., from Tier 1 support to management), typically due to severity or lack of resolution. Horizontal escalation involves bringing in parallel teams (e.g., Legal, PR, specific security sub-teams) to address different facets of the incident.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly associate escalation types with issue domains, assume speed differences, or impose geographic limitations, failing to grasp the core distinction between moving up management levels versus engaging parallel expertise.",
        "analogy": "Vertical escalation is like calling your boss's boss when your manager can't solve a problem. Horizontal escalation is like calling the HR department, the legal team, and the PR department for help on the same complex issue."

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The preparation phase is about establishing the framework for incident response *before* an incident happens.
