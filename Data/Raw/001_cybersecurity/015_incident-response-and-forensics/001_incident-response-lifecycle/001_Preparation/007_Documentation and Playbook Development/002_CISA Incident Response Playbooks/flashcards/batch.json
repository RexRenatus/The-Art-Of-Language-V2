        "core_logic": "Clearly defined roles and responsibilities are fundamental because they ensure that critical tasks are assigned, accountability is established, and decision-making processes are streamlined, especially under pressure.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Roles are for effective action and accountability, not blame, overly prescriptive technical detail, or limiting participation.",
        "analogy": "Defining roles is like assigning positions on a sports team (e.g., quarterback, defender); each player knows their job, leading to better teamwork and performance."
