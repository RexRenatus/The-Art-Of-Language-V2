  Core Content: NIST RMF (SP 800-37r2) is a flexible process integrating security/privacy risk management into SDLC. Seven
  steps: 1.Prepare (prep activities), 2.Categorize (system risks), 3.Select (controls), 4.Implement (controls), 5.Assess (effectiveness),
  6.Authorize (risk acceptance), 7.Monitor (continuous). Emphasizes continuous monitoring, cATO, risk-based decisions. Links
  to asset inventory, incident response prep.
