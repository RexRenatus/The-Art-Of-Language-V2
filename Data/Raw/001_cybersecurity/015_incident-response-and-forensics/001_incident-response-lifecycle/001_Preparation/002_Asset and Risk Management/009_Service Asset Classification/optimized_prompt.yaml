active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the consequences of misclassifying a customer database as a non-service
    asset during an incident response scenario. How does this impact prioritization and forensics? Reference NIST standards
    to support your arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
