active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a ransomware attack on a healthcare organization with limited resources, debate how to prioritize
    mission-essential functions (e.g., patient care vs. billing systems) using real NIST CSF examples and BIA principles.
    Consider financial, operational, reputational, and safety impacts.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these Learning Objectives [insert learning_objectives array]; Active Learning components [insert active_learning
  object] for contextual depth; Scaffolding Layers [insert scaffolding object] for progression.


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards using the exact Flashcard Schema [insert flashcard_schema object]. Ensure comprehensive
  coverage: Balance Bloom''s levels and layers; Integrate voter priorities (e.g., NIST CSF Identify, RTO/RPO, healthcare/retail
  scenarios); Use research context (BIA definition [guidepointsecurity.com], mission functions [csrc.nist.gov], NISTIR 8286
  templates, NIST CSF full ''Identify'' role in BCM/IRM).
