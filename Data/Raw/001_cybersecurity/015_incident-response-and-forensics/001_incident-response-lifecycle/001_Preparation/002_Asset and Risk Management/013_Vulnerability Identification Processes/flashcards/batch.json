        "core_logic": "Continuous monitoring is essential because the threat landscape and system configurations change constantly; therefore, ongoing assessment allows for the near real-time detection of new vulnerabilities or changes that reintroduce risks.",

        "analogy": "Continuous monitoring is like having security guards patrolling a building 24/7, rather than just checking the locks once a week, to catch any new threats or breaches immediately."
