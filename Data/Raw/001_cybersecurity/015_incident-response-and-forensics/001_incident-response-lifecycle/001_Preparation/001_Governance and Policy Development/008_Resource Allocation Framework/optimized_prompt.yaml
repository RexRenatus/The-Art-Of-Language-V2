active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given limited budgets, should organizations prioritize automated tools or skilled personnel for incident
    response preparation? Debate using NIST CSF 2.0 Respond (RS) and Recover (RC) functions, considering trade-offs in speed
    vs. thoroughness. Reference governance policies from the Preparation subdomain.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse Preparation with Response phase).
    - Non-examples (e.g., Equifax poor allocation as 'correct').
    - Partial truths (e.g., correct framework but wrong function).
    - Over-generalizations (e.g., 'always prioritize tools over personnel').
    - '3 distractors per MCQ: 1 superficially similar, 1 opposite, 1 unrelated.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom''s Taxonomy, active
  learning, and scaffolding. Generate 40 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Resource Allocation Framework'' (hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response Lifecycle > 001_Preparation > Governance and
  Policy Development > Resource Allocation Framework).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the 6 objectives above].

  - Active Learning: Weave in discussion (budget trade-offs), peer teaching (components), problem-solving (phishing scenario,
  SolarWinds).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute across 4 layers [paste scaffolding content].

  - Ensure coverage: 67.1% voter-approved completeness (NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 full integration, sources included).


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly:

  Output as JSON array of objects, each with ''front'', ''back'' {answer, explanation, bloom_level, scaffolding_layer, distractors[]},
  ''metadata''.

  Distractors: Strictly follow protocol (plausible misconceptions, non-examples like Equifax).

  Variety: 24 MCQs (1 correct + 3 distractors explained), 16 short answer. Balance: 10 Remember/Understand (Layers 1-2), 15
  Apply/Analyze (Layer 3), 15 Evaluate/Create (Layer 4). Include concept map elements and real-world cases.

  Make explanations pedagogical: Link to objectives, suggest active learning tie-in (e.g., ''Discuss in peer teaching'').
