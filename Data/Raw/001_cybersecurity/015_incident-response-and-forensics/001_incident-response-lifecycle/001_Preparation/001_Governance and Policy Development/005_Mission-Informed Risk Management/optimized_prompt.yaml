active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one partner teaches the four risk management stages (Identification, Evaluation, Control, Assessment)
    with examples/non-examples (e.g., phishing risk vs. physical theft); the other quizzes and provides feedback. Switch roles
    after 5 minutes, linking to NIST SP 800-61 Preparation phase.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A small business detects ransomware encrypting mission-critical data. In teams of 3-4, assess
    mission impact using risk stages, design integrated controls/policy per NIST CSF Govern/Identify and IR Lifecycle Preparation,
    then present and peer-review solutions.'
