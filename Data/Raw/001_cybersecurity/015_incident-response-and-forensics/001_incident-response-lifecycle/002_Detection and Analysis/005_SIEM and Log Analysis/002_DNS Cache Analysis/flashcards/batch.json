        "core_logic": "DNS tunneling is a concern because it abuses the ubiquitous nature of DNS to bypass security controls for data exfiltration or C2, since DNS traffic is often allowed through firewalls. This functions as a covert channel by encoding non-DNS data within legitimate DNS protocol elements.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors describe legitimate DNS functions like optimization, secure updates, or load balancing, failing to identify DNS tunneling as a covert malicious technique.",
