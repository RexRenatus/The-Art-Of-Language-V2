active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between real-time Syslog analysis in SIEM for rapid detection versus detailed forensic
    analysis post-incident, using NIST SP 800-92 as reference. Consider factors like false positives, resource usage, and
    compliance (e.g., ACSC Guidance).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
