  discussion_prompt: 'In a class discussion, debate the statement: ''Third-party notifications are less critical than internal
    events because organizations lack direct control.'' Use examples like Log4j supply chain attacks to support arguments,
    addressing misconceptions about underestimating supply chain risks.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    common misconception (e.g., ''Ignore if vendor handles it''), 1 related but incorrect term (e.g., confuse TPRM with internal
    IR), 1 extreme/overgeneralized (e.g., ''Always terminate contract''). Explain why distractors are wrong on Back.'

  Use this structured content to generate high-quality, spaced-repetition-optimized flashcards:


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the learning_objectives array here]


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the scaffolding object here]


  **Active Learning Context:** Draw from discussions/problem-solving for scenario-based cards (e.g., Log4Shell vendor notification).


  **Sources:** NIST SP 800-61, NISTIR 8428 (DFIR framework), IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report (panorays.com/securityscorecard.com),
  DORA (EU Digital Operational Resilience Act: ict-incident reporting, third-party resilience - ec.europa.eu), ISACA.org (Incident
  Commander), real-world: SolarWinds/Log4j attacks.


  Generate 75 flashcards per the schema: Vary types (recall, MCQ with distractors, apply scenarios). Ensure active recall
  (questions prompt retrieval). Cover all Bloom''s levels proportionally, all scaffolding layers. Align with pedagogy: Scaffolding
  builds from foundation to integration; reference voter priorities (e.g., steps, comparisons, TPRM links).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards in exact schema format. No extra text.'
