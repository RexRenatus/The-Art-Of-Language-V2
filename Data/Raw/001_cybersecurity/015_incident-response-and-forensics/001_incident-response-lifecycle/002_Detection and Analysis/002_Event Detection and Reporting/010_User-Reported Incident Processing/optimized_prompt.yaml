active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a resource-constrained SOC, should user-reported incidents always take priority over automated alerts?
    Debate pros, cons, and triage strategies using NIST SP 800-61 guidelines. Consider factors like false positives, user
    training, and early threat detection.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ (40% of cards): 4 options (1 correct, 3 distractors). Distractors must be plausible: (1) Common
    misconceptions (e.g., ''User reports always low priority''), (2) Related but incorrect terms (e.g., confuse triage with
    escalation), (3) Partial truths (e.g., NIST phase wrong), (4) Edge cases (e.g., non-security reports). Ensure no giveaways;
    rotate correct position.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Incident Response. Topic:
  User-Reported Incident Processing (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response
  Lifecycle > 002_Detection and Analysis > Event Detection and Reporting > User-Reported Incident Processing).


  Research Context: User-reported incidents are end-user alerts (phishing, suspicious emails, lost devices) critical for early
  detection. Process per NIST SP 800-61 r3 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r3.pdf): Intake
  → Triage → Validation → Prioritization → Escalation → Documentation. Integrates into IR lifecycle (Preparation: train users;
  Detection/Analysis: process reports; etc.). Sources: NIST SP 800-61 r3; NISTIR 8428 (Cybersecurity Framework profiles, emphasizing
  reporting in risk mgmt).
