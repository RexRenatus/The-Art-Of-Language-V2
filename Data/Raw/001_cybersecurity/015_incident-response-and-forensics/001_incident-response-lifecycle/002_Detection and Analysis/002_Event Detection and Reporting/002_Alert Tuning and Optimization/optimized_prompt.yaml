  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one partner explains the step-by-step alert tuning process using SIEM examples (e.g., threshold
    adjustment); the other teaches back by creating and presenting a self-generated tuning scenario.
  problem_solving: 'Given a simulated alert log dataset (e.g., 100 alerts with labels: 20 true positives, 80 false positives),
    tune thresholds to optimize true positive rate while reducing false positives by 50%. Calculate and compare pre- and post-tuning
    precision/recall.'

  **Learning Objectives** (span all levels): [INSERT learning_objectives array here]


  **Active Learning Tie-Ins**: Incorporate prompts referencing discussions (e.g., trade-offs), peer teaching (e.g., explain
  steps), problem-solving (e.g., dataset analysis).


  **Scaffolding Content** (use verbatim for accuracy): [INSERT full scaffolding object here]


  **Flashcard Schema** (output ONLY valid JSON array of 30 flashcards): [INSERT flashcard_schema.structure and rules here]


  Generate flashcards covering all objectives/layers. Ensure explanations reference sources (prophetsecurity.ai, cisa.gov,
  nist.gov), prior knowledge (SIEM basics), and best practices (baselining, thresholds, etc.). Vary types: 50% MCQ (with distractors),
  30% Cloze, 20% Short Answer. Promote active recall. Output: {"flashcards": [array of objects]}.'
