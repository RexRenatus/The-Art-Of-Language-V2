  discussion_prompt: 'In groups of 3-4, debate the potential consequences of incomplete or delayed event report submission
    during a real-world incident like the SolarWinds supply chain attack. Reference NIST CSF 2.0 Respond functions (e.g.,
    RS.RP-01: Response plan execution) and propose mitigation strategies. (20 minutes; share key insights with class).'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Incident Response. Generate
  30 high-quality flashcards for ''Event Report Submission Processes'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And

  Submission Processes).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste the 6 objectives above].

  - Scaffolding Layers: [Paste the 4 layers above].

  - Active Learning: Inspire questions from discussion/peer/problem-solving (e.g., scenario-based).

  - Prerequisites: Link to event detection.

  - Research: NIST SP 800-61r3 (documentation emphasis), CSF 2.0 Respond (RS.AN/RS.RP/RS.CO), definitions (event/incident/report).

  - Voters: Include templates/checklists, concept map, SMART objectives.


  Use exact Flashcard Schema: JSON array of objects with ''front'' and ''back'' (as specified). Ensure active recall (questions
  test retrieval), spaced repetition friendly (concise), distractors per protocol. Cover Bloom''s progression. Output ONLY
  the JSON array, e.g., [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}}, ...]. No extra text.'
