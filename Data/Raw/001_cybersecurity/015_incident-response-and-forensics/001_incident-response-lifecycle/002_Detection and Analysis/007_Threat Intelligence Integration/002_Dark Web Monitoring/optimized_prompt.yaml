active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of incident response, debate whether organizations should invest in proactive dark web
    monitoring versus reactive measures post-breach. Consider costs, ethics, effectiveness, and NIST framework examples (e.g.,
    Preparation, Detection phases).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    deep web''), 2) Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Monitoring only detects breaches after they occur''), 3) Irrelevant/confusable
    term (e.g., mix up tools like ''Tor browser'' as a monitoring tool). Ensure distractors test subtle understanding.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate high-quality Anki-style flashcards
  for the topic ''Dark Web Monitoring'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response
  Lifecycle > 002_Detection and Analysis > 005_Threat Intelligence Integration > Dark Web Monitoring). Use university pedagogy:
  Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives, active learning, 4-layer scaffolding.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the learning_objectives array here].

  **Active Learning:** Incorporate ties to [discussion_prompt], [peer_teaching_activity], [problem_solving_exercise] in explanations.

  **Scaffolding:** Distribute cards across [layer1_foundation], [layer2_components], [layer3_implementation], [layer4_integration].
  Tag each card with layer and Bloom''s level.

  **Content Sources:** Research context (Dark Web via Tor; monitoring for leaks/CTI/TTPs; tools: DarkOwl, Flashpoint; NIST
  IR Lifecycle focus on Detection; IRP integration; misconceptions: dark web vs deep web). Prior knowledge: Surface/Deep/Dark
  Web, threat intel basics.


  **Output Format:** JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''references'': ''...'', ''active_learning_tie_in'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''1'', ''blooms_level'': ''REMEMBER''}, ''tags'':
  [''dark-web'', ''nist'']}, ...]. Follow [flashcard_schema] exactly: MCQs with 4 options on front, distractors protocol strictly.
  Ensure 20-30 cards, progressive difficulty, measurable recall/application.
