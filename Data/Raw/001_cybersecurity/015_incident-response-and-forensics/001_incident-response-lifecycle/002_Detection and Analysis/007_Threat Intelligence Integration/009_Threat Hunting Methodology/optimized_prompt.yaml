active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the value of proactive threat hunting versus relying solely on automated
    SIEM alerts. Use examples from MITRE ATT&CK to support how hunting addresses 'unknown unknowns' and links to prior knowledge
    in Incident Response Lifecycle (Detection and Analysis). Evaluate potential challenges in a real-world SOC.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Use this optimized learning framework:


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list from above]


  **Active Learning:** Incorporate elements into explanations (e.g., ''Discusses in peer teaching'').


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full scaffolding from above] – Distribute cards evenly across layers.


  **Flashcard Schema:** [Insert full schema from above] – Output mix of basic (30%), cloze (30%), MCQ (40%).


  **Content Sources:** Draw from provided research: Core concepts (proactive/human-driven hunting, MITRE ATT&CK), methodologies
  (hypothesis-driven, entity-driven, intelligence-driven, data-driven, Extended Hunting Loop), best practices (close gaps,
  SOC integration), sources (pylos.co, sans.org, hodigital.blog.gov.uk).


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards. Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''basic|cloze|mcq'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'':
  ''...'', ''blooms_level'': ''REMEMBER|etc'', ''layer'': 1-4, ''explanation'': ''...''}]. Ensure cards progress from foundation
  to integration, promote active recall, and avoid truncation.'
