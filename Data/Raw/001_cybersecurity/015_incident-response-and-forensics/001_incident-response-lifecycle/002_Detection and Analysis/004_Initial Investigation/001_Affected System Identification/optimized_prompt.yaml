active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges of identifying affected systems in a hybrid cloud-on-premises
    environment. Consider factors like lateral movement indicators and false positives. How does this differ from on-premises-only
    incidents? Propose mitigation strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''All systems showing
    traffic are affected'' vs. only those with IOCs); 2) Partial truths (e.g., valid for other phases); 3) Overgeneralizations
    (e.g., ignoring cloud specifics); 4) Voter-noted errors (e.g., NIST doc confusion). Ensure one is the most tempting.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Incident Response. Topic:
  ''Affected System Identification'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response
