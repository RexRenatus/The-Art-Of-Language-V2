active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a real-world breach like SolarWinds, what challenges arise when constructing an attack timeline from
    multiple log sources (e.g., network, host, application, OT systems)? Debate the trade-offs between speed and completeness
    during initial investigation, addressing misconceptions like assuming uniform timestamps across sources.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Common misconceptions (e.g., 'Timestamps are always UTC' vs. reality of time zone issues)
    - Similar terms/concepts (e.g., 'forensic timeline' vs. 'super-timeline')
    - Edge cases/real-world pitfalls (e.g., ignoring OT logs in IT-focused tools)
    - Partial truths (e.g., 'Timeline construction only needs host logs' vs. multi-source correlation)
    quality: Plausible to experts but incorrect; avoid obvious errors; base on voter-noted misconceptions like uniform timestamps
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Attack Timeline Construction''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response Lifecycle > 002_Detection
  and Analysis > Initial Investigation > Attack Timeline Construction). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning
  components, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema to create high-quality, Anki-optimized flashcards.


  Incorporate:

  - Research context: Forensic timelines, NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3, NIST 800-86, tools like Plaso/log2timeline/Timesketch, OT
  DFIR challenges, best practices (multi-source correlation, timestamp normalization, visualization, prioritize volatile data).

  - Voter consensus: Complete best practices (data collection, event correlation, automation); prior knowledge (log analysis,
  detection).

  - Pedagogy: Progress through Bloom''s levels; spark critical thinking via real-world examples (SolarWinds, ransomware, OT
  incidents).


  Generate flashcards in the exact schema: Front (question with 4 options for MC), Back (answer, explanation, bloom_level,
  references, active_learning_link). Use distractor protocol strictly.


  Output as a numbered list of JSON objects, one per flashcard. Ensure comprehensive coverage: foundation terms, tools/steps,
  analysis pitfalls, integration scenarios. Prioritize measurable, active recall.'
