active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the pros and cons of signature-based versus behavior-based detection for zero-day exploits in
    a zero-trust environment. Consider real-world examples like Log4Shell or SolarWinds, and evaluate their impact on incident
    response timelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Signature-based detects
    zero-days'' instead of behavioral); 2) Partial truth (e.g., ''Patch management'' for detection, not prevention); 3) Non-example
    (e.g., ''Known CVE with signature''). Ensure distractors test nuance (e.g., vulnerability vs. exploit).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Zero-Day Exploit Detection
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response Lifecycle > 002_Detection
  and Analysis > Specialized Detection Methods > Zero-Day Exploit Detection). Use the provided research context: Zero-days
  are unknown vulnerabilities/exploits/attacks (sources: deepstrike.io, indusface.com, securityscorecard.com, phishprotection.com).
  Detection relies on behavioral analysis, anomaly detection, ML, threat intel, sandboxing, EDR/SIEM. Frameworks: MITRE ATT&CK
  (e.g., T1190, T1203), NIST CSF. Big picture: Detection phase of IR lifecycle, proactive vs. reactive.


  Incorporate pedagogy: Learning objectives [insert list above]; Active learning [insert activities]; Scaffolding layers [insert
  layers]; Voter priorities (Bloom''s progression, misconceptions, prerequisites like signature vs. behavior).

  Ensure cards progress scaffolding (tag by layer/Bloom), use precise verbs, web-grounded (cite sources), distractors per
  protocol. Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''references'': [...], ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...''}}, ...]. Make engaging, assessable, optimized
