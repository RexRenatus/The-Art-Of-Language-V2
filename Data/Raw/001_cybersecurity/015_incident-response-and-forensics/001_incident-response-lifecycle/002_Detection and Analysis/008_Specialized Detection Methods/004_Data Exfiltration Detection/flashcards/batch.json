      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "A CASB with DLP is most effective because it specifically monitors and controls access to cloud services, inspecting data in motion to detect exfiltration. This functions by integrating with cloud platforms to enforce security policies, including content inspection for sensitive data.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors represent less effective controls: traditional IDS struggles with encrypted cloud traffic, EDR focuses on endpoints, and firewall logs lack the granularity for cloud service-specific data exfiltration.",
        "analogy": "A CASB is like a specialized security guard at the entrance to a secure facility (cloud services) who checks all packages (data) being moved in or out, whereas EDR is like a guard inside individual offices."
