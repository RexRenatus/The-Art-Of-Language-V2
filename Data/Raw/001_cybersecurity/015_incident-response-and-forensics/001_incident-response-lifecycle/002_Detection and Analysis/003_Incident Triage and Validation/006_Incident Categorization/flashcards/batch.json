        "core_logic": "Combining incident type with severity allows for a more nuanced categorization. For example, a 'malware' incident might be low severity on a workstation but high severity if it affects critical servers. This matrix approach, informed by NIST guidelines, provides a baseline that can be adapted to specific circumstances.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly suggest type and severity are independent, that their relationship is strictly one-way, or that typing is only relevant for high-severity events, ignoring the synergistic use for effective categorization.",
