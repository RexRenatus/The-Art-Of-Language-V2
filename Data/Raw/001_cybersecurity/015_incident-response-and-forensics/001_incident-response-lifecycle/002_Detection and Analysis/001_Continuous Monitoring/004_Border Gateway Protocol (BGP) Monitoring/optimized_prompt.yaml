  - 'Generate 3 distractors for MCQs: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse BMP with SNMP), 2) Partial truth (e.g., wrong
    RFC number), 3) Extreme/plausible error (e.g., invalid command syntax).'
  - Ensure one distractor is a frequent real-world mix-up (e.g., BGP port 179 vs. BMP port).
  - 'Base on research: NIST hijacking examples, RFC 7854 details.'
  - 'Balance: 40% QA/Cloze for recall, 60% MCQ for analysis.'

  Content Sources:

  - Core: BGP (path-vector, AS/ASN), hijacking risks, RFC 7854 BMP (route views), RPKI/ROV.

  - Best Practices: Cisco ''router bgp ASN bmp-server IP port'', monitor anomalies/alerts, tools (BGPmon, Kentik), SIEM integration.

  - Connections: Prerequisites (OSI L3, TCP/IP); Related (SIEM/logs); Cross-domain (cloud); Real-world (2021 Facebook leak);
  Big Picture (IR preparation).


  Ensure university pedagogy: Cover all Bloom levels progressively. Flashcards promote active recall, spaced repetition. Output
  ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects. No extra text.'
