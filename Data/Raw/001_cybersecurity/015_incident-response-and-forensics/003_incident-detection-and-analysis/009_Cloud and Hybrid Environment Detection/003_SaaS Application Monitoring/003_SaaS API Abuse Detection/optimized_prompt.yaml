active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the effectiveness of rate limiting versus behavioral analytics (e.g., using ML baselines) for
    detecting SaaS API abuse. Consider trade-offs in false positives, scalability in hybrid environments, and real-world examples
    like Twilio API DoS attacks. Support arguments with NIST SP 800-228 or CSA guidelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''API injection''
    instead of ''business logic abuse''); 2) Partial truths (e.g., valid API feature misapplied); 3) Real-world confusions
    (e.g., Twilio DoS as ''credential stuffing''); 4) Edge cases from standards (e.g., NIST vs. CSA differences). Ensure distractors
    teach by contrast.'

  - Active Learning: Inspire cards that support discussions (e.g., rate limiting vs. ML), peer teaching (abuse types), problem-solving
  (log analysis).

  - Research Context: Core concepts (SaaS API abuse: data exfil/DoS/credential stuffing; NIST SP 800-228 API protection, SP
  800-210 access control; CSA API Security Guidance: runtime monitoring/logging; examples: Okta credential stuffing, Twilio
  DoS; sources: https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-228/final, https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-210/final,
