active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In hybrid environments, debate whether increasing AAL from 1 to 3 significantly reduces incident risks,
    using NIST SP 800-63B as reference. Consider trade-offs in usability vs. security, common misconceptions like MFA being
    infallible, and real-world examples like MFA fatigue attacks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Active Learning: Use discussion/peer/problem-solving to inspire cards (e.g., anomaly detection scenarios).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers: [insert full scaffolding above].


  Use provided research context: MFA factors, AALs (NIST SP 800-63B), federation, hybrid correlation (AD/Entra ID), MFA fatigue
  (MITRE T1621). Ensure accuracy (SP 800-63-3 current; 800-63-4 draft).


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly:

  Output ONLY a JSON array of 50 flashcards, each as: {"front": "...", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "bloom_level":
  "...", "scaffolding_layer": "...", "active_recall_tip": "..."}}. Balance: 20% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 30% APPLY/ANALYZE, 50%
  EVALUATE/CREATE. Include diagrams as text descriptions (e.g., ''Pyramid: Know-Have-Are''). Promote active recall, combat
  misconceptions.'
