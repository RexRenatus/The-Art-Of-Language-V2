active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the unique challenges of cloud storage access monitoring compared to on-premises
    environments (e.g., multi-tenancy, provider dependency). Reference NIST SP 800-201 and propose two mitigation strategies,
    justifying their effectiveness using real-world examples like the Capital One AWS breach.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: (1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Logs auto-enabled'' vs. manual), (2) Partial
      truth (e.g., ''IP only'' vs. full fields), (3) Related but wrong concept (e.g., ''Metrics'' vs. ''Logs'').'
    - Ensure distractors are 70% plausible to high performers, based on voter priorities (e.g., incomplete logging fields).
    - Avoid 'all/none' options; balance difficulty by Bloom's level.
