active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a cloud breach like the Capital One incident, how could enhanced API monitoring have detected anomalous
    activity earlier? Debate the trade-offs between monitoring depth (e.g., full API logs) and performance overhead in production
    environments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
