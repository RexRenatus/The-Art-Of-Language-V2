  discussion_prompt: To what extent do webinjects make banking Trojans more dangerous than other credential stealers? Debate
    the pros and cons of signature-based vs. behavioral detection, citing evolving techniques like process injection and obfuscation
    in families such as Zeus and Emotet.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, Student A teaches process injection by drawing the infection chain (e.g., malicious code into svchost.exe)
    and key indicators; Student B teaches webinjects by simulating HTML alteration on a banking site. Switch roles, then quiz
    each other on differences and real-world examples from TrickBot or Dridex.
  problem_solving: Given log excerpts (e.g., suspicious svchost.exe child process injection, browser hooks to C2 domains,
    webinject artifacts), classify as banking Trojan (e.g., Qakbot), outline step-by-step forensic identification (static/dynamic
    analysis), map to MITRE ATT&CK (TA0004 Privilege Escalation, T1055), and recommend containment steps.
