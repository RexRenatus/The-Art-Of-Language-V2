        "core_logic": "RaaS democratizes ransomware attacks by providing ready-made tools and infrastructure, thus increasing the number of actors capable of launching attacks and diversifying their methods. This complexity challenges traditional defenses and requires more sophisticated incident response capabilities, as observed in threat landscape analyses.",

        "analogy": "RaaS is like a 'build-your-own-weapon' kit for criminals; it makes it easier for anyone to assemble and deploy a dangerous tool, increasing the frequency and variety of attacks."
