active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a ransomware attack on a financial institution, debate whether indirect costs like downtime revenue
    loss or direct costs like ransom payments typically have the greater long-term financial impact. Support your position
    with real-world examples from NIST case studies and quantify using sample formulas.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Financial impact = technical CVSS
    score''); 2) Partial truth (e.g., direct costs only); 3) Calculation error (e.g., wrong formula like revenue × RPO instead
    of downtime). Ensure plausible for experts (e.g., swap indirect for direct). Vary difficulty by Bloom''s level.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Incident Response and Forensics.
  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on ''Financial Impact Calculation'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response
  And Forensics > Incident 002_Detection and Analysis > 014_Incident Analysis Techniques > Scope and Impact Analysis > Financial
  Impact Calculation).


  Incorporate this synthesized content:

  - Research Context: BIA (NISTIR 8286D), ERM/CSRM integration, IRP, NIST CSF 2.0. Costs: Direct (recovery, ransom), Indirect
  (downtime = hourly revenue × hours, reputation), Fines. Best Practices: Quantify via TCO/RTO/RPO; integrate into risk mgmt;
  avoid qualitative-only.

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Scaffolding: [insert full 4 layers above].

  - Active Learning Ties: Reference where relevant.

  - Voter Priorities: Formulas, steps, misconceptions, concept map.


  Use exact Flashcard Schema: Front (question), Back (answer::explanation::distractors if MCQ::active tie). Ensure Bloom''s
  progression, scaffolding coverage, distractors per protocol. Output as numbered list in Anki format (e.g., 1. Front::Back).
  Make engaging, precise, educational.'
