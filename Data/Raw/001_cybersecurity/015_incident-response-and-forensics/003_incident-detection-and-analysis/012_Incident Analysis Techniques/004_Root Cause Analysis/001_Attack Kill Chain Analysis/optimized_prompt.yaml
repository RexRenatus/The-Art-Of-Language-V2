  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use concepts from discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving to inspire scenario flashcards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers: [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM ABOVE].

  - Ensure completeness: Cover 7 CKC stages fully (Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, C2,
  Actions on Objectives), APTs, defenses per stage, MITRE ATT&CK comparisons (e.g., CKC Recon to ATT&CK Reconnaissance TA0043),
  other frameworks (Diamond Model, Unified Kill Chain), real-world cases (SolarWinds, APT28), concept map (central CKC node
  → stages → defenses → MITRE links).


  Follow this Flashcard Schema exactly: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD SCHEMA FROM ABOVE].


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards in valid JSON array format. Balance: 10 Layer 1, 12 Layer 2, 13 Layer 3, 15 Layer 4.
  Vary question types for active recall. Explanations must be educational, tying to Bloom''s progression and voter priorities
  (pedagogy, completeness, scaffolding).


  Output ONLY the JSON array, no additional text.'
