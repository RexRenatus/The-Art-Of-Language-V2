active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how attackers might abuse cron jobs for persistence (e.g., backdoor scheduling)
    and evaluate the forensic value of /var/log/cron in reconstructing such attacks. Reference real-world examples like APT
    campaigns and NIST SP 800-92 recommendations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Plausible alternatives: Similar log paths (e.g., /var/log/auth.log vs. /var/log/cron)'
    - 'Common misconceptions: Confuse syslog with cron-specific (distractor: logs only in /etc/cron.d)'
    - 'Edge cases: Valid but anomalous patterns (e.g., user ''nobody'' vs. ''root'')'
    - 'Frequency: 3 distractors per card, 1 always correct; balance across Bloom''s levels'
    - 'Avoid: Obvious wrongs; ensure 20-30% trickiness for analysis/evaluation cards'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education on ''Cron Job Execution Logs'' (Topic Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Incident 002_Detection and Analysis > 002_Log Management and Analysis
  > Linux/Unix Log Analysis > Cron Job Execution Logs). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities,
  4 scaffolding layers, and flashcard schema to create high-quality, pedagogically optimized flashcards.


  Incorporate:

  - Voter priorities: Log locations (/var/log/cron, syslog), samples (normal/anomalous), best practices (rotation, alerting,
  NIST SP 800-92).

  - Prerequisites: Basic Linux (grep, tail).

  - Research: Cron as scheduler, log mgmt for forensics/compliance.


  Generate flashcards following the exact schema: Multiple-choice with 4 options, detailed back explanations tying to Bloom''s
  levels/layers/objectives/sources. Apply distractor protocol strictly.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 75 flashcards, each as: {"front": "Question...", "options": ["A...", ...], "back": {"correct_answer":
  "A", "explanation": "...", "related_objective": "...", "active_tip": "...", "visual_aid": "optional"}}. Ensure progressive
  complexity: 15 Layer1, 20 Layer2, 25 Layer3, 15 Layer4. Balance Bloom''s. No extra text.'
