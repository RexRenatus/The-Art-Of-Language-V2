active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of relying on bash command history versus auditd logs for
    detecting insider threats. Use real-world examples from NIST SP 800-61 to support your arguments, and propose hybrid approaches.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Use this synthesized research context:

  ## Core Concepts

  - Command History: ~/.bash_history records user CLI commands (Bash/Zsh); recall via ''history''. Valuable for IR but editable/tamperable.

  - Shell Audit Logs: auditd framework (/var/log/audit/audit.log); captures USER_CMD, timestamps, UIDs; tamper-resistant.

  - Differences: History (user-specific, no native timestamps pre-Bash 5); Audit (system-wide, kernel-enforced).

  - Commands: ''history | grep sudo'', ''ausearch -m USER_CMD -ts recent'', ''aureport --summary'', ''tail -f /var/log/audit/audit.log''.

  - Standards: NIST SP 800-92 (log mgmt), NIST SP 800-61 (IR), NISTIR 8428 (OT/hybrid logging). Sources: man auditd, ic3.gov/CSA/2024/240822.pdf.


  Incorporate these EXACT learning objectives, active learning ideas for context, scaffolding layers as content structure,
  and flashcard schema for output.


  Generate 25 flashcards strictly following the schema: 40% Basic Q&A, 40% MCQ (with distractor protocol), 20% Application.
  Balance across Bloom''s levels (1-2 per objective) and scaffolding layers (5-7 per layer). Cover voter priorities: completeness
  (full cmds/sources), pedagogy (samples/exercises), problem-solving (scenarios).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"type": "MCQ|Basic|Application", "front": {...}, "back": {...}}. Ensure
  educational depth, no criminal assistance.'
