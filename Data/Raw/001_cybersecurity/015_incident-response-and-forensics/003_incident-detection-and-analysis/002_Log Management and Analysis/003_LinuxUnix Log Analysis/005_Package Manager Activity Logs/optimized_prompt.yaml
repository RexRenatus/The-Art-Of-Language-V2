  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains how to query apt/yum/dnf logs for suspicious packages (e.g., using grep for
    timestamps or awk for parsing), then the partner teaches it back with a 3-question quiz on sample logs.
  problem_solving: Given a mock /var/log/apt/history.log with a malicious pip install embedded (e.g., timestamped 'install
    python-malicious-package'), reconstruct the attack timeline, propose mitigations (e.g., package allowlisting), and role-play
    presenting findings to an IR team.

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use prompts to inspire scenario-based cards (e.g., ''In a debate on logging trade-offs...'').

  - Scaffolding: [PASTE FULL LAYERS FROM ABOVE] – Tag each card to a layer.

  - Research Context: Package managers (apt, yum/dnf); logs detect unauthorized installs (NIST SP 800-92); samples like ''Commandline:
  apt install malicious-pkg''; MITRE ATT&CK T1195/T1553; commands (grep, awk, journalctl).
