active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs of using Syslog versus structured logging (e.g., JSON via UDP/TCP) for forwarding
    logs from firewalls during a live incident. Which is better for high-volume threat detection and why? Reference NIST SP
    800-92 for reliability, parsing ease, and compliance. Debate in groups and vote on the optimal choice.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    vs. UDP default), 1 related but incorrect term (e.g., ''NetFlow'' for event logs), 1 edge case/non-example (e.g., ''SNMP
    for traffic volume'' vs. traps). Ensure distractors from research context/voter priorities (e.g., confuse audit/traffic
    logs).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Network Device Log Forwarding
  (Category: Cybersecurity, Domain: 002_Incident Response And Forensics, Subdomain: Incident 002_Detection and Analysis, Entry
  Domain: 002_Log Management and Analysis, Entry Subdomain: Log 003_Collection and Sources; Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_IRF
  > Incident Detection > Log Mgmt > Log Collection > Network Device Log Forwarding).


  Incorporate this research context: Network device log forwarding transmits logs (audit: user/config events; traffic: connections/patterns)
  from routers/switches/firewalls via Syslog (UDP/TCP 514, levels), NetFlow (flows), SNMP (traps) to central collectors for
  incident response/forensics (NIST SP 800-92, NCSC guidance on sources/completeness). Examples: Cisco ''logging host IP'',
  Palo Alto profiles.
