active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the most critical Windows Event ID to monitor for service-related threats
    (e.g., 7045 vs. 7036) and justify your choice based on common attacker TTPs from MITRE ATT&CK. Consider false positive
    rates and integration with NIST SP 800-61 incident detection phases.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    vs. Security), 2) Similar Event ID (e.g., 7035 vs. 7036), 3) Benign variant (e.g., legit vs. suspicious path). Ensure
    distractors teach via error (e.g., explain why wrong in back). Base on voter-noted IDs and real logs.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Windows Event Log Analysis.
  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on ''Service Creation and Modification Events'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident
  Response And Forensics > Incident 002_Detection and Analysis > 002_Log Management and Analysis > Windows Event Log Analysis
  > Service Creation and Modification Events). Integrate university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives [insert learning_objectives
  array here], active learning [insert active_learning here], scaffolding layers [insert scaffolding here].


  Key content: Focus on Event IDs 7045 (service install, System log), 7040 (start type change), 7036/7035 (control/state),
  4697 (Security log). Include XML samples, PowerShell (Get-WinEvent), tools (Event Viewer), MITRE T1543.003 persistence,
  NIST SP 800-61r2/r3 (note: r3 draft as of 2025) for IR detection. Attacker TTPs: malicious DLLs, reg changes. Sources: MS
  Docs, MITRE ATT&CK, NIST pubs.


  Use exact flashcard_schema: Front (MCQ/cloze/etc. with 3 distractors), Back (answer, explanation, refs, objective link).
  Distribute across scaffolding layers (12-13 per layer). Vary Bloom''s coverage. Ensure active recall, no hints on front.
  Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''references'': [...],
  ''related_objective'': ''...''}}, ...]. Make distractors educational.'
