active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, analyze how a spike in Event ID 4625 (failed logons) followed by Event ID 4624
    (successful logon) from an unusual IP could indicate a brute-force attack. Propose and debate three mitigation strategies,
    justifying their effectiveness using NIST SP 800-61 principles.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
