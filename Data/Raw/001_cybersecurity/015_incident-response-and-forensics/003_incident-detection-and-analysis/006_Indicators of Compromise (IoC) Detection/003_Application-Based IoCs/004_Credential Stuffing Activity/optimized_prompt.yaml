active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains combo lists, the harvest stage, and ATO with real-world examples (e.g., from
    breaches like LinkedIn); the partner teaches back using a diagram of the attack flow and quizzes the first student.
  problem_solving: 'Analyze this provided Apache/Nginx log snippet [insert sample: e.g., multiple 401 errors from one IP with
    headless browser user-agents like ''HeadlessChrome'']. Detect IoCs (high failure rates, unusual geolocations), hypothesize
    attack stage, and recommend next analysis steps like SIEM query or proxy tracing.'

    attacks).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Incident Response and Forensics
  (Domain: 002_Detection and Analysis; Subdomain: Application-Based IoCs). Topic: Credential Stuffing Activity (Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Incident 002_Detection and Analysis > 004_Indicators of Compromise
  (IoC) Detection > Application-Based IoCs > Credential Stuffing Activity).


  Incorporate this research summary: Credential stuffing is an automated attack using combo lists (stolen username-password
  pairs from breaches) for ATO. Stages: Harvest (acquire lists), Automate (bot logins), Exploit (account control). IoCs: High
  failed logins/single IP, geolocation mismatches, headless user-agents, CAPTCHA rates. Detection: SIEM rules, rate limiting,
  behavioral analytics. Business Impact: Financial fraud, data theft, reputation damage. Sources: iddataweb.com, sentinelone.com,
