active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, select one OWASP API Security Top 10 risk (e.g., Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting), explain its
    associated abuse pattern (e.g., excessive requests), provide a real-world example, and teach it to another pair, followed
    by Q&A.
  problem_solving: Analyze simulated API logs containing IoCs such as 'rapid successive authentication failures from the same
    IP' or 'requests with malformed JSON payloads exploiting injection'. Identify the abuse pattern, map it to an OWASP risk,
    and propose a detection rule.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MC card: 1. Common misconception (e.g., confuse API4 rate limiting with
    API2 auth). 2. Partial truth/superficial similarity (e.g., similar OWASP risk). 3. Plausible but incorrect (e.g., unrelated
    vuln like XSS). Base on voter-noted examples (e.g., malformed payloads) and real-world pitfalls (false positives in logs).
    Ensure distractors promote active recall and error-based learning.'

  > 004_Indicators of Compromise (IoC) Detection (L4) > Application-Based IoCs (L5) > API Abuse Pattern Detection (L6)). Generate
  40-60 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Spaced Repetition, covering university-level pedagogy (Bloom''s Taxonomy,
  active learning, scaffolding).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the full array from ''learning_objectives'']

  - Active Learning: [paste summaries from ''active_learning'']

  - Scaffolding: 4 layers [paste full ''scaffolding'' details, including full OWASP API Top 10 list, concept map, examples
  like rapid auth failures/malformed JSON/excessive requests, RFC 9424, NIST SP 800-228, Google Cloud/Apigee tools].

  - Ensure completeness: Full OWASP API Security Top 10 coverage, voter priorities (100% approval).


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly [paste full ''flashcard_schema'']:

  - Balance: 20% Remember/Understand (Layers 1-2), 30% Apply/Analyze (Layer 3), 30% Evaluate (Layer 4), 20% Create (integration).

  - 70% MC, 30% SA. Include 10 log analysis cards, 10 OWASP-focused, 10 rule/design cards.

  - Distractors per protocol.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''options'': [''A: ...'', ...] or null for SA, ''back'':
  {''correct_answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''related_activity'': ''...''}, ''metadata'': {...}}]. No extra
  text.'
