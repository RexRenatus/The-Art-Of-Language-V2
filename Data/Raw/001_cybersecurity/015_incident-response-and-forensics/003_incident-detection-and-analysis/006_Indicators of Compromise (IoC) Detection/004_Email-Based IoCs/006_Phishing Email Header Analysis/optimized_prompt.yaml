active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, analyze how attackers exploit email header spoofing (e.g., forging From or manipulating
    Received headers) and debate the effectiveness of countermeasures like DMARC alignment. Support your arguments with real-world
    examples from sources like NIST SP 800-61.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs: Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g., for ''SPF=pass''
    as legit: distractors= ''Always legit'', ''Ignores DKIM'', ''IP mismatch overrides''). Ensure distractors are realistic
    (e.g., similar fields like Return-Path vs. From) but incorrect per standards. Vary difficulty: 1 easy (obvious wrong),
    1 medium (partial truth), 1 hard (subtle trap).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Phishing Email Header Analysis
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Incident 002_Detection and Analysis > 004_Indicators
  of Compromise (IoC) Detection > Email-Based IoCs > Phishing Email Header Analysis). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards
  optimized for Anki/Quizlet using university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (prioritize even distribution across REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND/APPLY/ANALYZE/EVALUATE/CREATE),
  active learning (embed hints to discussion/peer teaching/problems), 4-layer scaffolding (tag each card), and spaced repetition
  best practices (active recall, no pure memorization).


  Incorporate research context: Key headers (From, To, Subject, Date, Received chain, Message-ID, Return-Path, Content-Type,
  MIME-Version, X-Originating-IP); indicators (spoofing via mismatches, SPF/DKIM/DMARC fails); tools (MX Toolbox, Google Admin
  Toolbox); links to NIST SP 800-61, SMTP/RFCs. Ground in voter consensus: analogies (digital postmarks), examples (suspicious
  vs. legit), prior knowledge (basic email/IoCs).
