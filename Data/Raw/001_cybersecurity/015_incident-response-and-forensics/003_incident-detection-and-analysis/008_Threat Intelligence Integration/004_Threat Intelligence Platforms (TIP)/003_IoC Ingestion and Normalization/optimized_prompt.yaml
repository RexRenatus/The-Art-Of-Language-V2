active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group, debate the trade-offs between using standardized formats like STIX/TAXII for IoC normalization
    versus custom formats in a small SOC environment. Consider factors like interoperability, implementation cost, and scalability,
    referencing NIST SP 800-61 and Cyber.gov.au SIEM best practices.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs: Create 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse STIX with TAXII
    roles; mix up ingestion vs. enrichment; use similar but incorrect standards like STIX2.0 vs. 2.1). Ensure distractors
    are realistic (e.g., ''Custom JSON'' vs. ''STIX'' for normalization formats) and drawn from research context/NIST errors.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic ''IoC Ingestion and Normalization''
  in hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Incident 002_Detection and Analysis > 005_Threat Intelligence
  Integration > Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIP) > IoC Ingestion and Normalization (Level 6). Assume prior knowledge of
  basic IoCs from Detection basics.


  **Core Content (Complete with Best Practices/Sources):** IoCs: IPs, hashes, URLs indicating compromise. Ingestion: Collect/import
  from feeds/logs into TIPs. Normalization: Standardize to STIX (e.g., IP to IPv4-Addr Observable). Standards: STIX/TAXII
  (OASIS), NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2/3 (incident handling, data analysis), Cyber.gov.au (SIEM priority logs: auth, network, EDR).
  Tools: MISP, Splunk. Best Practices: 1. Collect/parse diverse sources; 2. Normalize/validate STIX; 3. TAXII automate; 4.
  Integrate SIEM/IR (e.g., Splunk feeds); 5. Handle errors (duplicates, formats). Example: Normalize SHA256 hash to STIX bundle.
