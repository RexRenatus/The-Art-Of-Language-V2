        "core_logic": "TTPs are vital because they represent the 'how' of adversary actions, providing deep insights derived during analysis that directly inform defensive measures and threat hunting, thus closing the intelligence loop.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly place TTPs in collection, processing, or solely dissemination, failing to recognize their role as analytical outputs that drive defensive actions.",
        "analogy": "TTPs are like the playbook of a criminal organization; understanding their methods (TTPs) helps law enforcement anticipate and counter their next moves."
