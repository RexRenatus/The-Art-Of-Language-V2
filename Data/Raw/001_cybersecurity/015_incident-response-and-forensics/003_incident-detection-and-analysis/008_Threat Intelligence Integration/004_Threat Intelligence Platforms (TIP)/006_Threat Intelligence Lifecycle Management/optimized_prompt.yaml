  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue which stage of the threat intelligence lifecycle (Planning & Direction, Collection,
    Processing, Analysis & Production, Dissemination, Feedback) is most critical for preventing ransomware attacks. Defend
    your position with real-world examples from NIST SP 800-150, such as structured sharing of IoCs and TTPs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Comprehensive Content (Web-Grounded Research, Completed per Voter Consensus):**

  Threat Intelligence Lifecycle: Structured process (Planning & Direction: set intel requirements; Collection: gather raw
  data from feeds/OSINT; Processing/Exploitation: filter, normalize, enrich (e.g., IoC validation); Analysis & Production:
  contextualize into reports (TTPs, actor attribution); Dissemination: share via STIX/TAXII; Feedback: measure impact, refine).
  Integrates with TIPs like MISP (automated collection/processing/sharing).


  Core Concepts: Cyber Threat Information (NIST SP 800-150); IoCs (evidence like IPs/hashes, RFC 9424: STIX 2.1/TAXII 2.1
  for CTI sharing/exchange, enabling automated TIP interoperability); TTPs (MITRE ATT&CK).

  NIST CSF 2.0/SP 800-61 Rev. 3: Integrate intel into IR risk management.

  RFC 9424 (full): Defines STIX 2.1 objects (e.g., Indicators, Reports) and TAXII 2.1 channels for secure, scalable CTI exchange
  in TIPs.


  **Sources:** NIST SP 800-150 (csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/150), NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 (csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/61/r3), RFC
  9424 (datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9424), MITRE ATT&CK (attack.mitre.org), MISP Project (misp-project.org).


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Use provided Learning Objectives (span Bloom''s: Remember to Create). Scaffolding: Generate flashcards
  progressively across 4 layers (Foundation → Components → Implementation → Integration). Active Learning: Embed scenario-based
  cards from discussion/problem-solving exercises. Prerequisites: Link to IR basics (NIST SP 800-61). Concept Map: Flashcards
  reference ''Lifecycle hub → stage spokes → TIP/feedback links''.


  **Generate Flashcards:** Strictly follow Flashcard Schema. Output ONLY a JSON array of objects, e.g., [{''type'': ''mcq'',
  ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''APPLY'', ''scaffolding_layer'': 3, ''hierarchy_tag'':
  ''Level 6''}]. Ensure high-quality: measurable, active recall, distractors plausible, explanations tie to standards/TIPs/real-world
  (e.g., ransomware via NIST). Balance coverage: All objectives/layers. Voter-approved: 82.9% consensus.'
