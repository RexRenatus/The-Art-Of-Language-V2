  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the learning_objectives array above]

  - Active Learning: Use for scenario-based cards.

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste the scaffolding_layers array above]. Distribute cards across layers.

  - Big Picture: Incident Response Detection phase, SOC prioritization, false positive reduction.

  - Sources: NIST SP 800-61r2 (nist.gov), CISA AIS (cisa.gov/ais), RFC 9424 (datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9424), STIX
  2.1 (oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation).


  Follow this schema strictly [paste flashcard_generation_schema above]. Output as JSON array of flashcards, each with: {''type'':
