active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast breach notification timelines and requirements under HIPAA (60 days to individuals,
    report to HHS) versus GDPR (72 hours to authorities, 3 months to individuals). Debate the challenges for a multinational
    organization experiencing a breach affecting both US and EU customers. What strategies (e.g., automation, unified IR plans)
    could mitigate compliance risks?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these learning objectives [insert learning_objectives array]. Use this 4-layer scaffolding [insert scaffolding
  object]. Include active learning elements for context [insert active_learning object].


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following this exact schema [insert flashcard_schema details]. Ensure progression: 4-5
  per Bloom''s level, balanced across layers/regulations (HIPAA: 60 days individuals/60-day HHS; GDPR: 72h authorities/3mo
  individuals; CCPA: 45-60 days consumers; GLBA financial; state e.g. NY SHIELD; NIST SP 800-61/CSF 2.0). Cover risk factors,
  timelines, recipients, content, integration.


  Key content: Data breach definition, 4 risk factors, notification purposes, procedures, multinational challenges. Distractors
