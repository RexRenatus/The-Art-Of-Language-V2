active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs in incident status reporting frequency during a live phishing campaign affecting
    multiple departments. Should reports be daily, real-time, or event-triggered? Debate using NIST SP 800-61 guidelines,
    considering stakeholder needs (e.g., executives vs. technical teams), operational burden, and impact on MTTR.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains core elements of an incident status report (e.g., incident summary, impact
    assessment, actions taken, next steps) using a NIST SP 800-61-inspired template; the partner teaches back by creating
    a sample report for a mock SQL injection incident and receives feedback on clarity and completeness.
  problem_solving: In small groups, analyze a real-world scenario (e.g., DDoS attack escalating to data exfiltration). Iteratively
    draft status reports at different IR phases (detection, analysis, containment), apply communication plans, address stakeholder
    queries, and refine based on group critique to simulate reducing MTTR.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ: 3 distractors per question.

    - Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., ''Reporting only after resolution'' vs. ongoing).

    - Distractor 2: Related but incorrect concept (e.g., confuse stakeholders with ''only executives'' vs. full list).

    - Distractor 3: Partial truth/opposite (e.g., ''Real-time for all'' vs. tailored frequency).

    Ensure plausible, derived from scaffolding/research (e.g., wrong NIST phases, incomplete report elements).'
