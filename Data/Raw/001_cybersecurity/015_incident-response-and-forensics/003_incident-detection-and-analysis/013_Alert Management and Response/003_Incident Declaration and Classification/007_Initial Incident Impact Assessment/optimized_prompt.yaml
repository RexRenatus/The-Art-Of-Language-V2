active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how initial impact assessment could have altered the response timeline
    and outcomes in real-world incidents like the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack or SolarWinds supply chain breach. Support
    arguments with NIST SP 800-61r3 principles.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors that are: 1) Superficially similar (e.g., swap CIA elements); 2) Based on real
    pitfalls (e.g., underestimating business impact); 3) Drawn from related concepts (e.g., mix with forensics); 4) Aligned
    to voter errors like incomplete best practices. Ensure 70% MCQs for spaced repetition.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Incident Response. Generate\
  \ 25 high-quality flashcards (18 MCQs, 7 Short Answer) on 'Initial Incident Impact Assessment' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity\
  \ > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Incident 002_Detection and Analysis > 013_Alert Management and Response > Incident\
  \ Declaration and Classification > Initial Incident Impact Assessment). Cover all 6 learning objectives (REMEMBER to CREATE),\
  \ distribute evenly across 4 scaffolding layers, incorporate active learning scenarios/examples, NIST SP 800-61r3 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r3.pdf),\
  \ CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), real-world cases (ransomware like Colonial Pipeline), best practices (CIA\
