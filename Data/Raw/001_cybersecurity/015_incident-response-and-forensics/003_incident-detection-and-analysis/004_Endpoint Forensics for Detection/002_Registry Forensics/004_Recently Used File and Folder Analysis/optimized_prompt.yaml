active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how recently used file analysis from registry artifacts contributes to
    IOC detection in the NIST SP 800-61 Detection & Analysis phase. Consider challenges in OT environments (e.g., NISTIR 8428
    hybrid frameworks) like volatile data loss or industrial control system constraints—what mitigations would you propose?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Research Context: Complete summary includes NIST SP 800-61r3 (IR lifecycle: Detection & Analysis via artifacts like MRU
  for IOCs), NIST SP 800-86 (forensics), NIST SP 800-82 (ICS/OT), NISTIR 8428 (OT framework for hybrid environments, emphasizing
  endpoint artifacts in SCADA/ICS), best practices (acquire volatiles first, timeline correlation). Keys: RecentDocs, RunMRU,
  etc. Tools: RegRipper, Registry Explorer, Volatility. Big picture: Fits NIST IR Detection phase for endpoint IOCs leading
  to containment.
