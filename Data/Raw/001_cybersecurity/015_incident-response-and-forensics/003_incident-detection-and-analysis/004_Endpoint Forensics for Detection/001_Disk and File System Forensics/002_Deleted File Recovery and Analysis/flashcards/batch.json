        "core_logic": "SSDs employ TRIM commands, which inform the drive that blocks are no longer in use, allowing the drive's controller to internally garbage collect and erase them for performance. Wear-leveling also distributes writes, potentially moving data. These processes actively reduce data remanence, making deleted file recovery significantly harder than on HDDs where data persists until physically overwritten.",
