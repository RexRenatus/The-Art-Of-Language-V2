active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a supply chain attack, how does lateral movement from a compromised vendor (e.g., via RDP from vendor
    IPs) differ from internal threats? Discuss detection challenges and propose one SIEM rule to mitigate it, citing MITRE
    ATT&CK TA0008 techniques.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Vendor Lateral Movement
  Detection'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Incident 002_Detection and Analysis > 010_Specialized
  Detection Scenarios > Supply Chain Attack Detection > Vendor Lateral Movement Detection). Focus: Detecting lateral movement
  (MITRE TA0008) from compromised vendors in supply chain attacks (e.g., anomalous VPN/RDP from vendor IPs), not vendor tools
  primarily.


  Incorporate university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives [insert learning_objectives array]; active learning hooks
  [insert active_learning]; 4-layer scaffolding [insert scaffolding]. Prerequisites: MITRE TTPs, network protocols.


  Best practices (complete from research): Monitor vendor baselines, SIEM rules for recon/privilege escalation, NCSC supply
  chain guidelines, ML anomalies. Sources: MITRE ATT&CK, cyberdefenders.org, NCSC.gov.uk.
