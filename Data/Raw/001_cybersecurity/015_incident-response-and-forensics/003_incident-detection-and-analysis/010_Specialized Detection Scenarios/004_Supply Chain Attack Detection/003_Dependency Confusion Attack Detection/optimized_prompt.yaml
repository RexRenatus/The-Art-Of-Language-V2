active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a team debate, argue whether organizations should fully migrate to private repositories or implement
    advanced detection tools like package allowlisting and monitoring with Socket. Use real-world examples like the 2020-2021
    npm dependency confusion incidents (e.g., 'ua-parser-js', 'path-parse') to support your position. What trade-offs exist
    between security, developer productivity, and cost? Discuss misconceptions such as over-relying on public repositories
    without scoping.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs: Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse with typosquatting
    by using similar-sounding package names; mix public/private registry roles; include ineffective mitigations like ''ignore
    warnings''). Ensure distractors are realistic from voter consensus and research (e.g., over-reliance on audits without
    scoping).'
