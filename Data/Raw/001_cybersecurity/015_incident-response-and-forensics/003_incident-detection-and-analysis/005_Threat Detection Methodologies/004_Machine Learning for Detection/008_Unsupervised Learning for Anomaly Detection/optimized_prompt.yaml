active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages and disadvantages of unsupervised learning for anomaly detection
    versus supervised methods in cybersecurity. Consider scenarios like zero-day attacks or unlabeled log data from incident
    response—how does the lack of labels impact reliability, and when would you hybridize approaches?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Common errors: Overstate assumptions (e.g., ''Requires clean data'' vs. robust to noise).'
    - 'Contextual misleads: Cybersecurity-specific, e.g., ''Best for known signatures'' (vs. zero-days).'
    - 'Balanced difficulty: 1 easy (superficial), 1 medium (partial truth), 1 hard (subtle distinction).'

  **Core Content (Complete from Research + Voter Completions):** Definitions: Anomaly detection (deviations from normal);
  Unsupervised (no labels, finds structures). Techniques: Clustering (K-Means/DBSCAN outliers), Autoencoders (high reconstruction
  error), Isolation Forest (isolate anomalies via random splits), one-class SVM. Applications: UEBA (profile user/entity behavior
  for insider threats/lateral movement), malware detection (host anomalies), HIDS (intrusion via logs), log analysis (unusual
  events). Big picture: Detects zero-days in incident response; contrasts supervised (no labels needed).


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives above].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers above].


  **Active Learning Ties:** Reference discussions (pros/cons), peer-teaching (Isolation Forest), problem-solving (KDD Cup
  dataset) where relevant.
