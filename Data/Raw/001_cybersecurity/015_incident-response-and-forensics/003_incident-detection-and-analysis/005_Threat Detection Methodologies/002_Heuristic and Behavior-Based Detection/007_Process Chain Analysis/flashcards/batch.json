        "core_logic": "A scheduled task is a classic persistence technique because it ensures the attacker's code or access method automatically restarts even after a system reboot. This functions by hooking into the operating system's startup processes, allowing the attacker to maintain a foothold without needing to re-exploit the initial vulnerability.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Phishing is initial access. File encryption is a payload (e.g., ransomware). Network scanning is reconnaissance/movement. A scheduled task is a common method for maintaining access.",
