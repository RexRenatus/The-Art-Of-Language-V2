active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether UEBA should prioritize user privacy or threat detection in high-risk
    environments like finance. Use real-world examples like the SolarWinds breach to support your position, referencing baseline
    deviations and false positives.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
