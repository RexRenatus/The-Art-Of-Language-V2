active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of rule-based vs. ML-based event correlation in a high-volume
    SOC environment. Use real-world examples from Splunk or ELK SIEMs to support arguments on false positive reduction and
    threat detection speed.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    of ''value_count''); 2) Misconception (e.g., ''alerts all logs'' vs. ''correlates patterns''); 3) Irrelevant (e.g., unrelated
    SIEM feature). Ensure multiple-choice format where applicable.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on
  ''Event Correlation Rule Engines'' using the exact topic_hierarchy: [''Cybersecurity'', ''002_Incident Response And Forensics'',
  ''Incident 002_Detection and Analysis'', ''001_Detection Infrastructure and Architecture'', ''Security Monitoring Systems'',
  ''Event Correlation Rule Engines'']. Prerequisite: Learners know Security Monitoring Systems (logs/SIEM basics); build from
  individual events to correlations.


  Incorporate: Web research (IT events as log footprints, correlation reduces noise in SIEMs like Splunk/ELK, NIST CSF/SP
  800-61 integration); Voter consensus (Sigma spec complete: conditions/value_count>threshold, sequence, etc.; layers; brute-force
  examples; measurable Bloom''s objectives).


  Structure content across 4 scaffolding layers (use in flashcards): Layer 1 Foundation (terms), Layer 2 Components (rule
  anatomy/relationships), Layer 3 Implementation (write/test Sigma/Splunk rules), Layer 4 Integration (gaps/NIST).


  Use provided learning_objectives, active_learning for inspiration (e.g., log samples for APPLY). Output ONLY a JSON array
  of 50 flashcards, each matching flashcard_schema exactly (snake_case, 3 distractors, blooms_level, layer, topic_hierarchy
  verbatim). Ensure active recall: questions test application/analysis with logs/examples. No extra text.'
