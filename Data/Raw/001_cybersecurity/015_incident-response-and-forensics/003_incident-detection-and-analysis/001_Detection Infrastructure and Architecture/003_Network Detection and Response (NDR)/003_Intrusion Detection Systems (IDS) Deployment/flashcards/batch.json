        "core_logic": "Cloud environments utilize shared infrastructure and heavy virtualization, which can obscure network traffic flows. This lack of direct network access makes it challenging to deploy traditional NIDS sensors and gain the same level of visibility as in an on-premises network because traffic may not traverse easily accessible points.",

        "analogy": "Deploying IDS in the cloud is like trying to monitor traffic flow in a city where roads are constantly being rerouted underground; it's harder to see exactly where everything is going."

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Correlation in IDS analysis involves linking related events from various sources (e.g., different sensors, logs) to build a more complete picture of an attack. This is important because a single alert might be insignificant, but when combined with others, it can reveal a pattern indicative of a serious, coordinated threat.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors misinterpret correlation as ignoring alerts, implementing a simplistic blocking rule, or performing basic categorization instead of event linking.",
        "analogy": "Alert correlation is like piecing together clues in a detective story; one clue might not mean much, but several clues together reveal the culprit's plan."
