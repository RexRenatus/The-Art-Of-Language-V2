    tools like standalone EDR, or is a hybrid model essential for complex environments?'' Support arguments with examples
    from Microsoft Sentinel, Splunk, or Cortex XSOAR, and reference NIST SP 800-61 analysis phase requirements.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

    others); 2) Common misconception (e.g., ''Unified interfaces replace SIEM entirely''); 3) Related but incorrect term (e.g.,
    confuse SOAR with SIEM). Base on voter-noted gaps like truncated NIST or tool specifics.'

  **Core Content (Synthesized from Web Research, NIST SP 800-61r2, Voter Consensus):** Use the exact scaffolding layers provided
  below. Complete NIST details: SP 800-61r2 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf) emphasizes
  Analysis phase (collect, process, correlate data); key takeaway: Unified views reduce ''tool sprawl''. Sources: Microsoft
  Sentinel Docs (https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/), Splunk IR (https://www.splunk.com/en_us/solutions/solution-areas/security.html),
  Cortex XSOAR (https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/xsoar), NIST CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework).


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s Taxonomy):** [Insert the 6 objectives from above JSON].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the full 4 layers from above JSON].


  **Active Learning Context:** Flashcards should support these activities [briefly reference discussion/peer/problem-solving
  for application ideas].


  **Generation Instructions:**

  - Produce 25 flashcards covering all Bloom''s levels (per objectives) and scaffolding layers.

  - Strictly follow flashcard_schema: 12 basic_QA, 13 MCQ.

  - Ensure university pedagogy: Active recall, spaced repetition friendly, explanations scaffold from foundation to integration.

  - Distractors per protocol.

  - Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''basic_qa|mcq'', ''front'': {...}, ''back'': {...}, ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'':
  ''...'', ''objective'': ''#''}]

  - Voter priorities: Measurable objectives, complete NIST/tools, prior knowledge links, 4-layer structure.
