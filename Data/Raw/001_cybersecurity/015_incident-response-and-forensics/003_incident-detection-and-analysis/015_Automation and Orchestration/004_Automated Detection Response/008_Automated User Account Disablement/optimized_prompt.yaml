  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list from above].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full prior_knowledge and layers from above].


  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Reference discussion, peer teaching, etc., in explanations to encourage application.


  **Content Sources:** NIST SP 800-61 (Incident Handling Guide), NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Respond function), SP 800-63
  (Identity), AWS Prescriptive Guidance (Step Functions for IAM suspension), tools: SIEM (Splunk), SOAR (Phantom, Azure Sentinel),
  APIs (Okta, Active Directory). Prioritize automation in Detection/Analysis and Containment.


  **Output Format:** JSON array of flashcards. Each: {''id'': 1, ''bloom_level'': ''REMEMBER'', ''type'': ''Q&A'' or ''MCQ'',
  ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [...] if MCQ, ''source'':
  ''...'', ''hierarchy'': ''exact string''}}.


  **Schema Compliance:** Follow flashcard_generation_schema exactly. Balance levels. Distractors: plausible, misconception-based.
  Explanations: 100-200 words, pedagogical, with hooks to objectives/activities. Ensure completeness, no errors.'
