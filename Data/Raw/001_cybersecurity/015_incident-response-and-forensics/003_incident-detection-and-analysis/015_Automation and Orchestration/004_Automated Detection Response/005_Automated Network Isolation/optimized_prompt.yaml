active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the risks of false positives in automated network isolation (e.g., legitimate
    traffic blocked) versus the benefits of rapid containment during a ransomware attack. Reference NIST SP 800-61 and real-world
    examples like SolarWinds.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Completed Research Context: Automated network isolation auto-segments compromised assets via SOAR/EDR triggers to contain
  threats, reducing MTTR. NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/61/r3/final) integrates IR into CSF 2.0,
  emphasizing containment (DE.RS-05). NIST SP 800-207 Zero Trust (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/207/final) uses micro-segmentation
  for policy-enforced isolation. Tools: Palo Alto Cortex XSOAR, Cisco ISE, Ansible. Prior knowledge: Networking (VLANs, firewalls),
  IR phases. Big Picture: Fits NIST CSF Detect/Respond, accelerates to eradication/recovery.
