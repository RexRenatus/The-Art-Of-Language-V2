active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In groups, debate the trade-offs of prioritizing low false positives versus high detection rates in detection
    rules. Use real-world examples like the SolarWinds breach where rule tuning could have helped. Categorize rules by performance
    metrics (precision, recall) and reference NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 on balancing detection efficacy with operational efficiency.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    detection''), 2) Partial truths (e.g., swap precision/recall), 3) Edge cases (e.g., ignore latency in high-FP scenario),
    4) Voter-suggested trade-offs (e.g., overemphasize FPs vs. FNRs). Ensure distractors are realistic from cybersecurity
    contexts like SolarWinds.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Detection Rule Performance

  **Completed Research Context:** Detection rules are patterns triggering alerts on logs/traffic. Optimization improves speed,
  accuracy, resources (reduce FPs, latency). NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 (''Incident Response Recommendations... CSF 2.0'') integrates
  detection into risk management, stressing tunable rules for Detect function. NISTIR 8428 completes: ''framework''s Detect
  function emphasizes tunable rules to minimize noise and alert fatigue in hybrid environments.'' Techniques: rule tuning
  (thresholds), FP reduction (whitelisting, correlation), query optimization (aggregation, indexing). Metrics: precision/recall,
  FPR/FNR, latency/CPU.


  **Prior Knowledge:** Assumes basics from Detection Rule Development (syntax), NIST 800-61 (IR phases: preparation, detection/analysis),
  logging (SIEM sources).
