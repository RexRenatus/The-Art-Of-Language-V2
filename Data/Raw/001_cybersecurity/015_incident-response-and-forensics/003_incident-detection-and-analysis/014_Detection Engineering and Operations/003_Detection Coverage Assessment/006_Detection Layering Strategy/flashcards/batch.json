By understanding current TTPs and IOCs, organizations can proactively tune their detection rules (e.g., in SIEMs, IDS/IPS, EDR) to specifically look for these indicators. This makes the detection layers more effective because they are aligned with real-world threats, rather than relying solely on generic signatures or behavioral anomalies. This functions by informing the creation and refinement of detection logic.",
