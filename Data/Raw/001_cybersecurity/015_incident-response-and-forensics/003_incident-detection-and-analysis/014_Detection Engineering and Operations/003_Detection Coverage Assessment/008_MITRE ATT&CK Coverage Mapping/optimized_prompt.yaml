active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In groups, debate which MITRE ATT&CK tactics (e.g., Initial Access vs. Exfiltration) are most critical
    for your industry sector and identify common coverage gaps in commercial detection tools. Use evidence from ATT&CK Navigator
    layers and real-world breach reports to support arguments, fostering critical thinking on prioritization and relevance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse tactics with techniques);
    2) Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., valid tool but wrong matrix); 3) Edge case/extreme (e.g., unrelated tactic).
    Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter-noted issues (e.g., tactics vs. techniques) and research (e.g., incomplete
    mappings from CISA best practices). Balance difficulty.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-style pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 40 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''MITRE ATT&CK Coverage
  Mapping'' (Category: Cybersecurity; Domain: 002_Incident Response And Forensics; Subdomain: Incident 002_Detection and Analysis;
  Entry Domain: 012_Detection Engineering and Operations; Entry Subdomain: Detection Coverage Assessment). Topic Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Incident 002_Detection and Analysis > 012_Detection Engineering and
  Operations > Detection Coverage Assessment > MITRE ATT&CK Coverage Mapping.


  Incorporate these ELEMENTS:

  - LEARNING OBJECTIVES: [Insert full list from JSON above]. Balance flashcards: 20% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze,
  50% Evaluate/Create.

  - ACTIVE LEARNING: Tie explanations to discussion (industry debates), peer teaching (technique teach-backs), problem-solving
  (EDR mapping scenarios). [Insert full active learning from JSON].

  - SCAFFOLDING: Distribute evenly across 4 layers. [Insert full scaffolding layers from JSON]. Prior knowledge: NIST IR lifecycle,
  threat hunting.

  - RESEARCH CONTEXT: Ground in MITRE ATT&CK (Enterprise matrix, tactics/techniques/TTPs), tools (Navigator, Coverage app,
  Atomic Red Team), CISA best practices, sources (mitre.org, cisa.gov, arxiv.org/2502.10825v1). Concept map: Central ''Coverage
  Mapping'' → Tactics/Techniques → Gaps/Tools → Metrics/Integration.

  - Voter Consensus: Emphasize gaps, Navigator, steps, examples (T1059), full 4-layer structure.


  FOLLOW FLASHCARD SCHEMA STRICTLY: [Insert full schema from JSON]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 40 flashcards, each as {"front":
  "...", "back": {"correct_answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "bloom_level": "...", "scaffolding_layer": "...", "reference":
  "...", "related_activity": "..."}}. Ensure variety, no repetition, high educational value, and distractors per protocol.
  Make engaging and precise for detection engineers.'
