        "core_logic": "Without regular analysis, detection mechanisms can become outdated or misconfigured, allowing sophisticated threats like APTs to evade notice and cause significant damage over time.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Failing to analyze gaps typically leads to *more* undetected threats and potentially *more* complex incidents, not fewer alerts or simpler procedures. Over-reliance on signatures is a *cause* of gaps, not a consequence of *failing* to analyze them.",
        "analogy": "It's like not checking your car's brakes regularly; the consequence isn't that the brakes work better, but that they might fail when you need them most, leading to an accident."
