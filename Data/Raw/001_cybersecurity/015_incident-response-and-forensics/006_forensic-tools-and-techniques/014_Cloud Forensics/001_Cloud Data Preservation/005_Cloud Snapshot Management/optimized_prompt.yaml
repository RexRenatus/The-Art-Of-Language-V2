  scaffolding.


  **Content Sources (Complete Voter Priorities):** Integrate provided research: Snapshots as point-in-time copies for IR/forensics;
  NIST SP 800-201 CC FRA (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-201.pdf); Shared Responsibility
  Model (cloud provider secures infra, customer secures data/snapshots). Best Practices (completed): Secure backups via encryption
  (KMS), IAM least privilege, tagging (forensic-ready), isolation (snapshot to forensic account), versioning, chain of custody
  logging, regular IR drills. AWS: aws ec2 create-snapshot --volume-id vol-123 --description ''IR Forensic''. Real-world:
  Ransomware - snapshot before encryption wipe. Sources: AWS IR Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-incident-response/snapshots.html),
  Azure Docs (https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/snapshot-copy-manage), NIST (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/201/final).


  **Prior Knowledge:** VMs, backups, IR phases, chain of custody.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives from above JSON].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers from above JSON].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Draw from discussion (multi-cloud challenges), peer-teaching (AWS/Azure steps), problem-solving
  (ransomware scenario).


  **Generate 25 flashcards in exact JSON array format:** [{''type'': ''Q&A|MCQ'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'':
  ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''...'', ''source'': ''...''}}, ...]. Follow flashcard_schema
  precisely: Varied types, distractor protocol for MCQs, comprehensive coverage. Ensure active, measurable, forensic-focused.
