active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given a container security breach in a Google Cloud Kubernetes cluster where unauthorized crypto-mining
    processes were detected, debate the most likely attack vectors (e.g., supply chain compromise via tainted image, kernel
    escape, misconfigured RBAC) and prioritize initial forensic investigation steps using tools like Falco or gVisor. Consider
    links to prior knowledge from basic containerization (Docker) and incident response phases (identification, containment).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Containers provide full
    VM isolation' vs. correct 'process/kernel sharing'); near-misses (e.g., similar tools like 'Docker' vs. 'containerd');
    or partial truths (e.g., 'SBOM only for code' vs. 'includes dependencies/supply chain'). Ensure distractors test analysis
    (e.g., confuse Falco with Trivy).
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Container Security Investigation\
  \ (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Forensic Tools and Techniques > 014_Cloud Forensics\
