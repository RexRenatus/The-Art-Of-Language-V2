        "core_logic": "The shared responsibility model is fundamental because it defines the boundaries of control and security duties. Understanding this helps investigators know what data and logs are accessible via Google's infrastructure and what actions they, as the customer, must perform.",

        "analogy": "The shared responsibility model is like a lease agreement for a building; it clearly states who is responsible for maintaining the structure (provider) and who is responsible for securing the contents within their unit (customer)."

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Live analysis poses a significant risk because running commands, accessing files, and examining memory can inadvertently modify timestamps, overwrite data, or terminate malicious processes. Therefore, creating an immutable snapshot first is paramount to preserving evidence integrity.",
        "distractor_analysis": "While performance and detection are concerns, the most critical risk is that the act of analysis itself directly corrupts the evidence being sought, undermining the entire investigation.",
