  peer_teaching: 'In pairs: One student explains Persistent Disk detachment/reattachment for forensics (including gcloud commands);
    the partner teaches back using a real-world breach example (e.g., Capital One AWS breach adapted to GCP), then switch
    roles.'
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: Analyze a simulated compromised GCP Persistent Disk snapshot for malware artifacts indicating
    an integrity violation. Provide a step-by-step guide: (1) Create snapshot via GCP Console/gcloud, (2) Attach to forensic
    VM read-only, (3) Mount with ntfs-3g/ext4fuse, (4) Use Autopsy/Sleuth Kit for timeline analysis and carving, (5) Verify
    hashes. Discuss findings in relation to CIA Triad.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in GCP Cloud Forensics. Generate
  50 high-quality flashcards on ''GCP Persistent Disk Volume Analysis'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response
  And Forensics > Forensic Tools and Techniques > 014_Cloud Forensics > Google 014_Cloud Forensics > GCP Persistent Disk Volume
  Analysis).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives: [insert learning_objectives array here]

  - Active learning for reinforcement: [insert active_learning object here]

  - Scaffolding layers: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers [insert scaffolding object here] (aim for 12-13 per layer).

  - Ensure coverage of key content: Persistent Disk (network block storage, redundant), CIA Triad, snapshots (crash-consistent:
  point-in-time; application-consistent: quiesced via guest agent), disk types (pd-standard/ssd/extreme), forensic process
  (gcloud snapshots, detach/reattach, mount read-only, Autopsy/Sleuth Kit/Volatility, hashing), integration (Logging, Terraform).


  Follow this exact schema for each flashcard [insert flashcard_schema here]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 50 flashcards, e.g.,
  [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}, ''type'': ''...'', ''tags'': [...]}, ...]. Vary difficulty: 40% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND,
  30% APPLY/ANALYZE, 30% EVALUATE/CREATE. Use voter consensus for realism and completeness.'
