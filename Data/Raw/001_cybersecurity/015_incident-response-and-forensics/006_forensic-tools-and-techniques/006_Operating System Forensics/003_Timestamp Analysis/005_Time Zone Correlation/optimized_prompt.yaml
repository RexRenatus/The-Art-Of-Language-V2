  discussion_prompt: 'Discuss in groups: ''Describe a real-world cybersecurity incident (e.g., inspired by SolarWinds or Log4j
    exploits) where time zone mismatches or clock drift led to delayed detection or flawed forensics. What best practices
    could have mitigated this, and how does NIST SP 800-61 emphasize time accuracy?'' Encourage critical thinking on chain-of-custody
    implications.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Topic Hierarchy:** Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Forensic Tools and Techniques > 006_Operating
  System Forensics > Timestamp Analysis > Time Zone Correlation.


  **Incorporate these exactly:**

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the 6 objectives above]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste the 4 layers with content]

  - Active Learning: [reference activities for ties]

  - Best Practices: Fully integrated from NIST SP 800-61, CISA (UTC storage, NTP monitoring, DST handling).


  **Generate 25 high-quality flashcards** optimized for Anki/Quizlet:

  - Cover all Bloom''s levels (4+ per level) and layers (6+ per layer).

  - Use schema: JSON array of objects with ''front'' and ''back'' (as defined).

  - 40% MCQs (4 options, 1 correct; follow distractor protocol).

  - Ensure university pedagogy: Scaffolded progression, active recall, spaced repetition.

  - Ground in research: NIST/CISA/DoD, tools (Timesketch, Plaso, zdump, pytz).

  - Voter priorities: Emphasize completeness (full best practices, examples/errors), time zone specifics (conversions, correlation).


  Output ONLY a JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}}, ...]. No extra text.'
