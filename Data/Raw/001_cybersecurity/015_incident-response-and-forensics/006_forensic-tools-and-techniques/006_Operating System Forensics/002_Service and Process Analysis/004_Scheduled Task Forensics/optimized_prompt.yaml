active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the risks of scheduled tasks running under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM principal.
    How do they contribute to privilege escalation in real-world incidents? Reference MITRE ATT&CK T1053 examples and propose
    mitigation strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: Always exactly 3 distractors per card. Base on voter-noted misconceptions (e.g., triggers vs. actions,
    principles vs. principals, benign vs. malicious paths). Make plausible (e.g., similar commands, common typos). Provide
    brief explanations why each is incorrect, referencing standards like MITRE or MS docs. Ensure distractors test nuance
    without being obvious.
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Scheduled Task Forensics.\
  \ Generate exactly 30 high-quality Anki-style flashcards covering the topic comprehensively. Distribute across Bloom's levels\
  \ (5 REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 10 APPLY/ANALYZE, 10 EVALUATE, 5 CREATE) and scaffolding layers (7-8 per layer). Incorporate active\
  \ learning by including 3 cards as scenario-based problems, 3 as discussion starters, and 3 as peer-teach explanations.\n\
  \nContext:\n- Topic Hierarchy (include EXACTLY this in EVERY flashcard): Level 1: Cybersecurity | Level 2: 002_Incident\
  \ Response And Forensics | Level 3: Forensic Tools and Techniques | Level 4: 006_Operating System Forensics | Level 5: Service\
  \ and Process Analysis | Level 6: Scheduled Task Forensics\n- Prior Knowledge: Builds on Windows services/processes.\n-\
  \ Big Picture: Persistence detection in DFIR for timelines/threat hunting.\n- Key Content: Use the provided scaffolding\
  \ layers, objectives, tools (schtasks.exe /query /fo LIST /v /xml, Get-ScheduledTask, registry HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\\
  Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Schedule\\TaskCache, XML parsing, TaskScheduler logs Event 200/201/322), MITRE T1053, NIST SP\
  \ 800-86.\n- Principals (not principles): Security context (e.g., NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM).\n\nFlashcard Format (JSON array\
