active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the strategic importance of Recycle Bin forensics in DFIR for establishing
    incident timelines, attributing user actions, detecting data exfiltration, and identifying cover-up attempts (e.g., selective
    emptying). Cite real-world examples like insider threats and support with evidence from NTFS recovery techniques.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., ''$I contains file content''). 3) Version differences (e.g., XP vs. Win10). 4) Confusions with related concepts
    ($MFT vs. $I). Ensure 1 correct, 3 distractors; avoid obvious wrongs.'
