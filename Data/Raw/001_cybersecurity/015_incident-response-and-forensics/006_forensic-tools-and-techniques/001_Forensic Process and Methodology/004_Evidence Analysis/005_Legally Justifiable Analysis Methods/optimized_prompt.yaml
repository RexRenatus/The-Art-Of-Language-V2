    2) Partial truth (e.g., ''NIST SP 800-61 covers forensics only''); 3) Unrelated standard (e.g., ''ISO 27001 for hashing'').
    Ensure distractors are web-grounded from NIST contexts but incorrect for legal justifiability.'

  **Full Research Context (Completed and Web-Grounded):**

  Legally Justifiable Analysis Methods ensure forensic processes are defensible in court (e.g., Daubert/Frye standards). Core
  Concepts: Incident Response (IR: NIST SP 800-61 phases); Digital Forensics (acquire/preserve/analyze/present evidence);
  Legally Justifiable (repeatable, documented, validated). Key Methods: Write-blockers (Tableau), Imaging (FTK Imager/dd),
  Hashing (SHA-256), Chain of Custody (logs/forms), Reporting (signed/timestamped).

  Standards:

  - NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/61/r3/final (IR in CSF 2.0: preparation, detection, response,
  recovery).

  - NIST SP 800-86: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-86.pdf (Integrate forensics into IR:
  collection, exam, analysis, reporting; emphasizes integrity via hashing/CoC).

  - NISTIR 8428: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2023/NIST.IR.8428.pdf (CSF profiles for IR).

  - NIST CSF 2.0: https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework (Govern/Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover).
