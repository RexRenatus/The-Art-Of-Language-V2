active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between comprehensive data source recording (e.g., full packet captures, memory
    dumps) and resource constraints in a real incident response scenario. Reference NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/61/r2/final)
    and discuss impacts on chain of custody and legal defensibility. Consider prerequisites from Evidence Collection (003_Collection).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [paste array above]

  - Active learning: Tie explanations to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [paste scaffolding above]; tag each with layer.

  - Prior knowledge: Link to evidence collection basics.


  Follow EXACT flashcard schema [paste schema above]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 30 flashcards, e.g., [{''id'':1, ''type'':''MCQ'',
  ...}]. Ensure variety, distractors per protocol, comprehensive coverage (tools: Wireshark/Volatility; concepts: hashing/timestamps/DFIR).
