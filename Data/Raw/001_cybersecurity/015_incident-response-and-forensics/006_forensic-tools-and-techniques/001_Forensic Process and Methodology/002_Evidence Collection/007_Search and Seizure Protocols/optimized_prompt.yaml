  peer_teaching: In pairs, explain the chain of custody steps to each other using a hand-drawn flowchart; include teach-back
    where the listener quizzes the explainer on key tools and documentation.
  problem_solving: 'Simulate seizing evidence from a virtual machine in a data breach scenario: Document the protocol followed,
    identify pitfalls (e.g., improper imaging), and propose mitigations.'

  **Completed Research Context (NIST-focused, web-grounded):**

  Core Concepts: Digital evidence, search/seizure, incident response, digital forensics, chain of custody, forensically sound
  (bit-for-bit images).

  NIST SP 800-86 (Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques into Incident Response): Covers acquisition (forensic duplicates),
  examination, analysis, reporting. Emphasizes first responder actions: secure scene, document, isolate, collect volatiles.
  Phases align with NIST SP 800-61 IR lifecycle.

  Tools: Write-blockers (Tableau), imaging (FTK Imager, EnCase), hashing (SHA-256 preferred).

  Standards: ISO/IEC 27037 (digital evidence guidelines), ACPO Good Practice Guide.

  Sources: NIST SP 800-86 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-86.pdf), NIST SP 800-61r2

  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s Taxonomy):** [Insert the 6 objectives from above].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Tie flashcards to discussion (speed vs. thoroughness), peer teaching (chain of custody
  flowcharts), problem-solving (VM seizure sims).


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers from above].


  Generate 30 flashcards following the exact schema: Output as JSON array of objects matching {''type'':..., ''bloom_level'':...,
  ''scaffolding_layer'':..., ''question'':..., ''answer'':..., ''options'':[] (if MCQ), ''explanation'':..., ''reference'':...}.
  Ensure pedagogical depth: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, distractors per protocol. Cover all objectives/layers
  uniformly. No duplicates.'
