active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue the forensic trade-offs of acquiring data from a device in BFU (e.g., limited
    data access but higher chain-of-trust integrity) versus AFU (e.g., fuller data but risks from user-unlock volatility).
    Support with real-world scenarios like a seized corporate device post-inactivity reboot.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    term (e.g., mix SEP with main CPU); 3) Partial truth (e.g., ''AFU risks only from passcode brute-force''). Ensure plausible
    for cybersecurity learners; avoid randomness.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in iOS Boot Process Forensics
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Forensic Tools and Techniques > 009_Mobile Device
  Forensics > iOS Forensics > iOS Boot Process Forensics).


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet, covering the full topic including BootROM/SecureROM, LLB,
  iBoot, Kernelcache, Kernel loading, Ramdisk, Kernel Extensions, BFU/AFU states, SEP/keybags, chain-of-trust, exploits (checkm8/checkra1n),
  tools (ideviceinfo, sysdiagnose, Elcomsoft), and forensic strategies.


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list from above]

  - Active Learning: [Insert full descriptions from above]

  - Scaffolding: Progress flashcards from Layer 1 (Foundation) to Layer 4 (Integration), labeling each with layer.


  Follow this exact Flashcard Schema:

  [Insert full schema from above]


  Ensure variety: 40% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND (basic recall/definitions), 30% APPLY/ANALYZE (scenarios/tools), 20% EVALUATE (risks/trade-offs),
  10% CREATE (design procedures). Balance MCQ/short answer/cloze.


  Base content on research: BFU (pre-passcode, limited access, no Wi-Fi/FaceID); AFU (post-unlock, decrypted data); SEP for
  crypto; sources like c4dt.epfl.ch. Link to prior knowledge (iOS encryption).


  Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'':
