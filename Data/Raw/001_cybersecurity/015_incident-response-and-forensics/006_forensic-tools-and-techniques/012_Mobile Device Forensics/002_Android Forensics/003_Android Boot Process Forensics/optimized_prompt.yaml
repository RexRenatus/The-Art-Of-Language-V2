active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the forensic risks of tampering at early boot stages (e.g., SBL or XBL)
    versus later stages (e.g., init or Zygote). How does Verified Boot mitigate these, and what artifacts would you prioritize
    collecting? Support with real-world examples from breaches.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''SBL loads kernel'' vs. actual
    XBL); 2) Related but incorrect term (e.g., ''PBL'' instead of ''SBL''); 3) Partial truth (e.g., ''dm-verity only checks
    apps'' vs. partitions). Ensure distractors test subtle understanding, avoid obvious errors.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Android Boot Process Forensics
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Forensic Tools and Techniques > 009_Mobile Device
  Forensics > Android Forensics > Android Boot Process Forensics). Use the provided Learning Objectives, Active Learning activities,
  4-Layer Scaffolding, and Flashcard Schema to create optimized, university-level flashcards.


  Content Foundation (from web research and voter consensus): Android boot from power-on (Boot ROM/PBL → SBL → XBL/TrustZone
  → aboot/ABL → Kernel (dm-verity) → Init → Zygote). Verified Boot ensures chain integrity; dm-verity verifies partitions;
  forensics via fastboot/EDL/logcat/dmesg//proc/last_kmsg/veritysetup. Address completeness: Detail all stages'' forensic
  artifacts (e.g., SBL auth logs, kernel hash fails).


  Generate 50 flashcards strictly following the Flashcard Schema JSON format. Distribute across Bloom levels and layers per
  schema. Incorporate active learning (e.g., reference discussions). Ensure voter priorities: Full stages, forensics focus,
  pedagogy progression. Output ONLY the JSON array of flashcards.'
