active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the effectiveness of HttpOnly flags against modern attacks like the 'Cookie Sandwich' technique,
    referencing RFC 6265 (strict parsing) versus draft-ietf-httpbis-layered-cookies-01 (layered cookie vulnerabilities). Consider
    real-world implications for browser forensics.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Plausible misconceptions (e.g., confuse HttpOnly with Secure flag)
    - 'Common errors (e.g., wrong DB path: Chrome vs. Firefox)'
    - Edge cases (e.g., expired cookie as active session)
    - Attack variants (e.g., XSS vs. Cookie Sandwich)
    - Avoid obvious wrongs; base on real standards/forensics pitfalls
