active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between whitelisting allowed paths (proactive prevention)
    versus blacklisting traversal sequences (reactive detection) in a forensic context. Consider evasion techniques like double
    URL encoding and how they impact log analysis reliability. Support arguments with OWASP guidelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Forensic Tools and Techniques > 011_Web and Application
  Forensics > Web Attack Investigation > Path Traversal Attack Detection). Generate 50-75 high-quality flashcards using the
  provided schema.


  **Incorporate Pedagogy:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list above]. Ensure cards map to these (label each with Bloom''s level).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers + prior knowledge [Insert full scaffolding above].

  - Active Learning Tie-ins: Include 5-10 cards prompting discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving (e.g., ''Debate: Whitelisting
  vs. blacklisting?'').

  - Voter Consensus: Emphasize completeness (log analysis for ../,%2e%2e/, WAF rules, best practices: canonicalization, whitelisting,
  numerical indexes); forensics tools (grep, Splunk, ELK, Snort); IOCs.

  - Research Context: Base on OWASP (CRS rules), NIST, web sources (e.g., PHP vuln examples, Apache logs).


  **Flashcard Generation Rules:**

  - Use exact schema: Front (question), Back (answer + explanation + distractors for MCQ + hints + source).

  - Distractor Protocol: [Insert full protocol above].

  - Variety: 40% Remember/Understand (defs, examples), 30% Apply/Analyze (log ID, comparisons), 20% Evaluate, 10% Create (design
  rules).

  - Forensics Focus: 60% on detection (logs, tools), 40% prevention/integration.

  - Output Format: JSON array of objects: [{''type'': ''Definition'', ''bloom'': ''Remember'', ''layer'': ''1'', ''front'':
  ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''A'', ''B'', ''C''], ''hints'': ''...'',
  ''source'': ''OWASP''}}].


  Generate now, ensuring university-level rigor, active recall, and spaced repetition optimization.'
