  ## OneDrive Evidence Examination

  OneDrive forensics targets local sync artifacts, registry, logs/DBs, and cloud audits for data exfil/insider threats.

  ### Core Concepts: [As in scaffolding Layer 1].

  ### Artifacts [Layer 2]: File system (%USERPROFILE%\OneDrive; %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\OneDrive\settings\[Personal|Business1]\Preferences.db
  (sync metadata, files), ActivityCache.db; \logs\[Personal|Business1]\*.log); Registry HKCU\Software\Microsoft\OneDrive\Accounts\[Personal|Business1]
  (UserEmail: str; UserFolder: path; LastSignInTime: FILETIME e.g., 0x01d3a5b2c3d4e5f6); Business supports multi-accounts.

  ### Procedures [Layer 3]: Use MFTEB/Autopsy for parsing; convert FILETIME; timeline with logs DBs.

  ### Advanced [Layer 4]: M365 audits/Graph API for cloud-only/deleted files; tools: FTK, RegRipper; cases: breach timelines.

  Generate per flashcard_schema: JSON array. Cover all objectives/layers evenly. Questions test progression: simple recall
  (Layer1) to scenario analysis (Layer4). MCQs: 1 correct, 3 distractors per protocol. Explanations reference artifacts/sources/Bloom''s.
  Ensure accuracy, no fabrication.'
