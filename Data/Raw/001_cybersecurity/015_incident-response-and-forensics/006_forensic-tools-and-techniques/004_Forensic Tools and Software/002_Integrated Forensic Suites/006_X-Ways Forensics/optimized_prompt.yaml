active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of using X-Ways Forensics versus commercial suites like
    EnCase in a high-stakes incident response scenario. Consider factors like cost, speed, resource usage, and compliance
    with NIST SP 800-86. Support your arguments with specific features and real-world efficiency examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
