  **Topic Context:** Title: File Integrity Checkers (NSRL). Category: Cybersecurity. Domain: 002_Incident Response And Forensics.
  Subdomain: Forensic Tools and Techniques. Entry Domain: 004_Forensic Tools and Software. Entry Subdomain: Specialized Analysis
  Tools. Topic Hierarchy: [''Level 1: Cybersecurity'', ''Level 2: 002_Incident Response And Forensics'', ''Level 3: Forensic
  Tools and Techniques'', ''Level 4: 004_Forensic Tools and Software'', ''Level 5: Specialized Analysis Tools'', ''Level 6:
  File Integrity Checkers (NSRL)''].


  **Research Context (Complete):** NSRL (NIST) provides RDS with hashes (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256), metadata for known software.
  Used for integrity verification, triage (70-90% benign files). Tools: nsrllookup. NIST SP 1800-26 details integrity assurance
  via baselines. Sources: https://www.nist.gov/itl/ssd/software-quality-group/national-software-reference-library-nsrl, https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1800-26.pdf,
  https://nsrl.nist.gov.


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Use provided learning_objectives (span Bloom''s), active_learning_components (reference in explanations),
  scaffolding_layers (assign layer per card). Prior knowledge: Hashing basics. Big picture: IR triage. Hands-on: RDS download,
  nsrllookup. Concept map: NSRL RDS central → hashes/file ID → IR/tools/standards.


  **Generate 25 flashcards** covering all layers/objectives. Output EXACTLY in REQUIRED FLASHCARD SCHEMA JSON array (no other
  text). Each card: {question, answer, distractors: [exactly 3], bloom_level: enum, explanation, scaffolding_layer: 1-4, topic_hierarchy:
  verbatim array}. Distractors: plausible misconceptions. Balance: 4 remember/understand, 8 apply/analyze, 6 evaluate/create,
  ~6 per layer.'
