active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast Google Cloud Security Command Center (SCC) with other cloud security tools like
    AWS GuardDuty or Azure Security Center. Which features make SCC particularly effective for incident response in multi-cloud
    environments, and what are potential limitations? Support your arguments with references to NIST standards and real-world
    attack surface reduction.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate this research context: SCC is a centralized platform for vulnerability/threat reporting, consolidating findings
  (threats, vulnerabilities, misconfigurations) across cloud assets. Supports NIST, HIPAA compliance. Key services: Vulnerability
  Detection, Threat Detection (DDoS, malware), Security Health Analytics, Event Threat Detection.
