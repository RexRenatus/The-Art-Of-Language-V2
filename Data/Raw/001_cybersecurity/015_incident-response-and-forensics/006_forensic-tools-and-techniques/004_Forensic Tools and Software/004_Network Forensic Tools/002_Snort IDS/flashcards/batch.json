      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Snort 3.0's rewritten TCP handling improves how it reconstructs and tracks TCP sessions. Because TCP can be complex (e.g., out-of-order packets, fragmentation), a better handling mechanism allows Snort to more accurately inspect the full session content, leading to more reliable detection.",

They can now follow the nuances, correct misunderstandings (fragmentation/reordering), and accurately capture the full meaning (payload) of what's being said."
