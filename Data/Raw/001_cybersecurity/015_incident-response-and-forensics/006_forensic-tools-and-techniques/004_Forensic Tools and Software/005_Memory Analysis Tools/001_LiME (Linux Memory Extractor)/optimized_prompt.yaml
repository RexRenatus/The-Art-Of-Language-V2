active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast LiME with other memory acquisition tools like Volatility or DumpIt in terms of forensic
    soundness, speed, and compatibility with Linux/Android. Debate scenarios where LiME is preferable, such as live response
    on production servers.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Conceptual (partial truth, e.g., ''Modifies RAM heavily''), 3) Technical (wrong command/param, e.g., ''format=raw''
    vs. ''lime''). Ensure plausibility from real-world errors or tools like DumpIt.'

  Context: Use the provided learning_objectives, active_learning components, scaffolding layers, and flashcard_schema exactly.
  Incorporate voter consensus (82.9% approval), research (LiME: LKM for Linux/Android RAM dumps; minimal footprint; formats:
  lime/raw; network TCP/UDP; integrates with Volatility; NIST/ISO standards), prerequisites (volatile memory, Linux kernel,
  DFIR basics), big picture (IR acquisition for ephemeral evidence), and engagement strategies.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following the flashcard_schema. Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''MCQ|Q/A'', ''bloom_level'':
  ''REMEMBER|...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': 1-4, ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''correct_answer'': ''...'', ''distractors'':
  [''A: ...'', ''B: ...'', ''C: ...''], ''explanation'': ''...'', ''source_reference'': ''...'', ''active_learning_tie'':
