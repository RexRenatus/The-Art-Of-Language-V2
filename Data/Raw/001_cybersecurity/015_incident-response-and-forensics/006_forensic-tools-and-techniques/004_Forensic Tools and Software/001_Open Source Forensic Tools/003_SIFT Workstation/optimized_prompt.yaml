active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a high-stakes corporate incident response, debate the pros and cons of relying solely on open-source
    tools like SIFT Workstation versus commercial suites. Consider factors like cost, customization, legal admissibility,
    performance, and community support. How does SIFT address common misconceptions about open-source reliability?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    knowledge (e.g., ''SIFT is a hardware device''). 3) Related but incorrect (e.g., commercial tool names). 4) Voter misconceptions
    (e.g., ''SIFT requires Windows''). Ensure 1 correct answer clearly superior.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in SIFT Workstation (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Forensic Tools and Techniques > 004_Forensic Tools and
  Software > Open Source Forensic Tools > SIFT Workstation).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives: [insert learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: Use activities for context in explanations (e.g., ''Relates to peer teaching on Volatility'').

  - Scaffolding: [insert scaffolding_layers here]. Tag cards by layer.

  - Prioritize voter consensus: Hands-on tools (Autopsy, Volatility, Wireshark), NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 (full phases), SP 800-86
  integration, pros/cons debates.


  Research Context: SIFT is a free Ubuntu VM from SANS with 100+ open-source DFIR tools for forensics/IR, matching commercial
  suites. Key: Digital forensics (preserve/analyze evidence), IR (NIST phases). Sources: sans.org/sift, nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/86/final,
  nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/61/r2/final.


  Generate flashcards per schema: [insert flashcard_schema here].


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 60 flashcards, grouped by object {''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''...'', ''cards'': [array
  of card objects]}. Ensure high-quality, measurable, active recall.'
