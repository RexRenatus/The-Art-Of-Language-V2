active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the impact of a broken chain of custody in a high-profile cybercrime case, such as the SolarWinds
    hack. What authentication failures led to evidence inadmissibility, and how could they have been prevented using SHA-256
    hashes, digital signatures, and write-blockers?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors from: 1) Common misconceptions (MD5 sufficient, chain optional internally, auth=acquisition);
    2) Partial truths (e.g., ''SHA-1'' instead of SHA-256); 3) Real-world failure modes (e.g., ''No write-blocker used'');
    4) Confusions with related concepts (e.g., encryption vs. hashing). Ensure plausible for cybersecurity learners.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Authentication of Digital
  Evidence'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Forensic Tools and Techniques > 002_003_Legal
