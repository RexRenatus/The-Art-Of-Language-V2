active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast the IT-focused approach in NIST SP 800-86 with traditional law enforcement forensics.
    In what scenarios would prioritizing speed over chain-of-custody be ethically justifiable? Provide examples from real-world
    incidents (e.g., ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure) and debate the implications for legal compliance and operational
    recovery.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions: 1) Literal misinterpretation
    (e.g., confusing IT forensics with law enforcement chain-of-custody); 2) Overlap errors (e.g., mixing Containment with
    Eradication); 3) Partial truths (e.g., omitting post-incident lessons learned). Ensure distractors are realistic from
    voter feedback and research (e.g., speed vs. compliance trade-offs).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST standards. Generate
  40-50 high-quality flashcards on ''NIST SP 800-86 Guidelines'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And
  Forensics > Forensic Tools and Techniques > 002_003_Legal and Compliance Aspects > Professional Standards > NIST SP 800-86
  Guidelines). Cover all elements below for university-level pedagogy (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, 4-layer scaffolding).
  Ensure completeness: Include full Post-Incident Activities (lessons learned, policy updates, forensic reviews); forensic
  sources (systems, networks, storage, devices); IT vs. law enforcement focus; links to NIST SP 800-61 prerequisites and NISTIR
  8428 OT DFIR.
