active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical and legal challenges of forensic decryption in encrypted messaging
    investigations (e.g., warrant requirements under NIST guidelines). How does this balance public safety with privacy rights?
    Provide real-world examples from cases involving Signal or Telegram.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Use these EXACT learning objectives [insert full list above], active learning components [insert summaries], and 4-layer
  scaffolding [insert full layers] to generate 75 high-quality flashcards. Ensure coverage: 20% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25%
  Layer 3, 30% Layer 4; span all Bloom''s levels.


  Incorporate research context: Core concepts (E2EE in Signal/WhatsApp/Telegram, SQLite DBs, SQLCipher keys); NIST SP 800-53
  (controls like SC-8 for confidentiality), SP 800-86 (forensics integration); tools (Autopsy, Signal-CLI, Magnet AXIOM, Cellebrite);
  challenges (key cracking, chain-of-custody).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each matching this schema: {''id'': 1, ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'':
  ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'', ''opt3''] (if MCQ), ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'':
  ''...'', ''active_learning_link'': ''...''}}. Vary types: 40% MCQ (4 options), 30% Q&A, 20% cloze, 10% scenario/application.
  Follow distractor protocol strictly. Make explanations pedagogical, tying to objectives for active recall.'
