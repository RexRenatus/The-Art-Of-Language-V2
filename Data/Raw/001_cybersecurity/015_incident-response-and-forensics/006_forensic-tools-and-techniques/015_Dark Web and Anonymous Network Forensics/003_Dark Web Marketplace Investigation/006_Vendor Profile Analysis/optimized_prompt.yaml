active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical and legal considerations of monitoring dark web vendor profiles
    for incident response. How does this balance proactive threat hunting with privacy rights? Support arguments with references
    to NIST SP 800-61 and real-world cases like the takedown of AlphaBay.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    metric vs. illicit reputation), (2) Mismatched contexts (TPRM legitimate vendors vs. dark web sellers), (3) Tool misapplications

    profiles). Ensure distractors are realistic to promote active recall and error-based learning.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in 'Vendor Profile Analysis'\
  \ within the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Forensic Tools and Techniques > Dark\
  \ Web and Anonymous 008_Network Forensics > Dark Web Marketplace Investigation > Vendor Profile Analysis. Focus exclusively\
  \ on forensic analysis of illicit vendor (seller) profiles on dark web marketplaces (e.g., usernames, PGP keys, sales history,\
  \ feedback scores) for threat intelligence, attribution, and incident response—NOT general third-party risk management (TPRM)\
  \ for legitimate vendors.\n\nIncorporate these pedagogical elements:\n- Learning Objectives: [REMEMBER: Define components;\
  \ UNDERSTAND: Role in IR; APPLY: Use tools; ANALYZE: Relationships; EVALUATE: Reliability; CREATE: Playbook]\n- Scaffolding:\
  \ Layer 1 (Foundation terms), Layer 2 (Components/relationships), Layer 3 (Tools/procedures: Tor, Maltego, PGP verification),\
  \ Layer 4 (Integration with NIST SP 800-61 IR phases, network forensics, ML clustering).\n- Active Learning Tie-ins: Flashcards\
  \ should support discussion (ethics), peer teaching (tools), problem-solving (scenarios).\n- Standards: NIST CSF (Identify/Protect),\
  \ NIST SP 800-61 (full incident handling), NIST SP 800-161 (supply chain adapted to dark web threats). Tools: Tor Browser,\
  \ Maltego, Memex. Sources: Academic papers on darknet markets (e.g., AlphaBay analysis).\n\nGenerate flashcards using this\
