active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical and legal challenges of collecting marketplace artifacts from
    dark web sites versus legitimate e-commerce platforms. Support your arguments with references to NIST SP 800-61 incident
    response phases and real-world case studies (e.g., Silk Road investigations).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in 'Marketplace Artifact Identification'\
  \ (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Forensic Tools and Techniques > Dark Web and Anonymous\
  \ 008_Network Forensics > Dark Web Marketplace Investigation > Marketplace Artifact Identification).\n\nIncorporate these\

  - Voter compliance: Action verbs, measurable, schema exact (no extra fields).\n- Adult/offensive OK if contextual (e.g.,\
  \ illicit markets), but no promotion.\n\nOutput ONLY the JSON array of flashcards."
