active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a corporate incident response scenario, how might RF interference from a rogue device masquerade as
    legitimate traffic? What spectrum analysis techniques (e.g., spectrograms, waterfalls) would you use to differentiate
    it? Debate the trade-offs between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands for forensic analysis, including prerequisites like channel
    overlap and regulatory constraints.
  peer_teaching: Pair students to explain the differences between management frames (e.g., authentication, association) and
    data frames using captured Wireshark packets from a Wi-Fi network. One student teaches the concepts and demonstrates spectrum
    correlation; the partner quizzes them and switches roles.
  problem_solving: Provide a real-world spectrum capture file (e.g., from inSSIDer showing jamming or rogue AP interference).
    Students diagnose the anomaly step-by-step (identify source, correlate with packet data), propose mitigations (e.g., channel
    changes, WIDS/WIPS deployment), and justify using NIST IR lifecycle phases.

    frames with data frames; overlook physical layer in Wi-Fi security).

    - Distractors grounded in research/voter suggestions (e.g., ''Encryption only secures Wi-Fi'' as distractor).

    - Ensure distractors are realistic but identifiable via explanation.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Wi-Fi Spectrum Analysis
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Forensic Tools and Techniques > 008_Network Forensics
  > Wireless > Wi-Fi Spectrum Analysis).


  Prerequisites: OSI model, TCP/IP, 802.11 basics, Wireshark.

  Big Picture: Essential for NIST IR phases, detecting physical layer threats (jamming, rogues).


  Use these EXACT learning objectives [insert learning_objectives array], active learning activities [insert active_learning
  object], and 4-layer scaffolding [insert scaffolding object excluding sources] to ensure comprehensive coverage.


  Generate flashcards per this SCHEMA [insert flashcard_schema object].


  Distribute evenly: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4. Span Bloom''s levels proportionally.

  Incorporate real tools (Wireshark, inSSIDer, Wi-Spy), standards (IEEE 802.11, NIST), and voter-suggested scenarios (rogue
  interference, band trade-offs).


  Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'',
  ''source'': ''...''}].

  Ensure active recall, no hints on front, explanations promote deep understanding.'
