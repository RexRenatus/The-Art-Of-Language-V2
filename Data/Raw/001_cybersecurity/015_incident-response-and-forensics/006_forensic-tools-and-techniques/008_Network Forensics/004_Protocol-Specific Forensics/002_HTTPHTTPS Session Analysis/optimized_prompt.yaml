active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Using OWASP WSTG and a real-world case study (e.g., a web app breach like the 2017 Equifax incident),
    debate the most critical tests for preventing session hijacking versus CSRF. Which is more impactful in network forensics,
    and why? Support with NIST SP 800-63-3 evidence.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules: 'For MCQs, generate 3 plausible distractors: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse session fixation with hijacking),
      2) Related but incorrect term (e.g., ''cookie'' vs. ''token''), 3) Partial truth (e.g., valid for HTTP but not HTTPS).
      Base on real pitfalls from OWASP/NIST. Mark correct option first in ''options'' array.'
    examples: 'Q: What ensures a session secret resists guessing? A: Sufficient entropy. Distractors: ''Short length'', ''Predictable
      generation'', ''HTTPS only''.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in network forensics. Generate
  50 high-quality flashcards on ''HTTP/HTTPS Session Analysis'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And
  Forensics > Forensic Tools and Techniques > 008_Network Forensics > Protocol-Specific Forensics > HTTP/HTTPS Session Analysis).
  Focus on forensic techniques: Wireshark/tshark/tcpflow for reconstruction, TLS decryption, OWASP WSTG tests, NIST SP 800-63-3
  guidelines, CybOX HTTP Session Objects.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert full scaffolding above] – distribute flashcards evenly.

  - Active Learning: Tie explanations to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving.


  Use exact Flashcard Schema: JSON array of objects with ''id'', ''front'', ''back'', ''type'' (''basic'' or ''mcq''), ''options''
  (MCQ only, correct first), ''explanation'', ''bloom_level'', ''tags'', ''scaffolding_layer''. Follow distractor protocol
  strictly.


  Ensure progression: Foundation terms first, then tools, standards, advanced integration. Make measurable/active (e.g., ''In
  Wireshark, filter for...''). Output ONLY the JSON array, no extra text.'
