active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using scheduled tasks for legitimate automation versus
    their risks as a malware persistence vector. How do the benefits for sysadmins compare to the stealth advantages for attackers?
    Cite MITRE T1053 examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Base on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse T1053 with T1547 Boot/Logon Autostart)
    - Use similar MITRE IDs/techniques (e.g., T1053.002 At vs T1053.005 Scheduled Task)
    - Incorporate platform differences (e.g., Windows-only vs cross-platform)
    - Draw from real-world variants (e.g., benign task vs Emotet payload)
    - 'Ensure plausibility: 70% accurate but wrong context/application'

  **Completed Research Context:** Scheduled tasks (Windows: Task Scheduler/schtasks.exe; Linux: cron/at/systemd; macOS: launchd;
  Containers: kubectl cronjobs) are abused for persistence (T1053), execution, escalation. Sub-techniques: T1053.005 (Scheduled
  Task), T1053.003 (Cron), T1053.002 (At), T1053.007 (Container). Detection: Sysmon (proc create Image: schtasks.exe, CommandLine
  anomalies), Event ID 4698/4700-4703, Autoruns, process lineage. Best practices: Monitor schtasks.exe spawns, obfuscated
  CLIs (e.g., /tr ''cmd /c malicious.bat''), enable logs. Examples: Emotet creates tasks post-phishing. Evasion: HighestRunLevel,
  hidden tasks. Sources: MITRE ATT&CK (attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/), SANS (sans.org), SigmaHQ rules.


  **Prior Knowledge:** OS scheduling, basic persistence (e.g., registry Run keys).


  Incorporate these EXACT learning objectives [paste learning_objectives array]. Use scaffolding layers [paste scaffolding
  array] to structure flashcards progressively.


  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Infuse prompts with discussion-style questions, lab scenarios (e.g., ''In a VM lab, analyze
  this log...'').


  Generate 40-50 flashcards per EXACT flashcard_schema: MCQ format, 4 options, distractors per protocol, full back-side explanation.
  Output ONLY in Anki format: ''Front text ||| Back text'' (one per line, HTML for formatting). Cover all layers evenly, span
  Bloom''s levels. Ensure completeness, accuracy, and educational depth.'
