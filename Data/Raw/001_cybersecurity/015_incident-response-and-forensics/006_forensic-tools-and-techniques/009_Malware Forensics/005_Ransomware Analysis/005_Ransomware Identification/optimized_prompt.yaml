active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, Student A explains core ransomware identification techniques (e.g., high file entropy, ransom notes,
    behavioral indicators like process injection, referencing NIST SP 1800-26); Student B teaches back by applying to a mock
    forensic report and quizzes A. Switch roles after 10 minutes.
  problem_solving: 'Provide a real-world-inspired scenario dataset (logs, file samples with .lockbit extensions, network captures
    showing exfiltration). Task: Classify if it''s ransomware (vs. wiper malware), identify IOCs (e.g., mutexes, CryptoAPI),
    and outline NIST CSF Respond steps. Use safe VM tools like Autopsy or Volatility.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Anki-optimized cards using
  university pedagogy (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Topic: Ransomware Identification (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Forensic Tools and Techniques > 010_Malware Forensics > Ransomware Analysis > Ransomware
  Identification). Voter consensus: 100% approval on pedagogy, completeness, active learning.


  Prerequisites: Basic malware concepts, CIA triad.


  Incorporate these EXACT learning objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE].


  Active learning inspiration: Use elements from discussion/peer_teaching/problem_solving to flavor explanations (e.g., reference
  WannaCry debate).


  Scaffold content across 4 layers: [INSERT scaffolding ARRAY HERE]. Generate cards progressively: Layer 1 basic recall, Layer
  4 synthesis.


  Research context: Ransomware encrypts/locks data (CIA: integrity/availability); indicators (ransom notes README.txt, .locky
  extensions, double extortion, entropy, CryptoAPI, YARA/Volatility); NIST CSF Detect/Respond, SP 1800-26 (Ransomware guide:
  detect via logs/artifacts); Sources: NIST CSF v1.1 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), SP 1800-26 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1800-26.pdf).


  Follow EXACT flashcard schema: [INSERT flashcard_schema HERE].


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcards, no extra text. Ensure high-quality, spaced repetition friendly (active recall,
  no hints in questions).'
