        "core_logic": "Validation is the scientific process of establishing the reliability and accuracy of a forensic tool or technique generally. Verification, often using cryptographic hashes, confirms that a specific data acquisition (like an image) is an exact copy of the original source, ensuring its integrity.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly equate the terms, reverse their relationship, or misattribute their focus, failing to grasp that validation is about the tool's inherent trustworthiness and verification is about the specific data's fidelity.",
        "analogy": "Validation is like certifying a measuring tape is accurate (e.g., meets standards). Verification is like checking if the specific measurement you just took with that tape matches the object's known dimensions."
