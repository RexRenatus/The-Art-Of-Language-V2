active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast logical acquisition with physical acquisition. In what incident response scenarios
    (e.g., considering time constraints, data volatility, legal admissibility, and file system types like NTFS vs. ext4) would
    you choose one over the other? Provide examples from NIST SP 800-61 phases.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ from common misconceptions (e.g., 'Logical acquisition captures unallocated
      space' as distractor).
    - 'Base on pros/cons (e.g., distractor: ''Logical is slower than physical'').'
    - 'Use partial truths (e.g., tool names mixed up: FTK for physical only).'
    - Ensure distractors test analysis/evaluation (e.g., wrong scenario choice).
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in digital forensics. Generate
  high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for the topic ''Logical Acquisition Methods'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident
  Response And Forensics > Forensic Tools and Techniques > 003_Data Acquisition and Preservation > Non-Volatile Data Acquisition
  > Logical Acquisition Methods). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives, active learning (discussion/peer
  teaching/problem-solving), and 4-layer scaffolding.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the learning_objectives array here verbatim].


  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Incorporate hints to activities (e.g., ''Relates to discussion on pros/cons'').


  **Scaffolding Content:** Strictly use these layers for card distribution:

  [Insert scaffolding JSON here verbatim].


  **Big Picture Context:** Logical acquisition fits DFIR workflow (NIST SP 800-61 Detection/Analysis), enables targeted evidence
  collection, ensures court defensibility via hashing. Sources: NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3, FTK Imager docs, EnCase guides.


  **Flashcard Schema:** Follow exactly:

  [Insert flashcard_schema JSON here verbatim].


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"type": "mcq/basic/cloze", "front": "...", "back": "...", "explanation":
  "...", "tags": ["layer1", "remember", "FTK"]}, etc. Generate 50 cards balanced by layer/Bloom. Ensure distractors from protocol.
