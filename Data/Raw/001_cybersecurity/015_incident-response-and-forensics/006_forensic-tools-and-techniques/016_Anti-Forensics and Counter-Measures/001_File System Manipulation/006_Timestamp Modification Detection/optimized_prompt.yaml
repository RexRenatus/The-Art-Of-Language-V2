active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a real-world incident response scenario, how might undetected timestamp modifications lead to incorrect
    attribution of an attack? Debate the trade-offs between speed and thoroughness in timeline reconstruction, considering
    anti-forensics implications.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Incident Response and Forensics.\
  \ Generate high-quality, Anki-optimized flashcards for the topic 'Timestamp Modification Detection' (Category: Cybersecurity,\
  \ Domain: 002_Incident Response And Forensics, Subdomain: Forensic Tools and Techniques, Entry Domain: 016_Anti-Forensics\
  \ and Counter-Measures, Entry Subdomain: File System Manipulation).\n\n**Topic Hierarchy (populate exactly):** ['Cybersecurity',\
  \ '002_Incident Response And Forensics', 'Forensic Tools and Techniques', '016_Anti-Forensics and Counter-Measures', 'File\
  \ System Manipulation', 'Timestamp Modification Detection']\n\n**Core Content (Web-grounded):** Timestomping alters file\
  \ timestamps (MACE: Modified, Access, Creation/Change, Entry Modified) in NTFS to evade forensics. Key artifacts: $MFT (metadata),\
  \ $LogFile (transactions), $USNJrnl (changes). Tools: analyzeMFT, log2timeline, Autopsy. Frameworks: MITRE ATT&CK T1070.006,\
  \ ISO/IEC 27037 (evidence identification/collection). Anti-forensics hides activity; detection reconstructs true timelines.\n\
  \n**Sources:** MITRE ATT&CK (https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/006/), ISO/IEC 27037:2012 (Guidelines for digital\
