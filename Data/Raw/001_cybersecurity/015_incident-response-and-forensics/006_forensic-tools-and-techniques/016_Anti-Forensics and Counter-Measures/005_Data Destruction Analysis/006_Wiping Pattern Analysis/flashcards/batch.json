Therefore, forensic analysts can frequently recover residual data fragments or even entire files using advanced techniques, because the overwrite did not fully obliterate the original magnetic or electronic states.",

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Wiping involves using software to overwrite data, making it a logical process applicable to various media types. Degaussing, conversely, uses a powerful magnetic field to disrupt the magnetic domains on media like HDDs, thus physically destroying the stored data, because it targets the physical storage mechanism.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The correct answer clearly distinguishes wiping (logical, overwriting) from degaussing (physical, magnetic field). The distractors incorrectly assign media types, swap functions, or reverse the logical/physical nature of the processes.",
        "analogy": "Wiping is like using a permanent marker to write over text on a page until it's unreadable. Degaussing is like exposing a magnetic tape to a strong magnet, scrambling the magnetic alignment so the original recording is lost."
