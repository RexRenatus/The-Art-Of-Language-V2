active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the impact of data volatility and anti-forensics techniques on social media
    metadata reliability. Propose 2-3 countermeasures and justify their effectiveness in a cloud-era incident response scenario,
    referencing real-world examples like timestamp discrepancies in Instagram posts.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1 common misconception (e.g., ''Metadata is only user-editable''),
    1 related but incorrect concept (e.g., confuse EXIF with file content), 1 edge-case error (e.g., outdated platform feature).
    Base on research context (volatility, anti-forensics) and voter examples (timestamps, geolocation). Ensure distractors
    teach via negation.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Social Media Metadata
  Examination'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Forensic Tools and Techniques > 012_Communication
  and Social Media Forensics > Social Media Investigation > Social Media Metadata Examination). Voter consensus: 82.9% approval
  on narrowing to metadata techniques (EXIF images, timestamps, geolocation on Twitter/X, Instagram), Bloom''s Taxonomy, 4-layer
  scaffolding, active learning, tools like ExifTool.


  Big Picture Context: SMF metadata is pivotal in cloud-era IR lifecycles for attribution/timelines amid volatility/anti-forensics;
  elevates expertise per research (shodhforensic.com, sytech-consultants.com, swgde.org).
