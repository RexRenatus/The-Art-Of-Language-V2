  Generate a set of 80 high-quality flashcards optimized for university-level pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy progression, active
  learning (discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving), 4 scaffolding layers (Foundation: basics/misconceptions; Components:
  app architecture/data locations e.g., /data/data/com.instagram.android/databases/direct.db, caches; Implementation: steps/tools
  like Autopsy, Magnet AXIOM, Cellebrite, Oxygen Forensics, imaging/SQLite parsing; Integration: NIST SP 800-86, anti-forensics,
  legal/chain of custody, case studies), distractor protocol for MCQs.


  Incorporate: Voter suggestions (completeness: best practices, tools, sources like NIST/SANS; pedagogy: objectives, quizzes);
  Research context (digital forensics defs, IR frameworks, artifacts).


  Use exact schema:

  - **Front**: Question.

  - **Back**: {Answer, Explanation (w/ rationale/objective tie-in/misconception address), Distractors (3 for MCQ), Layer/Bloom
  tags, Source (e.g., NIST SP 800-86)}.


  Distribute: 20% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND (Layers 1-2), 30% APPLY (Layer 3), 30% ANALYZE (Layers 2-3), 20% EVALUATE/CREATE (Layer
  4). Include active learning prompts in 10% explanations. Output as markdown list.'
