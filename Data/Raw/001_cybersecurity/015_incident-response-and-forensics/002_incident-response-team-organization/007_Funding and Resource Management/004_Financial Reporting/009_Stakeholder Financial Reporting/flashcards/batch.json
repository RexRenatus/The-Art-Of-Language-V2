        "core_logic": "NIST SP 800-184 emphasizes that resilience is built through iterative improvement. Learning from past incidents, both internal and external, allows organizations to refine their recovery plans, thereby enhancing their ability to recover critical functions like financial reporting.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors suggest static planning, a narrow IT focus, or over-reliance on external consultants, all contrary to the principle of continuous improvement.",
        "analogy": "Improving recovery planning is like a pilot regularly reviewing flight data and simulator training after each flight; this continuous learning ensures they are better prepared for future challenges."

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Many regulations (like PCI DSS, HIPAA) mandate specific incident detection, response, and reporting procedures. Therefore, effective IR is crucial for meeting these requirements, accurately reporting financial impacts of breaches, and avoiding associated penalties.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly state that compliance negates IR, limit IR scope, or invent exclusive external reporting roles.",
        "analogy": "Meeting regulatory compliance for financial reporting after an incident is like following traffic laws after an accident; it ensures the situation is handled correctly, documented properly, and avoids further penalties."
