      "distractors": [
        {
          "text": "It provides specific technical procedures for conducting media forensic analysis.",
          "misconception": "Targets [framework scope]: Confuses a risk management framework with a technical procedure guide."
        },
        {
          "text": "It mandates the use of specific forensic software tools for all organizations.",
          "misconception": "Targets [mandate vs. guidance]: Misinterprets CSF as a prescriptive tool requirement rather than a flexible framework."

        {
          "text": "It focuses solely on preventing incidents, rendering media forensics unnecessary.",
          "misconception": "Targets [prevention vs. response]: Ignores the reality that incidents still occur and require response and analysis."
        }

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "CSF 2.0 promotes a holistic approach by integrating incident response into risk management because this ensures that preparedness, detection, and recovery efforts are aligned with the organization's overall security posture and objectives.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors misrepresent CSF 2.0 as a technical procedure manual, a tool mandate, or a purely preventative measure, failing to grasp its core concept of integrated risk management for cybersecurity.",
        "analogy": "CSF 2.0 is like a company's overall business strategy document; it ensures that all departments, including the incident response team (media forensics), work together towards common goals, rather than operating in isolation."
