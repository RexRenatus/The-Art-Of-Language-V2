        "core_logic": "The fundamental difference lies in execution: static analysis inspects the malware's structure and code without running it, whereas dynamic analysis observes its actions and effects when it is executed in a controlled environment.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Both methods contribute to understanding purpose; static analysis also uses specialized tools; safety depends on execution and isolation, not just the method type.",
