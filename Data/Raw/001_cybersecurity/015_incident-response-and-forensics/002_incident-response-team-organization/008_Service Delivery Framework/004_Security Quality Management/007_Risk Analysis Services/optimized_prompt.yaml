  Core Content: Risk analysis identifies/assesses/mitigates threats to assets via NIST CSF 2.0 (Govern, Identify, Protect,
  Detect, Respond, Recover) and SP 800-61 Rev. 3 IR phases (Preparation, Detection & Analysis, Containment/Eradication/Recovery,
  Post-Incident Activity). Key terms: Vulnerability (weakness), Threat (potential exploit), Risk (likelihood x impact), Impact
  (harm: financial/reputational/etc.). Use 5x5 matrix for assessment. Integrate with IR teams/service delivery.


  Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r3.pdf),
  NIST SP 800-30 (Risk Assessment).

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the exact array from ''learning_objectives'' above].

  - Active Learning: Use for context in explanations (e.g., reference discussion/peer teaching scenarios).

  - Scaffolding: Layer content across 4 layers as defined [Insert scaffolding_layers descriptions].


  Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards following the EXACT schema: [Insert flashcard_generation_schema details]. Output
  ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects, no extra text. Ensure spaced repetition optimization: Varied question types, progressive
  difficulty matching Bloom''s/scaffolding. Distractors per protocol. Cover prior knowledge (CIA triad) and voter priorities
  (completeness, integration).'
