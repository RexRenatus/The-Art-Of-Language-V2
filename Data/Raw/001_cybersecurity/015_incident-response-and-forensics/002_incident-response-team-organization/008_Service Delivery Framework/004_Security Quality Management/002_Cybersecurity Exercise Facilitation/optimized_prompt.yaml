active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast NIST SP 800-84 TT&E programs with CISA playbooks and MITRE Cyber Exercise Playbook
    in designing a cyber exercise for incident response team organization. Discuss strengths, gaps, and how they address common
    misconceptions like confusing exercises with real incidents.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
