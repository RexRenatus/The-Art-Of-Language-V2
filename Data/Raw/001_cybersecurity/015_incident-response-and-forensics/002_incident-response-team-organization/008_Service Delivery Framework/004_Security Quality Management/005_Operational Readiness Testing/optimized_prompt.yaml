active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of NIST SP 800-84, debate whether full-scale simulations or targeted technical tests are
    more effective for Operational Readiness Testing in incident response teams. Consider resource constraints, team size,
    and real-world applicability. This addresses misconceptions that ORT is only tabletop exercises.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
  additional_activities:
  - 'Role-playing: Simulate an IR team response during ORT, assigning roles (e.g., analyst, manager) to practice forensics
    chain-of-custody.'
  - 'Think-pair-share: Share common gaps in IR readiness (e.g., poor documentation in exercises).'
  - 'Collaborative project: Build a sample ORT checklist, including non-examples like unmeasured drills.'

    NIST misreads) and stem from voter-noted gaps like ''ORT=only tabletops''.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Operational Readiness Testing

  Core Content: ORT verifies IR capabilities via TT&E programs (NIST SP 800-84: Tests like vuln scans; Training like workshops;
  Exercises like simulations). Integrates NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3, CSF 2.0. Addresses forensics (evidence handling), IR team
