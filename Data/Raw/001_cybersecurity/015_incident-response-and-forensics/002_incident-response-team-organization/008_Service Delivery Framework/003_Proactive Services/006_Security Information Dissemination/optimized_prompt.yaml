  discussion_prompt: Debate the ethical and operational trade-offs of rapid vs. measured security information dissemination
    in a ransomware incident affecting CDI—reference NIST SP 800-61r3 phases and prioritize stakeholders (e.g., internal team
    vs. regulators). Consider impacts on forensics chain-of-custody and proactive services.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one explains 'compromise' vs. 'cyber incident' definitions with examples/non-examples (e.g., phishing
    alert as proactive dissemination vs. data breach as incident); switch roles and provide teach-back feedback, linking to
    prior knowledge of NIST 800-61 preparation/detection phases.
  problem_solving: In groups, design a dissemination flowchart for a simulated breach in a Covered Contractor Information
    System, prioritizing stakeholders (internal IR team, executives, regulators) per NIST SP 800-61r3; role-play IR team roles
    in a think-pair-share to address misconceptions like 'all incidents require immediate public disclosure.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on ''Security Information Dissemination''
  in the hierarchy: Cybersecurity (Level 1) → 002_Incident Response And Forensics (Level 2) → 002_Incident Response Team Organization
  (Level 3) → 006_Service Delivery Framework (Entry Level 4) → Proactive Services (Entry Level 5) → Security Information Dissemination
  (Level 6).


  **Research Context:** Use definitions: Cyber Incident (network actions causing compromise/adverse effects), Compromise (unauthorized
  disclosure/violation), CDI (safeguarded unclassified info), Covered Contractor System (handles CDI). NIST SP 800-61r3 dissemination:
  Preparation (comms plans), Detection/Analysis (alerts), Containment/Eradication/Recovery (updates), Post-Incident (reports).
  Big Picture: Reduces impact, forensics chain-of-custody, NIST CSF 2.0 Govern/Identify. Prior Knowledge: IR phases, service
  delivery.
