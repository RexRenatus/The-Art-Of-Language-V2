active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of deploying NIDS versus HIDS in a hybrid cloud environment.
    Consider factors like visibility, performance impact, and evasion techniques. Reference NIST SP 800-94 to support arguments
    and identify when a combined approach with SIEM integration is optimal.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
