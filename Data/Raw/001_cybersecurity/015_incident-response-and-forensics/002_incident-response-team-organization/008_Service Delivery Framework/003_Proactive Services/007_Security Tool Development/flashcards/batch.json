        "core_logic": "The preparation phase is foundational because it sets the stage for effective incident response. Developing or selecting appropriate tools during this phase is critical, as they are the mechanisms through which policies and procedures are executed.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly minimize the role of tools in preparation, suggesting they are secondary, acquired reactively, or only relevant to containment, rather than being integral to the entire proactive process.",
        "analogy": "The 'preparation' phase in incident response, supported by tool development, is like a firefighter gathering and checking their equipment (hoses, ladders, breathing apparatus) before a fire alarm sounds, ensuring they are ready to act effectively."
