active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 (and draft Rev. 3), debate the role of Technology Watch in proactive
    Incident Response Team Organization. How can monitoring emerging technologies like OT DFIR challenges (e.g., ICS-specific
    threats) prevent incidents? Provide pros/cons, real-world examples from recent breaches (e.g., ransomware in industrial
    controls), and links to CSF 2.0 alignment. Divide into teams to argue for/against mandatory Technology Watch roles in
    all IR teams.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Use this research context: Technology Watch is proactive monitoring of emerging technologies/threats for IR preparedness
  (NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 phases: Preparation/Detection; draft Rev. 3 aligns IR with CSF 2.0 full lifecycle). Core concepts:
  IR (detect/respond), DFIR (evidence handling), OT DFIR (ICS challenges, NIST IR 8428). Sources: NIST SP 800-61r2 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-61r2.pdf),
  CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), NIST IR 8428 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8428.pdf).
