active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of using TLS 1.3 (RFC 8446) versus older protocols like TLS 1.2 for internal incident
    response communications, considering factors such as speed, security enhancements, backward compatibility, and real-world
    NIST Respond function alignment.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Authenticity) with incident response
    examples (e.g., encrypting forensics reports); the partner teaches it back using a non-example like unencrypted Slack
    or email, then switch roles and provide feedback.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario where a team's Slack channel was breached during an incident (exposing sensitive data),
    design a secure alternative communication channel using tools like Signal, Matrix, or GPG. Justify choices based on CIA
    principles, relevant RFCs (e.g., TLS 1.3 RFC 8446, SSH RFC 4251), and NIST guidelines, then present and peer-review solutions.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom's Taxonomy, active\
  \ learning, and scaffolding. Generate 20 high-quality flashcards on 'Secure Communication Channels' (Topic Hierarchy: ['Cybersecurity',\
  \ '002_Incident Response And Forensics', '002_Incident Response Team Organization', '005_Communication and Coordination',\
  \ 'Internal Communication', 'Secure Communication Channels']). Strictly use this hierarchy without alteration.\n\nIncorporate:\n\
  - Learning Objectives: [REMEMBER: List CIA... (paste full list)]\n- Active Learning: Inspire questions from discussion (TLS\
  \ trade-offs), peer teaching (CIA examples), problem-solving (Slack breach redesign).\n- Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards\
  \ across 4 layers (5 each): Layer 1 Foundation (CIA, basics), Layer 2 Components (RFCs: TLS 8446, SSH 4251, IPsec 4301,\
  \ S/MIME), Layer 3 Implementation (Signal, GPG), Layer 4 Integration (NIST Respond, design).\n- Prior Knowledge: Relate\
  \ to HTTPS, email.\n- Big Picture: NIST Respond for leak-free IR coordination.\n- Tools/Examples: Signal, Matrix, GPG.\n\
  \nOutput ONLY a JSON array of 20 flashcards, each matching this EXACT schema:\n{\n  \"question\": \"...\",\n  \"answer\"\
