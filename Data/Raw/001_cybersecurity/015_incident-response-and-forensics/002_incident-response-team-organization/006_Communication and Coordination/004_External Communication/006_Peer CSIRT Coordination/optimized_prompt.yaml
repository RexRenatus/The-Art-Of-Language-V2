active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of unrestricted threat intelligence sharing between peer
    CSIRTs (e.g., speed vs. legal risks like data privacy laws). Use real-world examples like the WannaCry ransomware response
    to support arguments and propose mitigation strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    vs. peer CSIRT); 2) Based on voter-noted misconceptions (e.g., ignoring legal constraints); 3) Drawn from adjacent topics
    (e.g., mix with internal IR phases); 4) Plausible alternatives from other frameworks. Ensure 60% target higher Bloom''s
    levels (apply/analyze).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Peer CSIRT Coordination
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response Team Organization > 005_Communication
  and Coordination > External Communication > Peer CSIRT Coordination).


  Incorporate this research context: Peer CSIRT coordination enables collective incident management beyond org boundaries.
  Key terms: CSIRT (handles incidents per policy), Peer CSIRT (external collaborators), Coordination (info exchange for detection/analysis/response),
  Threat Intel. Standards: NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 (IR in CSF 2.0 risk mgmt), FIRST framework, EUCSIRT. Best practices: MoUs/ISAs,
  IODEF templates, tools (MISP, STIX/TAXII), classify data, legal compliance. Case studies: WannaCry, SolarWinds. Prerequisites:
  CSIRT roles, NIST IR phases. Misconceptions: Free sharing ignores laws.
