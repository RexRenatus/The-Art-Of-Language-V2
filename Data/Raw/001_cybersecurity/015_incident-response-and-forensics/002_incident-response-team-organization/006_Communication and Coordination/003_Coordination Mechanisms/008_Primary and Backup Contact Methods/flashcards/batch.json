      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The primary contact method should be the most reliable and efficient for routine use and initial alerts because it's the first line of communication. This ensures quick response and coordination, functioning as the default channel when available.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The correct answer focuses on reliability and efficiency for the primary channel.
