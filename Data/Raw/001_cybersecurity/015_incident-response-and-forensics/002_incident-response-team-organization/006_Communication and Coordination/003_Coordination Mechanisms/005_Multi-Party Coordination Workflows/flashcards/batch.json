        "core_logic": "Defining clear roles and responsibilities in multi-party coordination is paramount because it establishes accountability, prevents redundant efforts, and streamlines decision-making processes. This clarity ensures that each party knows their specific contribution, leading to a more cohesive and effective response, as advocated by incident management best practices.",
