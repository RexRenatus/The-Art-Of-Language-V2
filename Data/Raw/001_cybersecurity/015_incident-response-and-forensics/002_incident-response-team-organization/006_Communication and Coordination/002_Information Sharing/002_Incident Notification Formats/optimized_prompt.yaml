      vs. distractor ''Critical/Warning/Error/Fatal'' from logging contexts).'
    - Use near-misses from standards (e.g., NIST fields vs. ITIL or ISO 27001 variants).
    - Incorporate real-world errors (e.g., omitting timestamps as 'optional').
    - Ensure one distractor is a 'superficially correct but incomplete' option.
    - 'Balance difficulty: 1 easy (obvious wrong), 2 medium (confusable terms), 1 hard (subtle nuance).'

  **Core Content Summary (Web-Grounded Research):** Incident notifications inform stakeholders of cybersecurity events for
  coordinated response (NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2/3). Key elements: Incident ID, Date/Time, Reporter, Description, Severity (e.g.,
  High/Critical), Affected Assets, Impact, Actions Taken, Next Steps. Templates from NIST SP 800-61 (p. 3-17 to 3-20); integrate
  with CSF 2.0 (RS.CO-2). OT specifics (NISTIR 7621/8428): Prioritize safety, delayed notifications. Legal: CISA 72-hr reporting.

  **Pedagogy Integration:** Generate 50 flashcards progressing through Bloom''s levels and 4 scaffolding layers. Use provided
  objectives, active learning, and schema. Ensure university-style: active recall, spaced repetition friendly.


  **Generation Rules:**

  - 40% Remember/Understand (Layers 1-2).

  - 30% Apply/Analyze (Layer 3).

  - 30% Evaluate/Create (Layer 4).

  - Follow exact flashcard schema: Multiple choice/cloze on front; structured back with explanation, tags.

  - Distractors per protocol.

  - Tie to active learning (e.g., ''Apply in problem-solving exercise'').
