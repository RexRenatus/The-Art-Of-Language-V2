active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of implementing an Indirect Authority Model versus a
    direct hierarchical model during a high-stakes ransomware incident affecting critical infrastructure. Use NIST SP 800-61
    Rev. 3 to support your arguments and consider scalability in OT environments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For multiple-choice (4 options always): 1 correct, 3 distractors. Distractors must be plausible based
    on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse with direct authority, NIST CSF vs. SP 800-61, OT vs. IT specifics). Source distractors
    from: 1) Opposite concepts (direct vs. indirect), 2) Related but incorrect frameworks (e.g., NIST CSF instead of 800-61),
    3) Edge cases (e.g., single-point failure myths). Ensure distractors teach by elimination.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Topic: ''Indirect Authority Model'' (Level 6 in hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response Team Organization > 001_Governance and Authority > Authority
  Levels > Indirect Authority Model). NOTE: This is NOT a standard term—synthesize as ''Delegated Authority Model in IRTs''
  per NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 (structured incident handling via protocols/playbooks/escalation, not direct command) and NISTIR
  8428 (OT DFIR).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the array above]

  - Active Learning: Use elements to inspire higher-order cards (e.g., scenario prompts from exercises).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers [reference layers above]; start simple, build complexity.

  - Prior knowledge: Builds on ''Authority Levels'' (direct hierarchies).

  - Concept map integration: Cards linking ''Indirect Authority Model'' to IRT Delegation, Escalation Paths, Playbooks, IRT
  Organization, Project Management.


  Generate flashcards following EXACT schema: [paste flashcard_schema above]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, e.g.,
  [{''type'':..., ''front'':..., ''back'':{...}}, ...]. Ensure 20-30 cards: 5-8 per Bloom''s level, balanced layers. High
  accuracy: Cite NIST sources; distractors per protocol. Optimize for Anki/Quizlet: concise fronts, rich backs for spaced
  repetition and active recall.'
