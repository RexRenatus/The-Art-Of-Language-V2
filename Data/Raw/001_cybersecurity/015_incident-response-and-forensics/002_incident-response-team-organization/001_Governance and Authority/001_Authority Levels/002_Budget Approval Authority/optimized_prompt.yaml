active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a ransomware incident requiring immediate forensics tools, should budget approval authority be delegated
    to the Incident Response Lead or require C-level sign-off? Debate the pros and cons using the NIST CSF 2.0 Govern function,
    considering trade-offs in speed versus oversight.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1. Common misconception (e.g., ''IR Lead has unlimited authority'');
    2. Confusable role/framework (e.g., ''Department of War'' instead of ''Defense''); 3. Partial truth/extreme (e.g., ''No
    approval needed in emergencies''). Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter-noted errors and research.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Incident Response. Topic:
  Budget Approval Authority (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response Team Organization
  > 001_Governance and Authority > Authority Levels > Budget Approval Authority). Use provided research: NIST CSF 2.0 Govern
  (resource oversight), NIST SP 800-61 (IR roles), DoD CIO Cybersecurity Resource and Reference Guide (Department of Defense,
  critical IR functions). Fix errors: ''Department of Defense'' not ''War''. Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (Jan 2025 update), NIST
  SP 800-61, DoD CIO Guide.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste array above].

  - Active Learning: Embed concepts from discussion/activities into flashcards (e.g., ransomware scenarios).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute across 4 layers [paste scaffolding above]; tag each card.

  - Big picture: Rapid IR resource deployment, governance-operational integration, reduced MTTR; link to prereq ''Authority
  Levels''.

  - Voter consensus: 55.7% approval; prioritize accuracy/completeness/pedagogy.


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards following exact schema [paste schema above]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards:
