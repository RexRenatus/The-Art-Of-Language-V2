      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The fundamental difference lies in the scope of control and the associated complexities; internal escalation operates within established organizational hierarchies and policies, whereas cross-organizational escalation necessitates navigating different governance structures, legal frameworks, and communication protocols, because external entities are not under direct command.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors make incorrect assumptions about management involvement, the types of incidents requiring external escalation, and the formality of procedures, missing the core distinction of control and complexity.",
