active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the consequences of poor escalation paths using a real-world example like
    the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident. What triggers should have escalated it faster to executive levels, and
    how could NIST CSF 2.0 GV.OC-05 have improved outcomes? Support with evidence from frameworks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Common errors from research (e.g., ignore time triggers).
    - Partial truths (e.g., 'Only for critical' vs. 'severity-based').
    - Framework mix-ups (e.g., NIST CSF vs. ISO 27001).
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Management Escalation
  Paths'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response Team Organization
  > 001_Governance and Authority > Escalation Framework > Management Escalation Paths). Use the provided learning objectives
  (spanning REMEMBER to CREATE), active learning activities, 4-layer scaffolding (Foundation to Integration with completed
  NIST CSF 2.0 key takeaways: GV.OC-05 for escalation thresholds; sources: NIST SP 800-61r3, CSF 2.0, SANS), and flashcard
  schema.


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet: Cover all Bloom''s levels proportionally (more higher-order),
  integrate real-world examples (ransomware), textual flowcharts, concept maps. Strictly follow schema: Front (varied Q types),
  Back (answer + explanation + level + source + active link). For MCQs, use distractor protocol.


  Incorporate voter priorities: Precise verbs, examples, completeness (full NIST details), scaffolding. Output as JSON array:
  [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''blooms_level'': ''...'', ''source'': ''...'',
  ''active_learning_link'': ''...''}}, ...]. Ensure active learning (e.g., scenario-based) and university pedagogy (scaffolded,
  measurable).'
