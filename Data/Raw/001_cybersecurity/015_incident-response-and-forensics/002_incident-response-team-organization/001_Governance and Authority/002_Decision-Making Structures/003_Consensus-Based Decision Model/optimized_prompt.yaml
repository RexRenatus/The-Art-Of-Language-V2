  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of using a consensus-based decision model versus a hierarchical
    model during a live ransomware incident. Consider factors like decision speed, buy-in, and error reduction. Support your
    arguments with references to NIST SP 800-61 and real-world IR outcomes.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Incident Response. Topic:
  Consensus-Based Decision Model (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response Team
  Organization > 001_Governance and Authority > Decision-Making Structures > Consensus-Based Decision Model). Consensus reached

  Use this research context: [Insert full research from provided: Core concepts (consensus, stakeholders), NIST CSF 2.0 Govern
  (stakeholder engagement), NIST SP 800-61 Rev 2/3 (team coordination for IR lifecycle: prepare, detect, analyze, contain,
  eradicate, recover, lessons). Pros: Shared ownership, diverse input. Cons: Time-intensive. Improves outcomes: Faster recovery,
  lower risks. Sources: NIST SP 800-61r2 (link), CSF 2.0 (link), SANS IR resources.]
