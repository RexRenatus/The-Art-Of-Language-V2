        {
          "text": "It mandates that incident response reporting be a completely separate function from risk management.",

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "NIST CSF 2.0 promotes integrating IR reporting into risk management because this holistic approach ensures that potential incidents are considered during risk assessments and that response capabilities are aligned with overall organizational risk tolerance, thereby improving resilience.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors propose strict separation, technical-only focus, or reactive reporting, all of which contradict CSF 2.0's emphasis on integrated, proactive risk management that includes incident response reporting.",
        "analogy": "CSF 2.0 treats incident reporting like a 'check engine' light in a car; it's not just a warning, but information that feeds into the overall maintenance and driving strategy (risk management) to prevent bigger problems."
