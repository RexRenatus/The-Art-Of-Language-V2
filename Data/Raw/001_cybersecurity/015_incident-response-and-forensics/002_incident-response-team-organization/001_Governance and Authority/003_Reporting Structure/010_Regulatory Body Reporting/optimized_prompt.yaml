active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether standardized reporting templates (e.g., NIST-guided or CISA forms) reduce
    or increase organizational burden during incidents, using real-world cases like the Equifax breach or SolarWinds supply
    chain attack. Support with evidence on timelines and compliance outcomes.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    ''No reporting if contained internally''). Base on voter-noted misconceptions, real-world errors (Equifax delays), or
    regulatory nuances. Ensure distractors are realistic to challenge at Bloom''s ANALYZE/EVALUATE levels.'

  **Research Context (Complete/Expanded):** Regulatory body reporting mandates disclosure of incidents to authorities (e.g.,
  CISA, SEC, HHS). NIST SP 800-61 Rev 3 (April 2025) integrates IR into CSF 2.0 for risk management: prepare (policies), detect/respond
  (classify/report), recover. Key regs: GDPR Art 33 (72h to authority if risk), Art 34 (users); HIPAA Breach Notification
  (60 days to individuals, 60 to HHS if 500+); SEC Reg S-K Item 1.05 (4 biz days for material incidents); CCPA/CPRA (45-90
  days); CISA for critical infra. Examples: Equifax (delayed SEC), SolarWinds (CISA voluntary). Roles: CSIRT coordinator.
