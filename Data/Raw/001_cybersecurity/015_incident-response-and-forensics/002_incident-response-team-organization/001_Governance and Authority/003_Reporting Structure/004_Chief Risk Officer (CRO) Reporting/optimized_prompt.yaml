active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the effectiveness of direct CRO reporting to the Board versus routing through
    the CEO during a major cyber incident. Use NIST SP 800-61 escalation guidelines and real-world examples (e.g., post-breach
    reporting in Equifax or SolarWinds) to support arguments, evaluating risks to governance and compliance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (CRO focuses on enterprise risk, not ops), misstate reporting lines (e.g., CRO reports to IT instead of Board), use outdated
    NIST versions, or swap KPIs (e.g., MTTR vs. MTTD). Base on common misconceptions from voter priorities like incomplete
    governance or CISO overlap.'
