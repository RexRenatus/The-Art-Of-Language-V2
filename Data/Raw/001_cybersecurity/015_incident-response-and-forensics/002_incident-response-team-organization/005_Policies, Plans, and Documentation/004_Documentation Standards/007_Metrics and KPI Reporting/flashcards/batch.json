        "core_logic": "NIST SP 800-55 Vol. 2 offers a framework for building measurement programs, which is directly applicable to incident response. It guides organizations on how to select, develop, and implement relevant metrics (including KPIs) in a structured way, ensuring they are aligned with security goals and provide meaningful insights.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The first distractor wrongly claims mandates. The second incorrectly limits the scope to technical controls. The third incorrectly dismisses its relevance.",
        "analogy": "SP 800-55 Vol. 2 is like a cookbook for creating measurement dishes; it provides techniques and principles for making effective metrics, rather than a fixed menu of specific KPIs."
