        "core_logic": "The key difference is their objective: containment aims to stop the bleeding, while eradication aims to kill the infection, because they function by different mechanisms. Containment limits spread, often by isolating affected segments, whereas eradication removes the root cause of the incident, such as malware or unauthorized access.",
        "distractor_analysis": "While isolation and patching are tactics, they represent the goals of containment and eradication respectively. Both are reactive responses to an active incident. Data recovery is part of the recovery phase.",
        "analogy": "Containment is like putting a patient in quarantine to prevent a disease from spreading. Eradication is like administering medicine to kill the disease itself."
