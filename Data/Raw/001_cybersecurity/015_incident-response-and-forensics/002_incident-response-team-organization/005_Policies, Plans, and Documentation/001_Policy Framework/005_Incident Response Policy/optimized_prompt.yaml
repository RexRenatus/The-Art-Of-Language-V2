  discussion_prompt: 'In groups, debate the statement: ''A generic Incident Response Policy is sufficient for both IT and
    OT environments.'' Use NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 phases and OT-specific risks (e.g., physical impacts) to support your arguments,
    referencing the CIA Triad violations.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truth (e.g., list 5/6 phases); 3) Plausible alternative (e.g., non-NIST phase like ''Investigation''). Ensure
    distractors are realistic, sourced from voter-noted gaps or OT/IT differences.'

  Team Organization > 004_Policies, Plans, and Documentation > Policy Framework > 002_Incident Response Policy). Voter consensus:
  100% approval on completeness (full NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 phases), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression), scaffolding (4 layers),
  engagement (active learning), concept map.


  Incorporate research: Core concepts (IRP, IRT, Incident, Forensics, OT); NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 full phases (Preparation,
  Detection&Analysis, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Post-Incident); Sources (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf).


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (balanced across 4 scaffolding layers, all 6 Bloom''s levels, 70% MCQ/30% short answer).
  Use exact schema: {''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''correct_answer'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [...], ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''1-4'', ''bloom_level'': ''...''}, ''concept_map_link'': ''...''}. Ensure active learning
  tie-ins (e.g., scenario-based Qs for problem-solving).


  Textual Concept Map: Central ''Incident Response Policy'' → IRP, IRT, NIST Phases (6), CIA Triad, Forensics, OT/CSF 2.0.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 50 flashcards.'
