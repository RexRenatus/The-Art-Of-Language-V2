active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of a widespread DDoS attack, debate whether organizations should share full IoCs publicly
    or only with trusted ISACs, considering legal (e.g., antitrust laws), ethical (e.g., privacy), and operational (e.g.,
    tipping off attackers) trade-offs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Core content from NIST/web research: Cyber threat info (IoCs, TTPs); NIST SP 800-150 (goals, partners, agreements); SP 800-61
  Rev. 3 (IR phases, CSF 2.0 profile); CSF 2.0 Govern (OV.G-01 oversight); tools like STIX/TAXII; ISACs. Sources: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/150/final,

  Generate 40 high-quality flashcards (10 per scaffolding layer) covering all Bloom''s levels proportionally. Balance: 30%
  REM/UND, 40% APP/ANA, 30% EVA/CRE. Use flashcard_schema exactly: Front (Q), Back (answer, explanation, reference, bloom_level,
  scaffolding_layer). Ensure completeness (e.g., full CSF 2.0 Govern integration). Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'':
  ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''reference'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'':
  ''...''}}]. Make questions active/recall-oriented for spaced repetition.'
