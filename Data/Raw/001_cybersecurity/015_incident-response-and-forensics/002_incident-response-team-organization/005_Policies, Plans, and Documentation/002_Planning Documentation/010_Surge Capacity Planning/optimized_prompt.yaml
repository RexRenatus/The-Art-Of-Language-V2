active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the effectiveness of surge capacity planning in OT versus IT environments using NIST SP 800-61
    examples. Consider challenges like legacy systems in OT and misconceptions that IT plans suffice for OT—provide evidence
    from frameworks and propose hybrid solutions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Distractor 1: Semantic trap (similar term misused, e.g., ''surge capacity'' confused with ''backup capacity'').'
    - 'Distractor 2: Partial credit (correct for basic but misses surge context, e.g., standard IRT roles without scaling).'
    - 'Distractor 3: Extreme/edge case (overly simplistic or ignores OT challenges).'
    - 'Ensure balance: Distractors plausible for learners at prior knowledge level (IR phases, IRT org).'
    - Avoid 'all/none of the above'; make each viable.

  **Contextual Knowledge (Web-Grounded Research, Completed per Consensus):**

  Surge capacity: Scaling resources for incident spikes. Integrates NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 (Preparation: IRT policies, roles,
  training, exercises; Detection/Analysis/Containment/Recovery/Post-Incident). Strategies: Staffing aug, vendors, cross-training.
  OT challenges: Legacy systems. NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 (2025 draft): CSF 2.0 IR profile. Sources: NIST SP 800-61r2 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf),
  CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), SANS IR (https://www.sans.org/white-papers/).
