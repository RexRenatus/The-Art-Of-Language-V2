        "core_logic": "A Business Impact Analysis (BIA) quantifies the potential impact of disruptions on critical business functions and establishes recovery priorities (RTOs/RPOs). Since these dictate the required speed and scope of response and recovery, the BIA directly informs the necessary resource allocation and thus the IR budget.",
