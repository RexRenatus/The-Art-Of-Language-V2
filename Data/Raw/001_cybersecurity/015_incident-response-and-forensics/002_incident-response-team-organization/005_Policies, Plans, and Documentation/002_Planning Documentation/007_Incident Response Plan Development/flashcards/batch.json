        "core_logic": "Encouraging feedback on draft publications is important because it allows NIST to gather diverse insights and practical experiences, leading to more comprehensive, accurate, and widely applicable guidance.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly suggest the goal is organizational control over standards, reducing author workload, or mere compliance, missing the core benefit of improving the guidance's quality and relevance through collective input.",
        "analogy": "Encouraging feedback on draft publications is like having beta testers for software; their input helps identify bugs and improve usability before the final release."
