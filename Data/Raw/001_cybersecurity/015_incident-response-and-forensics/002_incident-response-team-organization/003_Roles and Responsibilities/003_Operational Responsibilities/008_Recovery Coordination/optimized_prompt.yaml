active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a real-world cyber incident like a ransomware attack, debate the trade-offs between rapid recovery
    (prioritizing RTO) versus thorough validation to prevent re-infection (prioritizing resilience). Use NIST SP 800-184 to
    support arguments and address common misconceptions about speed versus security.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse RTO with RPO), 2) Similar term (e.g., Business
      Continuity instead of Recovery Coordination), 3) Extreme/opposite (e.g., ''ignore testing for speed'').'
    - Ensure distractors are plausible based on research context or voter-noted misconceptions (e.g., speed vs. security).
    - Distractors must be incorrect but educationally valuable for reinforcing understanding.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Incident Response. Topic:
  005_Recovery Coordination (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response Team Organization
  > 003_Roles and Responsibilities > Operational Responsibilities > 005_Recovery Coordination). Use this comprehensive content:


  Core Concepts: Recovery coordination is the post-incident phase restoring systems/services/data, minimizing impact, ensuring
  continuity, preventing recurrence. Key aspects: restoration, resilience, BC, DR. Metrics: RTO (time to recover), RPO (data
  loss tolerance).

  Frameworks: NIST CSF 2.0 (recovery in risk mgmt), NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 (IR recommendations), SP 800-184 (event recovery),
  Rev. 2 (incident handling).

  Best Practices: Integrate with risk mgmt; communication protocols; post-recovery review/lessons learned.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert array from above]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert scaffolding from above]

  - Active Learning: Ensure flashcards support discussion/activities (e.g., trade-offs, scenarios).


  Generate 25-30 flashcards following the exact schema:

  {type: ''Q&A'' or ''MCQ'', question: ''...'', [for Q&A: answer], [for MCQ: correct_answer, distractors: [''d1'',''d2'',''d3'']],
  explanation: ''...'', blooms_level: ''REMEMBER|etc'', references: ''NIST SP 800-61 etc'', scaffolding_layer: ''1|2|3|4''}.


  Distractors: Follow protocol - plausible, educational. Balance: Cover all objectives/layers. Voter consensus: 82.9% approval,
  emphasize completeness (risk mgmt, reviews), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression). Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects.'
