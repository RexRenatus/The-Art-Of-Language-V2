  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the critical importance of the Deputy Manager role during prolonged incidents
    (e.g., a hospital ransomware attack). How does their coordination across NIST Respond categories (RS.MA, RS.AN, RS.CO,
    RS.MI) prevent escalation? Share real-world examples or non-examples of poor Deputy Manager performance and justify with
    evidence from standards like NIST CSF.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse Deputy with Analyst
    duties), 2) Partial truth/overlaps (e.g., Manager responsibility), 3) Non-example/pitfall (e.g., ignoring NIST RS.CO).
    Ensure distractors test subtle distinctions; reference voter pitfalls like poor coordination.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Incident Response Team
  roles. Topic: ''Deputy Manager'' (Hierarchy: Level 1 Cybersecurity > Level 2 002_Incident Response And Forensics > Level
  3 002_Incident Response Team Organization > Level 4 003_Roles and Responsibilities > Level 5 Core Team Roles > Level 6 Deputy
  Manager). Use this research context: Deputy Manager assists IR Manager, leads in absence, coordinates tasks (NIST RS.MA
  Mitigation/triage, RS.AN Analysis, RS.CO Communications, RS.MI Mitigation), ensures plan adherence, mentors staff, contributes
  to lessons learned (RS.IM Improvements); frameworks: NIST CSF 2.0 Respond (full: RS.RP planning, RS.CO comms, RS.AN analysis,
  RS.MI mitigation, RS.IM improvements), SANS IR, ISO 27001; core concepts: incident, IR process, forensics, IRT, cyber resilience.


  Incorporate pedagogy: Learning objectives [insert array above]; Active learning [discussion/peer/problem-solving for engagement];
  Scaffolding [4 layers above, ensure coverage].


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards per schema: Balance Bloom''s (Remember 15%, Understand 20%, Apply 20%, Analyze 15%,
  Evaluate 15%, Create 15%); layers (Layer 1: 25%, 2: 25%, 3: 25%, 4: 25%). For MCQ: 1 correct + 3 distractors (plausible
  misconceptions/pitfalls). Every back includes explanation tying to objectives/scaffolding/NIST/voter suggestions (e.g.,
  escalations, ransomware scenarios).
