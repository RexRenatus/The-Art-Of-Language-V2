  - Active Learning: [PASTE FULL active_learning_components ARRAY HERE] (inspire scenario cards)

  - Scaffolding Layers: [PASTE FULL scaffolding_layers ARRAY HERE] (5 cards per layer)

  - Research Context: Base on NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 ''Computer Security Incident Handling Guide'' (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-61r2.pdf):
  IR lifecycle (Preparation, Detection/Analysis, Containment/Eradication/Recovery, Post-Incident); Security Analyst responsibilities
  (monitoring/triage/analysis in Detection phase, part of core IR team with roles like coordinator, forensics experts); tools
  (SIEM, IDS); metrics (MTTD/MTTR). Security Analyst: monitors threats, triages alerts, initial analysis, escalates; distinguishes
  from Forensic Analyst (deep investigation).


  Follow this exact schema for output: JSON array of 24 flashcards (6 per scaffolding layer, balanced Bloom''s). Each: {"id":
  1-24, "type": "Basic Q&A|MCQ|Scenario", "front": "...", "back": "...", "bloom_level": "Remember|Understand|Apply|Analyze|Evaluate|Create",
  "scaffolding_layer": 1-4, "explanation": "1-2 sentences with NIST ref or rationale, why distractors wrong if MCQ", "tags":
  ["SecurityAnalyst", "NIST800-61", "IRTeam"]}. Ensure active recall, no hints on front. Distractors per protocol. Cover misconceptions
  (e.g., analysts do full forensics). Make explanations pedagogical for self-testing.'
