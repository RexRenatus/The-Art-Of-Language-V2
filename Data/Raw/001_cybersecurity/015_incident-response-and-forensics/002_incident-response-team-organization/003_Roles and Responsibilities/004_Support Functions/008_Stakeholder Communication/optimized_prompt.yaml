    communications during an active ransomware incident. Support arguments with references to NIST, FIRST, or NCSC guidelines
    and real-world examples like the SolarWinds breach.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Incident Response. Topic:
  ''Stakeholder Communication'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response Team
  Organization > 003_Roles and Responsibilities > Support Functions > Stakeholder Communication). Use this research context:
  Effective stakeholder comms in IR builds trust; stakeholders (internal/external); frameworks (NIST SP 800-61/CSF for plans/contact
  lists, FIRST for coordination, NCSC for reporting/media); best practices (pre-defined plans, spokespersons, templates, escalation,
  training, logging, debriefs).


  Incorporate: Learning objectives [paste array above]; Active learning [paste activities]; Scaffolding [paste layers]; Prior
  knowledge (IR lifecycle, CSIRT roles).


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards following the exact schema: Front (question with Bloom tag), Back (answer/explanation/distractors/metadata).
  Cover all Bloom levels/objectives proportionally, all scaffolding layers, voter priorities (completeness on best practices,
  pedagogy via Bloom/scaffolding, concept map). Ensure web-grounded (cite NIST/FIRST/NCSC), university pedagogy (active recall,
  distractors for critical thinking). Output as numbered list in markdown format, optimized for Anki/Quizlet import.'
