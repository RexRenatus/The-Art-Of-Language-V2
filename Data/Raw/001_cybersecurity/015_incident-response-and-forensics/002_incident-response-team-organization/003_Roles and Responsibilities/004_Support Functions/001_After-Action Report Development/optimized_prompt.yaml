  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the potential consequences of skipping an AAR after a major ransomware
    incident. How does it impact the incident response lifecycle and team roles? Reference NIST SP 800-61 and provide real-world
    examples to support your arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Research Context: After-Action Reports (AARs) analyze cybersecurity incidents/exercises per NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 (Post-Incident
  Activity: lessons learned meetings/reports). Standard structure: Event overview, timeline, planned vs. actual, strengths/weaknesses,
  lessons learned, recommendations/action items. Links to NIST CSF 2.0 (Improve function). Best practices: Involve IR team
  roles; IT/OT considerations. Sources: NIST SP 800-61r2 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf),
  NIST CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), FEMA AAR templates.


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding: Generate 8-12 flashcards distributed across 4 layers (2-3 per layer), progressing from Foundation to Integration.

  - Ensure coverage: 30% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 40% APPLY/ANALYZE, 30% EVALUATE/CREATE.


  Flashcard Generation Rules:

  - Generate 10 high-quality flashcards (mix: 40% basic Q/A or cloze, 60% MCQ).

  - Strictly follow schema: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD_SCHEMA FROM ABOVE].

  - Questions must be optimized for Anki/Spaced Repetition: Active recall, no cues.

  - Distractors: Exactly 3 per MCQ, plausible, with explanations.

  - Tie each card to objectives, layers, and active learning (e.g., ''Use in peer teaching'').

  - Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''id'':1, ''front'':''...'', ''back'':{...}}, ...]. No extra text.'
