active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue the pros and cons of involving legal counsel from the Preparation phase versus
    only during Analysis/Containment in a major data breach. Use examples from NIST SP 800-61 and real breaches like Equifax
    to support your position. What risks arise if legal input is delayed?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Similar concepts (e.g., chain of custody vs. data backup).
    - Phase mix-ups (e.g., notifications in Preparation vs. Recovery).
    - Real-world errors (e.g., Equifax delay as 'best practice').

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Incident Response. Topic:
  Legal Counsel (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response Team Organization
  > 003_Roles and Responsibilities > Extended Team Roles > Legal Counsel). Use this comprehensive context:


  **Research Context (Completed):** Legal Counsel advises on compliance, notifications (GDPR/HIPAA/Canada PIPEDA), chain of
  custody, evidence preservation in IR/forensics. Per NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/61/r3/final):
  Integrate legal in all phases. NIST CSF 2.0: Risk management includes legal. Sedona Canada Principles (https://sedonaconference.org/principles):
  Proportionality in e-discovery, preserve metadata, minimize intrusiveness for Canadian courts. Examples: Equifax (2017,
  fines for poor disclosure); SolarWinds (2020, legal in supply chain reporting). Sources: NIST SP 800-61r3; SANS IR Playbooks
  (https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/incident/); Sedona Canada 3.0 (https://www.sedonaconference.org/the-sedona-conference-canada-principles-addressing-electronic-discovery).

  Generate 25 flashcards following the exact schema: Front (question), Back (answer, explanation, bloom_level, source, distractors
  if MC). Balance: 30% Layer1-2 (Remember/Understand), 40% Layer3 (Apply/Analyze), 30% Layer4 (Evaluate/Create). Vary formats.
  Ensure voter priorities: phase coverage, examples, prior links (e.g., NIST phases). Output as JSON array of objects.'
