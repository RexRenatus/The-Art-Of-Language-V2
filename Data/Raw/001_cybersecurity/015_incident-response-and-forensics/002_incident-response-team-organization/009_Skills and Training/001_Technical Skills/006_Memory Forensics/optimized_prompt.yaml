active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given a live incident where power might be cut to the suspect machine at any moment, debate the trade-offs
    between rapid memory acquisition (e.g., using DumpIt) versus comprehensive disk imaging. What factors (e.g., volatility
    of evidence, legal considerations, system stability) influence your prioritization? Support with references to NIST SP
    800-86.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''disk forensics''
    for memory), 2) Similar terms/tools (e.g., ''Rekall'' vs. ''Volatility'' swapped), 3) Partial truths (e.g., ''alters disk''
    instead of memory), 4) Voter/research pitfalls (e.g., ignoring live risks). Ensure distractors test deeper understanding.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in memory forensics. Use the
  following to create high-quality, pedagogically optimized flashcards for topic ''007_Memory Forensics'' (Category: Cybersecurity,
  Domain: 002_Incident Response And Forensics, Subdomain: 002_Incident Response Team Organization / Entry: 009_Skills and
  Training > Technical Skills).


  **Core Content Sources:** Integrate voter priorities (e.g., tools like Volatility/Rekall/DumpIt/FTK Imager/LiME, techniques
  like pslist/netscan, risks), research (NIST SP 800-86, SANS, SWGDE), and provided scaffolding layers.


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s Taxonomy):** [Insert the 6 objectives array here]. Ensure cards map to these.


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers here]. Distribute cards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4.


  **Active Learning Ties:** Weave in references to discussion (trade-offs), peer teaching (analogies), problem-solving (Volatility
  on dumps).


  **Flashcard Generation Rules:**

  - Generate 75 flashcards in JSON array: [{''type'': ''Q&A|MCQ|Cloze'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''blooms_level'':
  ''Remember|Understand|Apply|Analyze|Evaluate|Create'', ''layer'': ''1|2|3|4'', ''explanation'': ''...''}].

  - Follow exact schema: [Insert flashcard_schema here].

  - Balance: Prioritize higher Bloom''s for advanced cards.

  - Plausibility: Ground in real tools/processes; avoid fabrication.

  - Output only the JSON array of flashcards.'
