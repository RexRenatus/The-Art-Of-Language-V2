active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how unmanaged stress during a live ransomware incident could cascade into
    errors (e.g., overlooked evidence in forensics), and propose 2-3 team-level interventions drawing from NIST frameworks
    or first-responder psychology studies. Justify using real-world IR examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in non-technical skills like\
  \ Stress Management in Incident Response Team Organization (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics\
  \ > 002_Incident Response Team Organization > 009_Skills and Training > Non-Technical Skills > Stress Management). Consensus-approved\
  \ (100%) with voter priorities on Bloom's Taxonomy, 4-layer scaffolding, IR-specific techniques (mindfulness, peer support,\
  \ debriefs), NIST SP 800-61 integration, SANS resources, and first-responder psychology.\n\nGenerate 50 high-quality flashcards\
  \ (10 per Bloom's pair: Remember/Understand, Apply/Analyze, Evaluate/Create; balanced across 4 scaffolding layers). Optimize\
