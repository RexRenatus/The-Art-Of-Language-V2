  discussion_prompt: In a high-stakes Incident Response (IR) team, debate the top 3 priorities for onboarding new members
    (e.g., policy familiarization vs. hands-on tool training vs. team culture). Support arguments with NIST SP 800-61 Rev.
    2 lifecycle examples (Preparation phase emphasis) and real-world consequences of poor preparation, such as extended downtime
    in a ransomware attack. Groups present and vote on consensus priorities.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
