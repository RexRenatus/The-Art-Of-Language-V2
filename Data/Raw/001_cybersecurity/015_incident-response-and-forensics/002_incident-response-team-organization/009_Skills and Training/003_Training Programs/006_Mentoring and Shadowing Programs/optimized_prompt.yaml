  discussion_prompt: 'In small groups, debate the following: ''In high-stakes incident response environments, is structured
    mentoring more effective than informal shadowing for building forensics skills? Support your position with examples of
    technical (e.g., forensic tools) and soft skills (e.g., communication under pressure), and consider challenges like time
    constraints during active incidents.'' Encourage critical thinking by requiring groups to reference NICE Framework KSAs.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Shadowing involves independent task
      execution' vs. reality of observation; 'Mentoring focuses only on technical skills' ignoring soft skills; 'No need for
      evaluation metrics' vs. importance of KSAs alignment).
    - Ensure distractors are realistic (e.g., partial truths, opposites, unrelated but similar terms like 'internship vs.
      shadowing').
    - Avoid obvious wrongs; test for 'foil quality' – should challenge knowledgeable learners.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Incident Response and Forensics.
  Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards on ''Mentoring and Shadowing Programs'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident
  Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response Team Organization > 009_Skills and Training > Training Programs > Mentoring
  and Shadowing Programs). Use the provided learning_objectives, active_learning activities, scaffolding layers, and flashcard_schema
  EXACTLY.


  Context: These programs bridge the talent gap via mentorship (guidance from experts) and shadowing (observational training).
  Focus on technical skills (forensic tools, incident handling), soft skills (communication), best practices (matching, feedback,
  evaluation), and alignment with NICE Framework KSAs/CISA. Sources: NICE Framework (nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice),
  CISA workforce resources.


  Incorporate pedagogy: Bloom''s progression, active learning hooks (e.g., reference discussion scenarios in explanations),
  4-layer scaffolding.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"id": 1, "type": "mcq/basic/cloze", "front": "...", "back": "...", "bloom_level":
  "...", "scaffolding_layer": 1-4, "explanation_tags": ["NICE", "best_practice"]}. Ensure 10 per scaffolding layer, balanced
  types, rigorous distractors per protocol. Cards must be concise (under 200 words), optimized for spaced repetition (Anki-compatible).'
