        "core_logic": "NIST CSF 2.0 is significant because it promotes a holistic approach, integrating incident response into the broader cybersecurity risk management strategy. It works by providing a framework of functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) and categories that guide organizations in managing cyber risks, including preparedness and response.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly define CSF 2.0 as a purely technical guide, a mandate for specific tools, or solely focused on forensics, missing its strategic, risk-management-oriented approach to cybersecurity, including IR.",
        "analogy": "NIST CSF 2.0 is like a company's overall business strategy document that includes how to handle unexpected market disruptions (incidents), rather than just a detailed operational manual for one department."
