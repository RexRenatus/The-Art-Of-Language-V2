        {
          "text": "SSDs are inherently encrypted, making acquisition impossible without keys; EnCase can bypass this encryption.",

        "core_logic": "SSDs employ internal algorithms like wear-leveling and garbage collection that can move data blocks, making traditional bit-for-bit imaging challenging as data may be relocated or zeroed out. Forensic tools like EnCase, combined with appropriate hardware write-blockers and acquisition methods, aim to capture data before these internal processes alter it, preserving evidence integrity.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors present several inaccuracies: claiming SSDs are always encrypted, misstating their capacity, and incorrectly stating EnCase lacks specialized driver support for them. The correct answer highlights the core technical challenge of SSDs and the need for specialized forensic approaches.",
        "analogy": "Acquiring data from an SSD is like trying to photograph a constantly rearranging stage set; you need precise timing and techniques to capture the scene before the actors move."
