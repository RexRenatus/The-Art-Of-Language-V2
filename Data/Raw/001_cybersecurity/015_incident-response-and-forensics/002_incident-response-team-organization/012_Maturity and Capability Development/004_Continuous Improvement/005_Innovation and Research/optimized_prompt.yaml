active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of allocating 10-20% of an IR team's budget to research
    and innovation (e.g., AI/ML tools vs. traditional forensics). Use NIST CSF 2.0 to support arguments and propose metrics
    for success.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    Partial truth (e.g., outdated framework version), 3) Extreme/unrealistic (e.g., ''No research needed in IR''). Ensure
    distractors are plausible based on voter suggestions and web context.'

  Incorporate this research context: NIST CSF 2.0 and SP 800-61 Rev. 3 emphasize R&D integration for IR efficiency; innovations
  include AI/ML forensics, threat hunting research, threat intelligence; sources: NIST docs, Bitsight.com/blog/7-cybersecurity
  (expand on emerging tools/case studies).


  Use these LEARNING OBJECTIVES (Bloom''s structured): [insert array above].


  ACTIVE LEARNING for context: [insert active_learning above] – inspire cards that prompt similar thinking.


  SCAFFOLDING LAYERS: Generate 10-15 flashcards per layer using content below: [insert scaffolding above]. Progress from foundation
  to integration.


  FLASHCARD SCHEMA: Output JSON array of 50 flashcards (balanced across layers/Bloom''s). Each: {''front'': str, ''back'':
  {''answer'': str, ''explanation'': str, ''distractors'': [str,str,str], ''source'': str, ''layer'': int, ''bloom_level'':
  str}}. Use MCQ for analyze/evaluate, cloze/short answer for remember/understand. Follow distractor protocol exactly.


  Ensure university pedagogy: Active recall, spaced repetition friendly, tied to voter priorities (e.g., AI examples, metrics).
  High-quality, no fluff.'
