active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a major ransomware incident affecting a healthcare provider, prioritize and debate the top 5 constituencies
    to engage first. Justify why internal (e.g., executives) vs. external (e.g., regulators) stakeholders should lead communications,
    considering trust-building and regulatory compliance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Taxonomy, active learning, and scaffolding. Topic: Constituency Growth Management (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident
  Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response Team Organization > 012_Maturity and Capability Development > Organizational
  Evolution > Constituency Growth Management). Builds on NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 (Incident Handling Guide, CSF 2.0 profile),
  stakeholder management.


  Core content: Constituency = stakeholders (internal: execs/SOC/HR; external: regulators/partners/public) affected by incidents.
  Growth management = proactive scaling relationships for effective IR via mapping, protocols, metrics.

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list from above].

  - Scaffolding: [insert full 4 layers from above].

  - Active Learning: [insert discussion/peer/problem-solving from above] – reference in explanations.

  - Prerequisites: IR basics (NIST phases), team roles.

  - Big Picture: Evolves org from reactive to mature/proactive IR.
