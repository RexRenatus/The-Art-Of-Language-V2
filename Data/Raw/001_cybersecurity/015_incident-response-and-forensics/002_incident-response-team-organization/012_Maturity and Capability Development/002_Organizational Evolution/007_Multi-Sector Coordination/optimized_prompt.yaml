active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges (e.g., trust issues, legal constraints) and benefits (e.g.,
    faster threat intelligence) of multi-sector coordination during a real-world incident like the SolarWinds supply chain
    attack. Reference NIST SP 800-61 and CISA guidelines to support arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    intra-org only), (2) Outdated/irrelevant practice (e.g., pre-NIST Rev. 3), (3) Partial truth (e.g., valid for single-sector
    but not multi). Ensure distractors test deeper understanding.'

  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active learning ties: Link explanations to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving where relevant.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards: 6 Layer 1, 7 Layer 2, 7 Layer 3, 5 Layer 4. Use provided layer content.

  - Sources: NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf), Rev. 3 (2025,
  CSF 2.0 aligned), CISA multi-sector resources (https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/information-sharing),
  FS-ISAC (https://www.fsisac.com/), STIX/TAXII standards.

  - Voter priorities: Emphasize completeness (roles, MOUs, RACI, escalation, governance, legal), prior knowledge (NIST phases,
  single-org teams).


  Follow exact flashcard schema: [PASTE FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Output as JSON array of objects, each with ''front'' and
  ''back'' (nested object). Ensure distractors per protocol. Cards must scaffold from foundation to integration, span Bloom''s
  levels, and enable active learning (e.g., ''How would you apply this in a peer discussion?''). No duplicates; optimize for
  spaced repetition and retention.'
