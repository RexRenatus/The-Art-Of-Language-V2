active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of prioritizing MTTC reduction (e.g., aggressive containment
    vs. thorough analysis). Use real-world examples from Verizon DBIR reports to support arguments on how low MTTC contributes
    to IR maturity and cost savings.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Topic Hierarchy:** Cybersecurity (L1) → 002_Incident Response And Forensics (L2) → 002_Incident Response Team Organization
  (L3) → 011_Metrics and Performance Management (L4) → Operational Metrics (L5) → MTTC (L6).


  **Prior Knowledge/Big Picture:** Builds on IR lifecycle (NIST SP 800-61: Detect, Respond); Related: MTTD, MTTR. Role: KPI
  for IR efficiency, compliance (CSF 2.0), cost reduction (Verizon DBIR).


  **Concept Map:** Central: MTTC → Detection Time, Containment Actions, Influencers (IRP, Training), Outcomes (Lower Risk),
  Related (MTTD/MTTR).


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s):** REMEMBER: Define MTTC... [insert full list from above].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [insert full scaffolding from above, including prior_knowledge and layers].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Flashcards should prompt recall/application mimicking discussion (e.g., ''Debate: Trade-offs
  of low MTTC?''), peer teaching (calculation sharing), problem-solving (scenarios).


  **Flashcard Generation Rules:**

  - Output JSON array of flashcards.

  - Follow schema: {type, front, back, bloom_level, layer, explanation, tags}.

  - Distractors: As per protocol.

  - Ensure progressive difficulty: 30% Layer1, 25% L2, 20% L3, 25% L4.

  - Sources in explanations: NIST SP 800-61r3, Verizon DBIR.

  - Best Practices: Playbooks for malware/ransomware, automation, drills.
