active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of report timeliness versus accuracy in incident response, referencing NIST SP
    800-61r3. Consider factors influencing optimal timing for stakeholders (e.g., executives needing high-level summaries
    quickly vs. legal teams requiring detailed forensics). What escalation principles from NISTIR 8428 (timely reporting and
    escalation) should guide decisions?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate plausible distractors based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''timeliness overrides accuracy'').
    2) Partial truths (e.g., correct timeline but wrong stakeholder). 3) Confusions with related concepts (e.g., MTTR vs.
    report timeliness). 4) Real-world extremes (e.g., ''always immediate'' vs. NIST nuanced). Ensure distractors are realistic
    for cybersecurity pros.'
