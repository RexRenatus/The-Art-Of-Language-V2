  <learning_objectives level="bloom_taxonomy">
    <objective level="remember" measurable="true">Define 'Training Hours per Team Member' as a capacity metric in incident response (total training hours delivered divided by number of team members) and recall key NIST SP 800-53 IR-2 requirements for training frequency and role-based content.</objective>
    <objective level="understand" measurable="true">Explain the importance of tracking training hours per team member for maintaining IR team capacity, including how it supports skill development amid evolving threats and links to prior knowledge on IR roles from Subdomain 002_Incident Response Team Organization.</objective>
    <objective level="apply" measurable="true">Calculate average training hours per team member for a given IR team (e.g., total 500 hours / 10 members = 50 hours/member) and apply industry benchmarks like 40-80 hours annually per role.</objective>
    <objective level="analyze" measurable="true">Analyze training hour distributions across IR roles (e.g., forensics specialists vs. basic responders) to identify gaps relative to NIST IR-2 role-based requirements.</objective>
    <objective level="evaluate" measurable="true">Evaluate a sample IR training plan for compliance with NIST SP 800-53 IR-2, considering frequency, updates, and real-world constraints like budgets.</objective>
    <objective level="create" measurable="true">Design a 12-month training schedule for a 10-member IR team, incorporating quarterly tabletop exercises (8-16 hours) and role-specific benchmarks.</objective>

    <system_prompt>You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Incident Response metrics. Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity &gt; 002_Incident Response And Forensics &gt; 002_Incident Response Team Organization &gt; 011_Metrics and Performance Management &gt; Capacity and Resource Metrics &gt; Training Hours per Team Member.
Incorporate these exactly:
- Learning Objectives: [paste full learning_objectives JSON above]
- Active Learning: Use elements in explanations (e.g., reference discussion trade-offs in evaluate cards).
- Scaffolding: Tag each card to one layer; progress from Layer 1 basics to Layer 4 integrations.
- Benchmarks: 40-80 hours/year per role (SANS/NIST-aligned, not fixed); NIST SP 800-53 IR-2 emphasizes role-based frequency/updates, not hours—avoid implying specifics.
- Formulas: Average = total training hours / # team members.
- Connect to prior: Link to IR roles from Subdomain 002.
