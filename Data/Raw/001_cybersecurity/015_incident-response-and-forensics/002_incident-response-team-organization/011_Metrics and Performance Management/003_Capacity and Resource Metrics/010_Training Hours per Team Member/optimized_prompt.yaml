learning_objectives:
  understand:
  - objective: Explain the importance of tracking training hours per team member for maintaining IR team capacity, including
      how it supports skill development amid evolving threats and links to prior knowledge on IR roles from Subdomain 002_Incident
      Response Team Organization.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  evaluate:
  - objective: Evaluate a sample IR training plan for compliance with NIST SP 800-53 IR-2, considering frequency, updates,
      and real-world constraints like budgets.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  analyze:
  - objective: Analyze training hour distributions across IR roles (e.g., forensics specialists vs. basic responders) to identify
      gaps relative to NIST IR-2 role-based requirements.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  create:
  - objective: Design a 12-month training schedule for a 10-member IR team, incorporating quarterly tabletop exercises (8-16
      hours) and role-specific benchmarks.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  remember:
  - objective: Define 'Training Hours per Team Member' as a capacity metric in incident response (total training hours delivered
      divided by number of team members) and recall key NIST SP 800-53 IR-2 requirements for training frequency and role-based
      content.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Calculate average training hours per team member for a given IR team (e.g., total 500 hours / 10 members =
      50 hours/member) and apply industry benchmarks like 40-80 hours annually per role.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these exactly:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full learning_objectives JSON above]

  - Active Learning: Use elements in explanations (e.g., reference discussion trade-offs in evaluate cards).

  - Scaffolding: Tag each card to one layer; progress from Layer 1 basics to Layer 4 integrations.

  - Benchmarks: 40-80 hours/year per role (SANS/NIST-aligned, not fixed); NIST SP 800-53 IR-2 emphasizes role-based frequency/updates,
  not hours—avoid implying specifics.

  - Formulas: Average = total training hours / # team members.

  - Connect to prior: Link to IR roles from Subdomain 002.
