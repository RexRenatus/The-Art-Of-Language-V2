active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a resource-constrained cybersecurity organization facing frequent incidents, debate whether prioritizing
    Recruitment Time reduction (e.g., via AI sourcing) compromises hire quality for Incident Response Teams. Reference NIST
    SP 800-61's emphasis on skilled team composition and provide evidence-based arguments for your position.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Confusable term (e.g., MTTR instead of Recruitment Time); 3) Extreme value/outlier (e.g., benchmark of 1 day vs. realistic
    60). Ensure plausibility from research/voter suggestions (e.g., ignore quality for speed).'

  Use this exact content for all cards:

  [Insert full scaffolding_layers content here, including definitions, NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2/3 details on IRT preparation/team
  staffing, concept map, sources]. Learning Objectives: [Insert learning_objectives array]. Active Learning Elements: Incorporate
  discussion/peer/problem-solving hooks in explanations where relevant.


  Generate 50 flashcards following this schema precisely:

  - Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''... (with Bloom tag)'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''... (pedagogical, 100-200w, links to objectives/layers/NIST)'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''opt1'',
  ''opt2'', ''opt3''] (MCQ only or []), ''related_concept'': ''...''}}]

  - Varied Q types per schema. Distractors per protocol. Scaffold progression: Cards 1-12 Layer1, 13-24 Layer2, etc. Ensure
  active recall, no hints on front. High pedagogy: Promote Bloom''s progression, voter consensus (completeness on NIST/sources,
  accuracy on metric def).'
