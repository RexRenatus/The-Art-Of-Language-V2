  discussion_prompt: In a resource-constrained organization, debate whether implementing an SNOC is preferable to maintaining
    separate NOC and SOC teams. Consider factors like alert fatigue, MTTR, team silos, cultural differences, and skill gaps.
    Support arguments with real-world examples from threat intelligence or forensic analysis.
  peer_teaching: 'Students pair up: Partner A explains NOC functions with examples/non-examples (e.g., bandwidth issue = NOC;
    malware infection = not NOC), Partner B explains SOC functions similarly, then switch. Pairs discuss SNOC integration
    benefits and how CSIRT/CERT/CIRT teams fit in, followed by whole-class share-out.'
  problem_solving: 'Present a real-world scenario: A DDoS attack causes network degradation and potential data exfiltration.
    In small groups, design an SNOC response plan applying unified monitoring, threat intelligence sharing, forensic analysis,
    and coordination with CSIRT/CERT/CIRT. Groups present plans and receive peer feedback on effectiveness.'

    threats''); 2) Partial truths (e.g., NOC benefit as SOC-only); 3) Voter-highlighted gaps (e.g., ignoring CSIRT integration);
    4) Research confusions (e.g., SOC as network uptime). Ensure distractors are realistic from siloed vs. integrated contexts.'

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full array above]

  - Active Learning: [reference activities for engagement hooks in explanations]

  - Scaffolding: Use 4 layers progressively—Layer 1 (foundation: definitions/prior knowledge), Layer 2 (components: functions/concept
  map), Layer 3 (implementation: steps/benefits/challenges/CSIRT integration), Layer 4 (integration: cases/optimizations).

  - Research: NOC=network health/uptime; SOC=threat detection/response/forensics; SNOC=unified model reducing silos, improving
  MTTD/MTTR; Integrate CSIRT (org IR), CERT (community), CIRT (IT incidents).


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards balanced across objectives (4-5 per Bloom''s level). Follow exact schema: JSON array
  of objects with ''type'' (60% MCQ, 20% Basic Q&A, 20% Cloze), ''front'', ''back'', ''options'' (MCQ only), ''explanation'',
  ''tags''. Ensure variety: 30% Layer1, 25% Layer2, 25% Layer3, 20% Layer4. Distractors per protocol. Make explanations educational,
  tying to pedagogy/voters/research. Output ONLY the JSON array.'
