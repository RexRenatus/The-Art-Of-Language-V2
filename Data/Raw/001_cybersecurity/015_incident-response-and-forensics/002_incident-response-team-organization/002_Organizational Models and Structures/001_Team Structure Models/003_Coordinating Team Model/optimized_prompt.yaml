  **Completed Research Context:** NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 (current standard, 2012; no official r3 yet, draft discussions align
  with CSF 2.0) defines CSIRT models. Coordinating Team Model: A CSIRT that serves as a central point of contact for multiple
  constituencies/teams, facilitating information sharing, policy guidance, and response de-confliction WITHOUT performing
  hands-on detection/analysis/containment. Key traits: Scalable for large/federated orgs; roles include coordinator, reporter,
  liaison. Pros: Enhances collaboration; Cons: Relies on team maturity. Vs. Centralized (one team handles all); Distributed
  (teams independent). Aligns with NIST CSF 2.0 Govern (oversight) and Respond (coordination across IR phases: Preparation,
  Detection, Analysis, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Lessons Learned). Sources: NIST SP 800-61r2 Appendix B, CSF 2.0
  (2024).


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Use these learning objectives [insert array above]. Incorporate active learning hooks [insert
  array above] as flashcard extensions (e.g., ''Discussion starter: ...''). Scaffold across 4 layers [insert array above]:
  Ensure flashcards progress from Layer 1 to 4.


  **Generation Rules:** Create 25 flashcards using schema [insert schema above]. Build on prior knowledge (IR phases). Distractors
  target misconceptions. Ensure university-level: Active recall, spaced repetition friendly. Output ONLY as numbered markdown
  list, e.g., ''1. **Multiple Choice** ...''. No intros.'
