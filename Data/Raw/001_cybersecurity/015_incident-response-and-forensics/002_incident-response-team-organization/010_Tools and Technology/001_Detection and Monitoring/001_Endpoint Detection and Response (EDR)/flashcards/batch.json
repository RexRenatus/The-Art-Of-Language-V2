        "core_logic": "EDR aids containment by allowing quick endpoint isolation because this action prevents the threat from spreading across the network, a critical step in limiting the damage from a security incident.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors describe actions from other IR phases (rebuilding, forensics) or unrealistic scenarios (negotiation), failing to identify EDR's specific role in rapid containment via isolation.",
        "analogy": "Containment via EDR is like quickly closing doors in a building to stop a fire from spreading to other rooms."
