  discussion_prompt: 'In groups, debate the evolution from Volatility 2 to 3: Argue pros/cons for incident response scenarios
    involving multi-OS environments (e.g., Windows/Linux). Consider factors like Automagic profile detection vs. manual symbol
    tables.'
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one explains Volatility 3 features (e.g., Automagic, plugins like pslist/dlllist/netscan) using
    a sample memory dump; the partner teaches back with a different plugin, addressing misconceptions like 'Memory forensics
    only for live systems.'
  problem_solving: 'Analyze a public memory dump (e.g., from Malware-Traffic-Analysis.net) to detect malware artifacts: Hypothesize
    root cause, timeline of compromise, and recommend containment steps. Think-pair-share findings.'
