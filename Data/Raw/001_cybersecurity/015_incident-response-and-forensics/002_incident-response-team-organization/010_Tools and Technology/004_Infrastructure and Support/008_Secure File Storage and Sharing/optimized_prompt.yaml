active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of incident response, debate the trade-offs between using cloud-based secure sharing services
    (e.g., compliant Azure or AWS S3 with encryption) versus on-premises solutions (e.g., SFTP servers) for handling CUI during
    a forensics investigation. Which NIST SP 800-171r3 controls (e.g., SC-8 Transmission Confidentiality) are most critical
    and why? Consider factors like cost, scalability, and compliance auditing.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    without encryption''); 2) Partial truths (e.g., ''NIST SP 800-53r5 only for federal''); 3) Confusions (e.g., mix CUI with
    classified info); 4) Voter-noted errors (e.g., ignoring nonfederal applicability). Ensure distractors teach by debunking.'
