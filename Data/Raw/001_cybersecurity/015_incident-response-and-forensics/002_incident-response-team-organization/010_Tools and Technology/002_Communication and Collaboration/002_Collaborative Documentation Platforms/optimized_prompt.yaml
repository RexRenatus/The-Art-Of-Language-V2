  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use for higher-order cards (e.g., scenarios from problem-solving).

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL LAYERS FROM ABOVE] – Distribute cards across layers (30% Layer 1-2, 40% Layer 3, 30%
  Layer 4).

  - Bloom''s Coverage: 20% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 50% Evaluate/Create.

  - Key Content: NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 (link: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf),
  CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework). Examples: Confluence, Notion, OneNote, GRR/Velociraptor. Features: real-time
