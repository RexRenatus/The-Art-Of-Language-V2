active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate whether end-to-end encryption (E2EE) is sufficient for securing incident response video conferences,
    or if additional measures like Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and waiting rooms
    are necessary. Use real-world examples like Zoom bombing incidents during high-profile events.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, explain the difference between 'attack surface' (all potential entry points) and 'vulnerabilities'
    (specific weaknesses) in video conferencing tools. Use analogies (e.g., attack surface as a castle's perimeter, vulnerabilities
    as unlocked doors), then switch roles for teach-back.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: During an IR team meeting on a live forensics investigation, a Meeting Bomber disrupts the call,
    potentially leaking sensitive data. In groups, develop a step-by-step mitigation plan (e.g., enable E2EE, lock meeting)
    and a post-incident forensic checklist to investigate the breach.'
