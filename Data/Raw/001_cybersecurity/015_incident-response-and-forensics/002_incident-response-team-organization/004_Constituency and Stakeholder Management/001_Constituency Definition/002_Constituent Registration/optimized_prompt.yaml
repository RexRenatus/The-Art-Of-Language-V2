  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains the differences between internal (e.g., employees, IT staff) and external
    (e.g., vendors, regulators) constituents with real-world examples; the partner then teaches back a complete constituent
    registration process, including a sample template.
  problem_solving: 'Given a phishing incident scenario affecting a mid-sized organization, groups of 3-4 students: (1) identify
    at least 10 constituents (internal/external), (2) create a registration template with prioritized communication fields,
    and (3) simulate registering them during a mock breach, then debrief on overlooked stakeholders.'

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy\
  \ (Bloom's Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 20 high-quality flashcards on 'Constituent Registration' (Topic\
  \ Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response Team Organization > 007_Constituency\
  \ and Stakeholder Management > Constituency Definition > Constituent Registration). Use the provided research context, voter\
  \ suggestions, and this optimized structure:\n\n**Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list above].\n**Active Learning Activities:**\
  \ [Insert full descriptions above] – inspire scenario-based cards.\n**Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full 4 layers above]\
  \ – generate 5 cards per layer.\n**Flashcard Schema:** Strictly follow [insert schema above], including MCQs with distractors,\
  \ explanations tied to Bloom's/objectives, and NIST references (SP 800-61 Rev. 2: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf;\
  \ Rev. 3 Draft: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/61/r3/draft).\n\nContent Guidelines: \n- Base on NIST principles (stakeholder\
  \ comms in IR phases; complete truncated sections: 'principles of incident handling include stakeholder identification for\
  \ effective Preparation/Response').\n- Include prior knowledge (IR lifecycle), step-by-step processes, sample templates,\
  \ internal/external distinctions, concept map elements.\n- Ensure accuracy: High voter consensus (82.9%).\n- Cards promote\
  \ active recall: Varied types (10 MCQ, 5 short answer, 5 scenario/application).\n\nOutput ONLY as a numbered list of 20\
