active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a ransomware attack on a hospital, rank the following constituents by priority (patients, staff, regulators,
    media, suppliers) and debate how priorities might shift over time (e.g., during containment vs. recovery). Justify using
    criteria like impact, urgency, and influence.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
