  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains Exit Management vs. Transition Management using a self-drawn flowchart (including
    lessons learned and stakeholder handoff). The partner provides teach-back by summarizing and quizzing with one example
    question. Switch roles; discuss common misconceptions like skipping documentation.
  problem_solving: Analyze the Equifax 2017 breach post-incident failures (e.g., inadequate lessons learned leading to repeated
    vulnerabilities). In small teams, design an improved transition plan with steps for verification, stakeholder reporting,
    policy updates, and 30-day monitoring. Present and peer-review using rubrics aligned to NIST standards.

    2) Conceptual (common mix-up, e.g., ''Reporting only'' vs. full closure), 3) Extreme (too broad/narrow, e.g., ''Immediate
    shutdown''). Ensure plausible for learners at intermediate level; avoid obvious wrongs.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Incident Response. Topic:
  Exit and Transition Management (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > 002_Incident Response And Forensics > 002_Incident Response Team
  Organization > 007_Constituency and Stakeholder Management > Relationship Management > Exit and Transition Management).
  Use provided research context (NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 Recover function for accurate guidance; note no Rev. 3 exists as of
  2023), voter consensus (87.1% approval), and pedagogical best practices.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives (span Bloom''s: Remember e.g. define components; Understand e.g. explain lessons learned; Apply e.g.
  checklists; Analyze e.g. Equifax case; Evaluate e.g. NIST critique; Create e.g. design strategy).

  - Active learning ties (debate resolution criteria, peer flowchart teach-back, Equifax redesign).

  - Scaffolding: Layer 1 Foundation (definitions), Layer 2 Components (frameworks), Layer 3 Implementation (steps), Layer
  4 Integration (cross-domain).

  - Prerequisites: IR lifecycle, stakeholder comms.

  Follow schema strictly: Varied Q types (40% MCQ w/ 3 distractors via protocol, 30% short answer, 30% scenario/open), explanations
  with sources/real-world, no duplicates. Ensure active recall, spaced repetition optimization (concise fronts, rich backs).
  Output only the JSON array.'
