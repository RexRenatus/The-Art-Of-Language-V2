active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In groups, debate the trade-offs between physical labels (e.g., barcodes, QR codes, RFID) and digital
    alternatives for hardware assets in high-security environments like data centers or OT systems. Consider durability, tampering
    risks, inventory accuracy, and compliance. Reference NISTIR 8011 (HWAM risks), NISTIR 7693 (asset identification), CISA
    OT guidelines, and CIS CSC 1 (Inventory of Enterprise Assets). Each group presents one pro/con argument.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (4 options, 1 correct): Create 3 plausible distractors from misconceptions/common errors:
    1) Confuse physical/digital (e.g., ''RFID is software-only''); 2) Ignore context (e.g., ''Barcodes for OT only''); 3)
    Overgeneralize standards (e.g., ''ISO 27001 A.8 is for digital tags''). Ensure distractors are realistic, from research
    context/voter notes (e.g., unmanaged devices, durability).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university pedagogy (Bloom''s
  Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality, optimized flashcards for the topic ''Hardware Asset Labels''
  (Category: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and Asset Classification > Asset and Information Labeling > Physical
  Labeling Methods > Hardware Asset Labels).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the 6 objectives above]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste the 4 layers above]

  - Active Learning: Draw from discussions/exercises for scenario cards.

  - Research Context: Core concepts from NISTIR 7693 (asset ID), NISTIR 8011 Vol.2 (HWAM, unmanaged risks), CIS CSC 1-2 (enterprise
  assets inventory), CISA OT guidelines, ISO 27001 A.8. Best practices: Durability (weatherproof), tamper-evident labels (void/holograms),
  types (barcodes/QR/RFID/stickers), lifecycle tracking, CMDB integration.

  - Prior Knowledge: Link to basic IT inventory.


  Output EXACTLY 30 flashcards following this schema: JSON array of objects with keys: ''id'' (1-30), ''type'' (''definition'',
  ''mcq'', ''cloze'', ''scenario''), ''bloom_level'' (match objectives), ''front'' (question/prompt), ''back'' (answer + explanation
  + ref + distractor rationale if MCQ), ''tags'' (array e.g. [''HWAM'', ''layer2'']), ''source'' (e.g., ''NISTIR 7693'').


  Distribute: 8 Remember/Understand (Layer 1-2), 10 Apply/Analyze (Layer 2-3), 8 Evaluate (Layer 3-4), 4 Create (Layer 4).
  12 MCQs with 4 options (label A/B/C/D in front/back). Ensure variety, no repetition, misconceptions in distractors. Promote
  higher-order thinking and real-world application.'
