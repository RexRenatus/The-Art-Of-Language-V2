active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges of prioritizing IT versus OT assets in an asset register
    during a merger scenario. How does this impact attack surface reduction? Reference ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A.8 and real-world
    cases like SolarWinds.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    1. Common misconception (e.g., confuse asset register with vulnerability scan).

    2. Partial truth (e.g., correct for IT but wrong for OT).

    3. Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., ''never automate'' vs. ''always automate''). Ensure distractors test nuance, not
    trivia.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Asset Security. Use Bloom's\
