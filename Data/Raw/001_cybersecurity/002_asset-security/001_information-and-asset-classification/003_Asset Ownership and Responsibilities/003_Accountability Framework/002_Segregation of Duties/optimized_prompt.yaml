active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the challenges of implementing Segregation of Duties in a small cybersecurity team versus a
    large enterprise. What trade-offs exist between security and operational efficiency? Provide real-world examples from
    NIST frameworks or CISSP case studies, and debate how automation tools can optimize SoD without compromising accountability.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Related but incorrect control (e.g., ''AC-2 instead of AC-5''); 3) Partial truth (e.g., ''Single approver OK if audited'').
    Ensure distractors test deeper understanding, not trivia.'

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE] - Reference in explanations.

  - Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL 4 LAYERS FROM ABOVE] - Distribute cards across layers (20% Layer 1, 30% Layer 2, 30% Layer 3,
  20% Layer 4).

  - Content Sources: NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 (AC-5: Separation of Duties - identify duties, define access); CISSP Domain 2; NIST
  800-37 Risk Mgmt; Web context on fraud prevention, error reduction, conflicts.


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (10 Basic Q&A, 20 MCQ, 10 Cloze, 10 Application). Use exact schema:

  Ensure progression: Lower Bloom''s early, higher later. Cover prerequisites (asset classification), misconceptions, concept
  map (SoD central → branches → NIST links). Big picture: SoD protects classified assets via accountability, reduces insider
  threats, enables compliance.
