  discussion_prompt: 'Debate: In a hospital sharing patient records with a cloud provider for storage, is the hospital the
    sole data controller, or could the cloud provider be a joint controller? Use ICO criteria (e.g., who decides purposes/means,
    access, retention) to argue your position and reference real-world examples.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Context/Topic Hierarchy**: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and Asset Classification > Asset Ownership and
  Responsibilities > Data and Asset Roles > Data Controller Role and Responsibilities.


  **Learning Objectives** (Bloom''s): [Insert full list from JSON above].


  **Scaffolding Content** (use as source material): [Insert full scaffolding_layers content from JSON above].


  **Active Learning Integration**: Draw scenarios from discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving for applied cards.


  **Voter Consensus**: 85.7% approval; emphasize completeness (full ICO indicators/responsibilities), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression).


  **Output Format**: JSON array of objects, e.g. [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'', ''opt3'']}, ''metadata'': {...}}]. Strictly follow flashcard_schema. Ensure web-grounded
  (ICO/GDPR), distractors plausible, explanations tie to objectives/layers.'
