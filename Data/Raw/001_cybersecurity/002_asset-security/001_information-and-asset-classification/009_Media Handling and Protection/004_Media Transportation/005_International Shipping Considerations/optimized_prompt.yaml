active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between cost, speed, and security when selecting carriers
    for international shipment of classified media (e.g., FedEx vs. specialized couriers). Use real-world examples like ITAR
    violations to support arguments and propose mitigations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors:

    1. Common misconception (e.g., ''No encryption needed for domestic shipments'' – wrong for international).

    2. Related but incorrect concept (e.g., confuse ITAR with EAR applicability).

    3. Extreme/overly simplistic option (e.g., ''Ship via regular mail'' vs. vetted courier).

    Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter-noted mismatches (e.g., maritime IT/OT vs. media transport).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in CISSP-aligned Asset Security
  domains. Topic: ''International Shipping Considerations'' under hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information
  and Asset Classification > Media Handling and Protection > Media Transportation.


  CRITICAL: Focus EXCLUSIVELY on secure international transport of physical/classified media/assets (e.g., encrypted drives,
  tapes), NOT maritime IT/OT cybersecurity on ships. Emphasize: chain of custody, encryption (AES-256/FIPS), export controls
  (ITAR/EAR), customs, packaging, risks (theft/tampering/data sovereignty). Sources: NIST SP 800-88, 22 CFR ITAR, OCIMF adapted
  for media, Wassenaar.
