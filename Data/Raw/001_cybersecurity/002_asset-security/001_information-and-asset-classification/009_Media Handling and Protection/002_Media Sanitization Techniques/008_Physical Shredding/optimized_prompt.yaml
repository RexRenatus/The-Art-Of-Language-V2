active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages and risks of on-site versus off-site physical shredding
    services for an organization handling classified government data. Consider factors like chain of custody, cost, compliance
    with NIST SP 800-88, and breach prevention.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Similar but incorrect term/level (e.g., NIST rating instead of DIN P); 3) Edge case or outdated standard (e.g., pre-DIN
    66399 levels). Ensure correct answer is unambiguous; distractors from real standards but mismatched.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in asset security and media
  sanitization. Generate 30 high-quality flashcards on ''Physical Shredding'' using the provided schema. Strictly adhere to
  university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives, active learning ties, 4-layer scaffolding, voter consensus (full P-1
  to P-7 ratings, NIST/ISO/DIN standards, chain of custody, on-site/off-site). Topic hierarchy: Level 1 Cybersecurity > Level
  2 Asset Security > Level 3 Information and Asset Classification > Level 4 Media Handling and Protection > Level 5 Media
  Sanitization Techniques > Level 6 Physical Shredding.
