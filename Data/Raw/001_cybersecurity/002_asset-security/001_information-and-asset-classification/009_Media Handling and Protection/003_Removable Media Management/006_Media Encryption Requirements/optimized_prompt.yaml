active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of implementing Full Disk Encryption (FDE) versus file-level
    encryption for removable media in a healthcare organization handling HIPAA-regulated data. Consider usability, performance
    overhead, and recovery scenarios from NIST SP 800-88.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
