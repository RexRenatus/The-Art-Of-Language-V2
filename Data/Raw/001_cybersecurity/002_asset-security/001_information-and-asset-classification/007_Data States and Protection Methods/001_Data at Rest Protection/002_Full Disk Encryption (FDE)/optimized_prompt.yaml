active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of FDE versus file-level encryption for protecting data at rest in a remote work
    environment. Consider factors such as security comprehensiveness, performance overhead, manageability, user experience,
    and compliance requirements (e.g., NIST SP 800-111). Groups should present pros/cons and recommend a hybrid approach if
    applicable.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]. Use 4-layer scaffolding: [INSERT scaffolding JSON HERE]. Incorporate active learning
  for deeper recall: [INSERT active_learning JSON HERE].


  Content must be comprehensive: Include core concepts (FDE, PBA, PBE, data-at-rest, keys, auth), standards (NIST SP 800-111,
  SP 800-57, FIPS AES-256, CIS, ISO 27001), tools (BitLocker, FileVault, LUKS), best practices, risks, comparisons. Voter
  consensus: 100% approval on pedagogy/completeness.


  Follow this schema strictly [INSERT flashcard_schema JSON HERE]. Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'',
  ''explanation'': ''...'', ''tags'': [''tag1'', ''tag2'']}, ...]. Ensure progressive difficulty: 30% Layer 1 (REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND),
