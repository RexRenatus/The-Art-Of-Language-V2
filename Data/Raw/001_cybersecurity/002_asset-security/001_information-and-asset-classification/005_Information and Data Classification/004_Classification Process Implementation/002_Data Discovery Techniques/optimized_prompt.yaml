active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between automated data discovery tools (e.g., Nessus) and manual audits in a hybrid
    cloud environment—when is one preferable over the other, and why? Consider factors like speed, accuracy, and false positives.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Base on common misconceptions (e.g., 'vulnerability scanning' as distractor for data discovery).
    - Use partial truths (e.g., correct framework but wrong function).
    - Incorporate voter-noted errors (e.g., incomplete ISA/IEC 62443 details).
    - Plausible alternatives from research (e.g., NIST vs. CISA for OT).
    - 'Ensure 3 distractors per MCQ: 1 superficially similar, 1 opposite, 1 unrelated.'
