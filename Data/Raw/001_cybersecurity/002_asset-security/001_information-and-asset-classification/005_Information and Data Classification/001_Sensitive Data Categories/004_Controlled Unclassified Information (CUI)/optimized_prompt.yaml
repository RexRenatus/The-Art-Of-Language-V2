active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether the CUI program under EO 13556 effectively balances information sharing
    with security needs amid modern cybersecurity threats. Use evidence from NIST SP 800-171 (e.g., controls for nonfederal
    systems) and real-world contractor challenges (e.g., DFARS compliance) to support your position, addressing trade-offs
    like over-classification vs. protection.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs based on common misconceptions: 1. Confusion with classified/FOUO
    (e.g., ''Requires TS clearance''); 2. Incorrect sources (e.g., ''Governed by NIST SP 800-53 only, not 800-171''); 3. Partial
    truths (e.g., ''CUI Registry is optional for nonfederal''). Ensure distractors are realistic from CUI Registry examples
    or voter-noted errors; label why wrong in explanation.'

  Information (CUI) within the Topic Hierarchy: Level 1: Cybersecurity > Level 2: Asset Security > Level 3: Information and

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (mix 40% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 30% APPLY/ANALYZE, 20% EVALUATE, 10% CREATE) covering
  all Scaffolding Layers progressively (12-13 per layer). Integrate Learning Objectives, Active Learning activities (e.g.,
  classification scenarios), voter examples (Privacy, Proprietary), and Research Context (EO 13556, 32 CFR 2002, NIST SP 800-171/800-53
  Rev.5, CUI Registry at archives.gov/cui). Address misconceptions (CUI ≠ classified/FOUO).


  Use exact Flashcard Schema:

  - Front: Varied question (MCQ with 4 options incl. distractors, cloze, scenario).

  - Back: Answer | Explanation (rationale, source, why distractors wrong, example) | Bloom Level | Scaffolding Layer | Active
  Learning Link.


  Ensure university pedagogy: Active recall, spaced repetition-friendly, scaffolding from foundation to integration. Output
