active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In small groups, debate whether reputational impacts of unauthorized disclosure (e.g., loss of customer
    trust as in Equifax or Target breaches) outweigh financial impacts (e.g., fines and remediation costs). Use NIST guidelines
    and real-world examples to support arguments, then vote and justify the consensus.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Plausible misconceptions: e.g., Confuse ''disclosure'' with ''alteration'' (integrity issue).'
    - 'Similar concepts: e.g., Operational impact distractor as ''only downtime'' (misses productivity).'
    - 'Edge cases: e.g., Low-severity for confidential assets.'
    - 'Real-world twists: e.g., Equifax distractor minimizing reputational harm.'
    - 2-3 distractors per MCQ, balanced difficulty.

  and Asset Classification > Information and Data Classification > Classification Criteria and Methodologies > Impact of Unauthorized
  Disclosure.


  **Context and Content:** Use this hierarchy and research-grounded content:

  - Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and Asset Classification > Information and Data Classification
  > Classification Criteria and Methodologies > Impact of Unauthorized Disclosure.

  - Key Sources: NIST SP 1800-28 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1800-28.pdf) for definitions
  (data confidentiality, breach, assets), impacts (operational: downtime; financial: costs/fines; reputational; privacy: identity
  theft/fraud/distress), and frameworks. Links to GDPR compliance.

  - Scaffolding: Layer 1 (Foundation: defs), Layer 2 (Components: impact types + asset links), Layer 3 (Implementation: assessment
  steps), Layer 4 (Integration: NIST/GDPR/risk mgmt).

  - Big Picture: Ties to classification for preventing breaches.


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s):** [Insert full list from above].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Draw from discussion (reputational vs financial), peer teaching (impact types), problem-solving
  (hospital leak scenario) for scenario cards.


  **Flashcard Schema:** [Insert full schema from above]. Strictly follow format: Output as JSON array of cards, each with
  ''front'', ''back'' object (answer, explanation, bloom_level, layer, source).


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards: Balanced by Bloom''s (30% lower, 40% middle, 30% higher) and layers. Ensure active
  recall, distractors per protocol, university-level rigor. No spoilers on fronts.'
