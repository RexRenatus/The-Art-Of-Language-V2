        "core_logic": "Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) is critical because threats can be introduced at any stage of a system's lifecycle, from development to disposal, via components or services acquired externally. These threats, such as counterfeit parts or malicious code, can compromise the confidentiality of CUI.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors misrepresent the purpose of SCRM by focusing on performance, cost, or general procurement rules. The core objective is identifying and mitigating security risks introduced through the supply chain that could impact CUI.",
        "analogy": "SCRM is like vetting the suppliers for ingredients in a sensitive food product. You need to ensure the suppliers aren't introducing contaminants (threats) that could harm consumers (compromise CUI)."
