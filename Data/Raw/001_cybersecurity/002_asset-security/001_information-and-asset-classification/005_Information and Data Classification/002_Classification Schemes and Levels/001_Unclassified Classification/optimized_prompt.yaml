  - Learning Objectives: [insert array above].

  - Active Learning: Use for scenario cards (e.g., discussion debates as prompts).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4.

  - Prior Knowledge: Bridge from basic classification (Public/Internal/Confidential/Restricted).

  - Content Sources: NIST SP 800-171r3 (14 families for nonfederal CUI protection), SP 800-172 (enhanced), SP 800-53; EO 13556/13526;
  32 CFR 2002 marking. Examples: CUI (Privacy/PII, Proprietary Business, Defense Tech); Big Picture: Asset Security CIA for
  unclassified.


  Generate flashcards per EXACT schema: JSON array of objects [{''front'':..., ''back'':{''answer'':..., ''explanation'':...,
  ''bloom_level'':..., ''layer'':..., ''tags'':[...]} }]. Ensure spaced repetition optimization: concise fronts (<20 words),
  rich backs. Varied difficulty, no duplicates. Output ONLY the JSON array.'
