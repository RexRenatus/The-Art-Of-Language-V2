active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a budget-constrained organization, should priority be given to temperature and humidity controls over
    other cybersecurity measures like firewalls? Debate the pros and cons, providing justifications from NIST SP 800-53 PE-14
    and real-world breach examples where environmental failures led to data loss.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Base on common misconceptions (e.g., ''Too wide: 10-40°C'' for ignoring precision; ''Irrelevant: No range needed''
      for cyber-physical disconnect).'
    - 'Use plausible errors: Slightly off ranges (e.g., 20-30°C, 30-70% RH), outdated standards, or swapped risks (e.g., high
      humidity causes ESD).'
    - 'Generate exactly 3 distractors: 1 superficially correct but wrong, 1 extreme/absurd, 1 misconception-based.'
    - Ensure distractors promote analysis (e.g., tempt APPLY-level errors).
