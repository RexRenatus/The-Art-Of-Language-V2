  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the following: ''Should personal devices ever be considered authorized
    processing environments for sensitive data, even with strong controls like MDM and encryption? Use NIST SP 800-53 AC and
    CM controls to support your arguments, and address common misconceptions such as confusing processing with storage only.''
    Encourage critical thinking by requiring participants to reference voter-suggested examples and research definitions.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Asset Security. Generate\
  \ 25 high-quality Anki-style flashcards on 'Authorized Processing Environments' using the exact topic hierarchy: Level 1:\
  \ Cybersecurity, Level 2: Asset Security, Level 3: Information and Asset Classification, Level 4: Asset Handling Requirements,\
  \ Level 5: Usage and Processing Controls, Level 6: Authorized Processing Environments.\n\nIncorporate these pedagogical\
  \ elements:\n- Learning objectives spanning Bloom's Taxonomy (REMEMBER to CREATE) as provided.\n- Scaffolding: Balance cards\
  \ across 4 layers (cite layer in explanations).\n- Active learning ties: Include scenario-based questions mimicking discussion/problem-solving.\n\
  - Prerequisites: Link to asset classification/risk assessment.\n- Concept map: Reference relationships (e.g., controls →\
  \ risk mgmt).\n- Standards: NIST SP 800-53r5 (AC, CM, SC, SI), 800-37r2, ISO/IEC 27001, CIS Controls; cite sources.\n- Examples:\
  \ Authorized vs. unauthorized; misconceptions.\n\nOutput ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards, each matching this schema:\n\
  {\n  \"front\": \"Question? A) opt1 B) opt2 C) opt3 D) opt4\",\n  \"back\": {\n    \"correct_answer\": \"A: Full correct\
