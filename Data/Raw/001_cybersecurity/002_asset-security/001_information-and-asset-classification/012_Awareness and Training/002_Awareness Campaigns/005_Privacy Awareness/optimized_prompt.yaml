active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between privacy protections (e.g., data minimization under NIST Control-P) and
    security needs (e.g., logging for incident response under CIA availability). In groups of 4, argue pro/con positions for
    10 minutes, then synthesize key takeaways as a class, referencing privacy risks and business needs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    risk = loss of data integrity''); 2) Misorder NIST functions (e.g., start with Protect-P); 3) Overgeneralize (e.g., ignore
    data processing lifecycle); 4) Real-world errors (e.g., GDPR vs. NIST mix-up). Ensure plausible, derived from research
    context.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Privacy Awareness (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and Asset Classification > Awareness and Training > Awareness Campaigns
  > Privacy Awareness). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard
  schema to generate 32 high-quality flashcards.


  Incorporate:

  - Voter consensus: SMART objectives, Bloom''s progression, think-pair-share ties, debate on privacy-security trade-offs,
  NIST functions map, misconceptions in distractors.

  - Research context: Definitions (privacy awareness, data processing, privacy risk, problematic data action), NIST Privacy
  Framework (Functions: Identify-P, Govern-P, Control-P, Communicate-P, Protect-P), asset security in CIA context.

  - Pedagogy: Cover all Bloom''s levels; scaffold from foundation to integration; link to prerequisites (CIA triad, data classification).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"front": "...", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "bloom_level":
  "...", "scaffolding_layer": "...", "prerequisite_link": "..."}}.


  Distribute: 40% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND (Layers 1-2), 30% APPLY/ANALYZE (Layers 2-3), 30% EVALUATE/CREATE (Layers 3-4). Include
  12 MCQs with distractors. Ensure active learning ties (e.g., cards prompting debate scenarios). Make explanations educational
  for self-assessment.'
