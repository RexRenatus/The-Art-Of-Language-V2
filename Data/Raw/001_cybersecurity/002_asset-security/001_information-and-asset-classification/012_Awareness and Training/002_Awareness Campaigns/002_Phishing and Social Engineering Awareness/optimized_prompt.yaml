learning_objectives:
  analyze:
  - objective: 'Compare susceptibility factors across demographics: e.g., older adults (>65) are more vulnerable due to lower
      tech familiarity (Verizon DBIR 2023); mixed gender findings—some studies show women slightly more susceptible to spear-phishing
      due to trust biases (Computers in Human Behavior, 2019), while others find no significant difference; lower cybersecurity
      awareness increases risk regardless of demographics.'
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  understand:
  - objective: Explain how social engineering exploits human psychology, including principles like authority, urgency, and
      reciprocity (e.g., Cialdini's principles).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Identify phishing indicators (e.g., suspicious URLs, urgency, spoofed sender) in sample emails, SMS, or calls.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  evaluate:
  - objective: Critique the effectiveness of an awareness campaign based on coverage of psychological exploits and demographic
      targeting.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  create:
  - objective: Design a phishing awareness poster or email simulation that integrates asset classification (e.g., warning
      against sharing confidential data) and promotes reporting.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  remember:
  - objective: 'Define key terms: phishing, spear phishing, vishing, smishing, and social engineering.'
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - Learning objectives: [paste from above]

  - Active learning: Tie cards to activities (e.g., ''Apply to debate: ...'')

  - Scaffolding: Tag each card to a layer.

  - Prior knowledge: Link to asset classification (phishing bypasses via humans).

  - Cross-links: Psychology (Cialdini), incident response.
