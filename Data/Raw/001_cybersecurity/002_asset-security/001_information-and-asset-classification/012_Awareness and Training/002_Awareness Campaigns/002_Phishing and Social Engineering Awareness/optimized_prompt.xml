  <learning_objectives level="bloom_taxonomy">
    <objective level="remember" measurable="true">Define key terms: phishing, spear phishing, vishing, smishing, and social engineering.</objective>
    <objective level="understand" measurable="true">Explain how social engineering exploits human psychology, including principles like authority, urgency, and reciprocity (e.g., Cialdini's principles).</objective>
    <objective level="apply" measurable="true">Identify phishing indicators (e.g., suspicious URLs, urgency, spoofed sender) in sample emails, SMS, or calls.</objective>
    <objective level="analyze" measurable="true">Compare susceptibility factors across demographics: e.g., older adults (&gt;65) are more vulnerable due to lower tech familiarity (Verizon DBIR 2023); mixed gender findings—some studies show women slightly more susceptible to spear-phishing due to trust biases (Computers in Human Behavior, 2019), while others find no significant difference; lower cybersecurity awareness increases risk regardless of demographics.</objective>
    <objective level="evaluate" measurable="true">Critique the effectiveness of an awareness campaign based on coverage of psychological exploits and demographic targeting.</objective>
    <objective level="create" measurable="true">Design a phishing awareness poster or email simulation that integrates asset classification (e.g., warning against sharing confidential data) and promotes reporting.</objective>

    <system_prompt>You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Phishing and Social Engineering Awareness (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity &gt; Asset Security &gt; Information and Asset Classification &gt; Awareness and Training &gt; Awareness Campaigns &gt; Phishing and Social Engineering Awareness). Consensus: 68.6% approval from 7 voters emphasizing completeness (susceptibility demographics), Bloom's progression, active learning, 4-layer scaffolding.
Use this content:
[Insert full research context here, including completed susceptibility: Demographics—Age (older more per Verizon DBIR); Gender (mixed, women higher spear-phishing susceptibility due to trust [MDPI 2024]); Other: Low awareness/tech skills. Sources: CISA, Proofpoint, etc.]
Incorporate:
- Learning objectives: [paste from above]
- Active learning: Tie cards to activities (e.g., 'Apply to debate: ...')
- Scaffolding: Tag each card to a layer.
- Prior knowledge: Link to asset classification (phishing bypasses via humans).
- Cross-links: Psychology (Cialdini), incident response.
Generate flashcards per schema: [paste schema]. Ensure distractors are research-backed misconceptions. Output ONLY valid JSON array: [{'front': '...', 'back': {'answer': '...', 'explanation': '...', 'bloom_level': '...', 'layer': 1, 'distractors': ['opt1', 'opt2']}}, ...]. Vary difficulty, cover all objectives/layers.</system_prompt>
