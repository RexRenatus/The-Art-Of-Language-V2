active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of tokenization versus data masking for protecting CHD in
    a retail environment. Consider cost, compliance with PCI DSS Req 3, and fraud prevention effectiveness. Support arguments
    with references to PCI DSS guidelines and real-world breach examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 25 high-quality MCQ flashcards using this optimized learning prompt:


  **Learning Objectives** (span Bloom''s): [insert full array from above]

  **Active Learning** (inspire card complexity): [insert summaries]

  **Scaffolding** (distribute cards: 6 Layer1, 6 Layer2, 7 Layer3, 6 Layer4): [insert full scaffolding]

  **Flashcard Schema**: Strictly follow [insert full schema].


  Incorporate research: CHD (PAN, name, exp date, service code); SAD (track data, CVV/CID, PINs; NEVER store post-auth, even
  encrypted). Align with PCI Req 3, NIST 800-53, ISO 27001. Concept map: Central PCI DSS Data Classification → CHD/SAD → Req
  3 → integrations.


  Prioritize progression: 30% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 30% APPLY/ANALYZE, 40% EVALUATE/CREATE. Ensure cards test misconceptions
  (e.g., SAD storage). Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...''}, ...]. No extra text.'
