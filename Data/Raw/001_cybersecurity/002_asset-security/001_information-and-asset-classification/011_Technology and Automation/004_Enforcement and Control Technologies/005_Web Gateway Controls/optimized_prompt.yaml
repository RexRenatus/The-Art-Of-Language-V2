active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given the balance between security and user privacy, should web gateway controls include full URL logging
    and inspection of HTTPS traffic? Divide into teams to debate pros (e.g., threat detection per NIST SP 800-53 SC-7 Boundary
    Protection) and cons (e.g., privacy risks per GDPR), using real-world examples like phishing campaigns. Address misconceptions
    that gateways only filter HTTP.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Base on common misconceptions: e.g., confuse DLP with content filtering (DLP scans content for sensitivity, filtering
      blocks categories); web gateways with firewalls (gateways inspect web/app-layer, firewalls network-layer).'
    - 'Use partial truths: e.g., ''Only filters HTTP'' (ignores HTTPS).'
    - 'Incorporate real-world errors: e.g., ''Firewalls handle DLP'' (no, specialized).'
    - 'Plausible alternatives from standards: e.g., wrong CIS control number.'
    - Ensure 3 distractors per MCQ, balanced difficulty.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert cybersecurity flashcard generator using university-style pedagogy (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active
  learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality flashcards for ''Web Gateway Controls'' in Cybersecurity > Asset Security
  > Information and Asset Classification > Technology and Automation > Enforcement and Control Technologies > Web Gateway
  Controls.


  **Content Foundation:** Use this comprehensive summary:

  - Web gateways control web traffic to prevent threats, enforce policies (threat prevention, DLP, access control, content
  filtering, monitoring).

  - Standards: NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 (SC-7 Boundary Protection, SI-4 Monitoring, nist.gov); CIS Controls v8 (CSC 3 Secure Configurations,
  cisecurity.org); ACSC Essential Eight (web filtering strategies, cyber.gov.au).

  - Scaffolding: [Insert full scaffolding_layers from above].


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full learning_objectives array]. Strictly align flashcards to these.


  **Active Learning Integration:** Include 4-6 cards prompting discussion/peer teach/problem-solving (e.g., ''Debate: HTTPS
  inspection pros/cons?''), referencing provided activities.


  **Flashcard Output:** Strictly JSON array of objects matching this schema: [Insert full flashcard_schema.structure]. Follow
  distractor protocol exactly. Ensure explanations link to objectives, layers, standards, and address misconceptions (e.g.,
  gateways vs firewalls, DLP vs filtering).


  Generate exactly 25 flashcards: 10 MCQ, 10 short answer, 5 scenario. Cover all Bloom''s levels (1-2 per level), all layers
  (6-7 per layer). Output only valid JSON array, no extra text.'
