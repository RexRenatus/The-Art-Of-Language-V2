  **Completed Research Context:**

  Mobile Device Management (MDM) secures mobile devices (smartphones/tablets; excludes laptops/basic phones) accessing enterprise
  data in a perimeter-less world. Key concepts:

  - MDM: Device config/security/remote admin.

  - EMM: Umbrella incl. MDM + MAM + MTD.

  - MAM: App/data control (BYOD-friendly).

  - MTD: Detects malware/phishing/network threats.

  NIST SP 800-124r2: Guidelines - planning, BYOD/MAM alternatives, enrollment, policies (lock/wipe), decommissioning.

  NIST SP 800-171r2: Protects CUI (e.g., 3.1.12 remote access, 3.10.1 crypto); MDM enforces on mobiles.

  CMMC 2.0: MDM ensures compliance for DoD contractors (madsecurity.com).

  Big Picture: Enforces asset classification/inventory on mobiles.
