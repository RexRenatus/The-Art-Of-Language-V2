active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the security trade-offs of warm storage (3-12 months) versus hot or cold storage. Discuss how
    increased accessibility affects RTO/RPO, risks like unauthorized access, and cost-compliance balance. Incorporate case
    studies from recent breaches (e.g., data exfiltration incidents) to evaluate real-world implications.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    hot''); 2) Close-but-wrong (e.g., mix NIST pubs: 800-171r3 vs 800-209); 3) Opposites/extremes (e.g., ''no encryption needed
    for warm''); 4) Partial truths (e.g., wrong timeframe: 1-3 months). Base on voter-noted errors like tier confusion, security
    assumptions.'
