active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a ransomware attack scenario, debate whether backup catalog accuracy verification alone is sufficient
    for recovery or if full restoration tests are essential. Cite NIST CSF RC.RP-03 ('The integrity of backups and other restoration
    assets is verified before using them for restoration') and SP 800-53 CP-9 enhancements (e.g., (1) for testing). Support
    arguments with real-world examples from sources like csf.tools.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    replaces full restores'' vs. RC.RP-03 requiring integrity before use); 2) Partial truths (e.g., ''Test only full backups''
    ignoring incrementals); 3) Unrelated/mixed concepts (e.g., confuse CP-9 with CP-4); 4) Voter-suggested errors (e.g., ignoring
    catalog corruption). Ensure distractors promote analysis (e.g., sound right but fail evaluation).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Asset Security (Backup

  100% approval on pedagogy, completeness, problem-solving.


  Incorporate:

  - **Learning Objectives**: [Paste the learning_objectives array above].

  - **Active Learning**: [Paste active_learning object]. Use in explanations.

  - **Scaffolding**: [Paste scaffolding object]. Distribute cards evenly across layers.

  - **Research Context**: Backup catalogs index backups for restoration; verify integrity (checksums, no corruption/compromise)
  per NIST CSF RC.RP-03 (csf.tools/#rc.rp-03) and SP 800-53 CP-9 (System Backup, enhancements (1) Test Backup Information,
  (2) Frequency; csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5). Essential for business continuity vs. ransomware/etc.

  - **Concept Map**: Central: Backup Catalog Accuracy Verification → NIST CP-9/CP-9(1)/RC.RP-03, Integrity Checks (checksums/sampling),
  Dependencies (backups), Outcomes (restoration confidence).

  - **Prior Knowledge**: Backup types (full/incremental), data integrity basics.

  - **Misconceptions**: Backups always accurate; catalog verification = full restore.


  Generate flashcards per **Flashcard Schema** [paste schema above]. Ensure university pedagogy: Bloom''s progression, active
  recall, spaced repetition-friendly. Cover all voter priorities (e.g., NIST completion, exercises). Output only the flashcards
  in JSON array format: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'',
  ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''source'': ''...''}}, ...]. No extra text.'
