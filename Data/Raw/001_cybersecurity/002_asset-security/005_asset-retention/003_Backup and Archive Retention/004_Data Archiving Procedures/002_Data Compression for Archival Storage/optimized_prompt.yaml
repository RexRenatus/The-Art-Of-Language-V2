active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss the trade-offs between lossless and lossy compression for archival storage in cybersecurity contexts.
    When might lossy be justifiable for non-critical assets, and what risks does it pose to asset security? Provide examples
    from compliance standards like HIPAA or GDPR.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Topic Hierarchy:** Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Retention > Backup and Archive Retention > Data Archiving Procedures
  > Data Compression for Archival Storage.


  **Complete Research Context:**

  - **Core Concepts:** Data compression reduces bits by eliminating redundancy. Lossless (e.g., exact reconstruction: gzip/DEFLATE,
  bzip2/BWT, LZMA) essential for archival integrity. Lossy (discards data) unsuitable for critical assets. Archival storage:
  long-term preservation for compliance. Asset Security: protects data per CIA triad.

  - **Standards:** CCSDS 650.0-M-3 (OAIS Reference Model, ISO 14721: Space/agency-agnostic; entities: Ingest, Archival Storage
  (AIP with compression), Administration, Data Management, Preservation Planning, Access. Compression in packaging for efficiency/longevity.
  CCSDS 120.0-G-4: Lossless compression guidelines. NIST SP 800-53: MP-6 (encrypt/compress media), RA-3 risk assessment for
  retention.

  - **Tools/Best Practices:** gzip (fast), bzip2 (better ratio), LZMA (highest ratio/slowest). Always verify post-compression
  (hashes). Cybersecurity: Compress before encrypt; comply HIPAA/GDPR for retention.

  - **Sources:** CCSDS.org (650.0-M-3, 120.0-G-4); NIST.gov/SP800-53r5; ISO.org/14721; RFC 1951 (DEFLATE).

  - **Concept Map:** Central: Data Compression for Archival Storage → Lossless/Lossy → Standards (OAIS/CCSDS) → Tools (gzip/etc.)
  → Cybersecurity (NIST/HIPAA) → Hierarchy branches.


  **Voter Consensus (82.9% approval):** Emphasize completeness (full OAIS), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression), scaffolding expansion,
  active learning (discussion/trade-offs, problem-solving with tools/OAIS).
