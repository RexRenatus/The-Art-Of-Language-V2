    might select) and 'explanation' (why wrong, linking to correct concept). Ensure distractors test nuance, not trivia.

  ## GDPR Right to Erasure Implementation: Comprehensive Summary


  **Core Concepts:**

  - Right to Erasure (''Right to be Forgotten'', Art 17): Data subjects request controllers erase personal data without undue
  delay.

  - Personal Data: Info relating to identified/identifiable person.

  - Data Controller: Determines purposes/means of processing.

  - Data Subject: The person.

  - Data Remanence: Residual data post-deletion; mitigate with secure wipe (e.g., NIST 800-88, tools like sdelete).


  **Grounds for Erasure (Art 17(1)):**

  1. No longer necessary for original purpose.

  2. Withdrawal of consent (no other legal basis).

  3. Unlawful processing.

  4. Objection to processing (no overriding legitimate grounds).

  5. Legal obligation to erase.

  6. Child''s consent for info society services.


  **Controller Obligations (Art 17(2)):**

  - Erase data + copies/backups.

  - Cease processing/public dissemination.

  - Notify processors/third parties of erasure request.


  **Exceptions (Art 17(3)):** No erasure if:

  a. Freedom of expression/information.

  b. Legal obligation/public task requiring retention.

  c. Public interest (health).

  d. Archiving/public interest/historical research/scientific/statistical purposes (with safeguards).

  e. Establish/exercise/defend legal claims.


  **Implementation Procedures:**

  1. Verify identity/authenticity.

  2. Assess grounds/exceptions.

  3. Data discovery (data maps, inventories).

  4. Secure deletion (overwrite, cryptographic erase; handle backups/remanence).

  5. Notify recipients/processors.

  6. Document (audit trail for DPO/audits).


  **Challenges:** Data remanence (multi-pass wipes), distributed systems (SaaS), litigation holds, automation (e.g., pseudonymization
  limits scope).


  **Real-World:** Google Spain (2014 CJEU: delink search results); Fines: Meta €1.2B (2023 transfers, indirect); TikTok €345M
  (2023 child data). ICO: 30-day response typical.
