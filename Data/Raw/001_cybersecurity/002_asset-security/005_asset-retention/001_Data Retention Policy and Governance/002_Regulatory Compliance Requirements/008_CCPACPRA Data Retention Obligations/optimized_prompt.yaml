  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student teaches 'data minimization' (collect/retain only what's necessary) vs. 'purpose limitation'
    (retain only for specified purposes) using non-examples like 'retaining data indefinitely for future marketing'—switch
    roles and provide feedback.
  problem_solving: 'Given a retail company scenario retaining purchase history for 7 years: Determine CPRA compliance, identify
    violations (e.g., not ''reasonably necessary''), and redesign a compliant policy with timelines, automation, and SPI handling.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education (CISSP-aligned). Topic: CCPA/CPRA Data Retention
  Obligations (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Retention > Data Retention Policy and Governance > Regulatory
  Compliance Requirements > CCPA/CPRA Data Retention Obligations).


  Content Context: CCPA (as amended by CPRA) requires data retention ''reasonably necessary and proportionate'' to purposes;
  data minimization; PI (broad identifiers); SPI (SSN, health, etc.); disclose in notices; link to deletion rights. Sources:
  oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa, trustarc.com/resource/ccpa-guide, secureprivacy.ai/blog/cpra-data-retention. Prior: Data classification,
  GDPR basics. Big Picture: Reduces breach risks in asset lifecycle.
