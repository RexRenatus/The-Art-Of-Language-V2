  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full learning_objectives JSON above]

  - Active Learning: [insert summaries of discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving]

  - Scaffolding: Use 4 layers progressively [insert full scaffolding_layers JSON above].

  - Research Context: Core concepts (retention schedule, disposition authority, safe harbor, ICT data, records management,
  info systems security records). Standards: NARA GRS 3.2 [archives.gov/records-mgmt/grs], NIST CSF Govern [nist.gov/cyberframework],
  UK GDPR storage limitation [ico.org.uk]. Steps: Inventory, map, define, approve, monitor. Sources: [archives.un.org], [esd.whs.mil],
  [archives.gov].

  - Formative Assessments: Include voter MCQs (e.g., retention schedule def, safe harbor, NARA GRS 3.2) with feedback.
