    2) Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Annual only, ignore regulations''); 3) Extreme/alternative (e.g., ''Monthly
    reviews for all policies''). Base on real-world errors from NIST case studies or GDPR non-compliance examples.'

  Use the following to generate 50-100 high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized flashcards:


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full array from above]


  **Active Learning:** Incorporate ties to [discussion_prompt], [peer_teaching_activity], [problem_solving_exercise].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** Build progressively: [layer1_foundation], [layer2_components], [layer3_implementation], [layer4_integration].
  Balance cards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 30% Layer 3, 20% Layer 4.


  **Bloom''s Coverage:** 20% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate, 20% Create.


  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly output array of JSON objects as specified: {''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}}. Ensure
  university pedagogy: active recall, scaffolding, distractors.


  **Sources:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (PM family controls), NIST CSF 2.0 (Govern function), GDPR Article 5/25 (data retention/storage
  limitation).


  Generate cards covering: definitions, processes, checklists, gap analysis, critiques, plans. Voter priorities: measurable
  outcomes, practical steps, concept maps. Output ONLY the JSON array of flashcards.'
