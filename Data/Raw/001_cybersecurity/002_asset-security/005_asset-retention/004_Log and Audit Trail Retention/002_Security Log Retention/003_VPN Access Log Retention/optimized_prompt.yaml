active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a post-breach scenario, should organizations retain VPN access logs for 1 year, 5 years, or indefinitely?
    Debate the trade-offs between security benefits (e.g., forensic analysis), privacy concerns (e.g., GDPR data minimization),
    storage costs, and regulatory compliance, using NIST SP 800-92 as a reference.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Logs are optional''
    → distractor: ''No retention required''); 2) Partial truths (e.g., ''90 days'' vs. correct ''1 year''); 3) Confusable
    concepts (e.g., mix NIST with ASD durations); 4) Edge cases (e.g., indefinite vs. regulatory minimum). Ensure distractors
    are realistic from research context.'

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full array from above]

  - Active Learning: Use to inspire scenario-based cards (e.g., debate trade-offs in MCQs).

  - Scaffolding: [insert full prior_knowledge + 4 layers from above]. Base all content on this structure and research context
  (NIST SP 800-92: log mgmt guide, retention factors; ASD Essential Eight: logging for visibility, 3-12+ months; common elements:
  VPN logs include auth, IPs, timestamps; retention trade-offs: security vs. privacy/cost).

  - Prior Knowledge: Assume VPN basics and logging principles known.
