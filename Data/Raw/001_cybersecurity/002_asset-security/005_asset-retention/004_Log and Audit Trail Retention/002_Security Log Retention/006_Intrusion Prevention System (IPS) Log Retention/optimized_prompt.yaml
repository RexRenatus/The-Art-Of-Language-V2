active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a resource-constrained organization, debate whether IPS log retention should prioritize 30 days for
    cost savings or 1 year for forensic depth, citing NIST SP 800-92 retention factors, Microsoft SFI 90-day minimums, PCI-DSS
    1-year requirements, and real-world examples like SolarWinds breach investigations.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one learner explains the rationale for IPS vs. IDS log retention differences (e.g., IPS needs longer
    for proof of prevention); the partner teach-backs by applying it to a compliance scenario like GDPR audit trails, then
    switch roles.
  problem_solving: 'Design a log retention policy for a healthcare firm post-breach: specify retention periods (e.g., 1 year
    per HIPAA influences), storage costs using SIEM tools like Splunk, review cadence (quarterly), and integration with incident
    response.'

  Incorporate this full research context:

  - IPS: Monitors and blocks threats in real-time (vs. IDS alerts only). Logs prove interventions.

  - NIST SP 800-92: Log mgmt guide; retention by business/legal/technical needs (e.g., 3-12 months typical).

  - Microsoft SFI: 90 days min for security logs, 1 year high-risk.

  - PCI-DSS: 1 year cardholder logs; GDPR: Accountability (6-12+ months); HIPAA: 6 years influences.

  - Best practices: SIEM (Splunk/ELK), post-breach extend (SolarWinds example).
