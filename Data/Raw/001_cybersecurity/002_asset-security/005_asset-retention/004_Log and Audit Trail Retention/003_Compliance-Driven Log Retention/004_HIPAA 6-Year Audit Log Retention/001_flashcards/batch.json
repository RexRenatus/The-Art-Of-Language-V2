        "core_logic": "The 'Information system activity review' specification (45 CFR § 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D)) is crucial because it mandates regular examination of audit logs to detect security incidents, thus complementing the 6-year retention requirement by ensuring logs are actively monitored. This functions by establishing a proactive review process, connecting to NIST SP 800-53 AU-6 (Audit Review, Analysis, and Reporting).",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors suggest purposes related to log rotation, access control verification, or automated deletion, which are distinct from the core requirement of actively reviewing logs for security events.",
        "analogy": "Regularly reviewing audit logs is like a security guard regularly checking surveillance footage; it's about actively looking for problems, not just keeping the footage stored."
