  discussion_prompt: In a recent cybersecurity incident, an attacker modified group memberships to gain privileged access.
    Debate the importance of retaining group membership change history for at least 1 year versus indefinite retention, considering
    storage costs, compliance (e.g., NIST AC-2, AU-2, CM-3), and forensic value. Provide pros/cons from different stakeholder
    perspectives (security team, legal, finance).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1 common misconception (e.g., confuse AC-2 with AU-2), 1 related but incorrect
      control (e.g., IA-2 instead of AC-2), 1 extreme/overly broad option (e.g., ''indefinite retention always required'').'
    - 'Base on real-world errors: e.g., mixing logging (AU-2) with access enforcement (AC-6).'

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Research Context: Group Membership Change History records additions/deletions/modifications to security groups for asset
  protection. Key NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 controls: AC-2 (Account Management: AC-2(1) monitoring, AC-2(4) separation, AC-2(7)
  review); AU-2 (Audit Events: log group changes); CM-3 (Configuration Change Control: approve/document/test changes, log
  all); AU-11 (Audit Record Retention: min 1 year or per policy). Sources: NIST SP 800-53r5 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf),
  NIST SP 800-92 (Audit Log Mgmt).
