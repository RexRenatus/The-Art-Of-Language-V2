active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the risks of insufficient log retention post-termination (e.g., insider
    threats, compliance fines) and propose how NIST AU-11 and IR-4 controls mitigate these. Support with real-world examples
    like data breaches involving former employees.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (2) Related but incorrect control (e.g., confuse AU-11 with IR-4), (3) Extreme value (e.g., 1 month vs. 7 years). Ensure
    distractors test subtle understanding.'

  **Completed Research Context:**

  Post-Termination Data Access Log Retention ensures logs of user activities are retained after termination to detect unauthorized
  access, support investigations, and meet compliance (e.g., SOX 7yrs, HIPAA 6yrs). Core concepts: Log data (events), Log
  Management (NIST SP 800-92: generate/transmit/store/dispose), Post-Termination Access (ex-employee risks), Retention (AU-11:
  1-7+ years, immutable). NIST SP 800-53 Rev5: AU family (AU-2 Events, AU-3 Content, AU-6 Review, AU-11 Retention - retain
  per reqs, protect from alteration); IR family (IR-4 Handling - use logs to investigate suspicious activity, IR-5 Monitoring,
  IR-6 Reporting, IR-7 Assistance, IR-8 Plan). Best practices: Automate via SIEM, review post-offboarding. Sources: NIST SP
  800-92 Rev1 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/92/r1/ipd), SP 800-53 Rev5 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final),
  SP 1800-28B (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1800-28.pdf), SP 800-61 Rev2 Incident Handling.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the learning_objectives array here].

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the scaffolding array here].

  **Active Learning Integration:** Embed elements from discussion prompts, peer teaching (e.g., explain controls), and problem-solving
  scenarios into application flashcards.

  **Prior Knowledge:** Assumes familiarity with basic logs (SP 800-92), IAM offboarding (access revocation).


  **Generation Instructions:** Create 25 flashcards covering all Bloom''s levels and scaffolding layers. Use the exact flashcard_schema:
  Mix types, follow distractor_protocol. Ensure progressive difficulty. Output as JSON array of objects, each with: {''type'':
  ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''tags'': [''bloom_level'', ''layer'', ''nist_control'']}.
  Make content precise, exam-ready, no fluff.'
