active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the optimal retention period for vendor due diligence documents in a financial
    institution (e.g., 7 years per PCI DSS vs. longer for GDPR accountability). Consider trade-offs between compliance costs,
    storage security, and audit defensibility in third-party breaches.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Vendor Due Diligence Documentation\
  \ Retention (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Retention > Third-Party/Supply Chain Asset Retention > Vendor\
  \ Risk Assessment Retention > Vendor Due Diligence Documentation Retention).\n\nIncorporate these pedagogical elements:\n\
  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]\n- Active Learning: Use for inspiration (e.g., scenario-based Qs from\
  \ problem-solving).\n- Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers [INSERT FULL LAYERS FROM ABOVE].\n\nGenerate 25\
  \ high-quality flashcards using the exact schema:\n{\n  \"flashcards\": [\n    {\n      \"question\": \"...\",\n      \"\
  options\": [\"A: ...\", \"B: ...\", \"C: ...\", \"D: ...\"],\n      \"correct\": \"A\",\n      \"explanation\": \"...\"\

  \nFollow Flashcard Schema strictly: Multiple-choice with 3 distractors per protocol. Explanations must reference standards\
  \ (NIST SP 800-53, PCI DSS, etc.), layers, and objectives. Ensure progressive complexity (Layer 1 simple recall -> Layer\
  \ 4 synthesis). Voter priorities: Complete/comprehensive (PCI, SOC2, GDPR, 7-yr examples), measurable verbs, big picture\
  \ integration. No fictional info; ground in provided research.\n\nOutput ONLY the JSON."
