active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a debate format, argue for or against a 3-year vs. 7-year retention period for MSP incident response
    documentation, citing NIST RS.AN-06/07, legal risks (e.g., litigation holds), forensic value, storage costs, and regulatory
    requirements (e.g., GDPR Article 5).
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one partner explains NIST IR documentation requirements (e.g., logging detection methods vs. ignoring
    metadata) to the other using teach-back with examples/non-examples; switch roles and provide feedback.
  problem_solving: In groups, design a retention policy for a simulated MSP ransomware incident response, specifying what
    to retain (e.g., logs from all phases), storage methods (immutable encryption), access controls, and retention duration;
    present and critique peer designs.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert cybersecurity educator and flashcard generator specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality, optimized flashcards for the topic ''MSP Incident
  Response Documentation Retention'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Retention > Third-Party and Supply
  Chain Asset Retention > Managed Service Provider (MSP) Retention > MSP Incident Response Documentation Retention).


  Incorporate these EXACT learning objectives: [paste learning_objectives array].


  Use this 4-layer scaffolding for card distribution (20% Layer 1, 30% Layer 2, 30% Layer 3, 20% Layer 4): [paste full scaffolding
  object].


  Embed active learning hooks: Reference debate on retention periods, peer teach-back examples, policy design scenarios in
  explanations/tags.
