      "distractors": [
        {
          "text": "To track supplier contact information for marketing purposes.",
          "misconception": "Targets [purpose misattribution]: Focuses on marketing instead of risk management and prioritization."

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Maintaining a supplier inventory is crucial for C-SCRM because it allows organizations to identify critical suppliers based on their impact on programs and systems, enabling prioritized risk assessment and management efforts.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors misrepresent the purpose of a supplier inventory by linking it to marketing, automated procurement, or geographic restrictions, rather than its core function of risk-based prioritization.",
        "analogy": "A supplier inventory is like a company's org chart for its external partners – it shows who is most critical to operations and needs the most attention."
