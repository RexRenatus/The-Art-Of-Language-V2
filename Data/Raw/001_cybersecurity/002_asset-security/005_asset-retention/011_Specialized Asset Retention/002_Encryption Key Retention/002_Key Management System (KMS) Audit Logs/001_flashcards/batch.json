        "core_logic": "Logging cryptographic operations like 'GenerateDataKey' via CloudTrail is crucial because it records the identity of the requester and the key used, providing essential data for security audits and incident response. This works by capturing the metadata of the API call, not the sensitive key material itself.",

        "analogy": "Logging a 'GenerateDataKey' request is like getting a receipt for a secure document retrieval; the receipt shows who asked for it and from which secure cabinet, but it doesn't contain the document itself."
