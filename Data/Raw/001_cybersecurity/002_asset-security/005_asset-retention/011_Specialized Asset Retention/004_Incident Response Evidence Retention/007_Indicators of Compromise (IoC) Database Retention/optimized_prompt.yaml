  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the ideal IoC retention period (e.g., 90 days vs. 2 years) in small groups, considering legal
    requirements (GDPR: up to 10 years for audits; HIPAA: 6 years), storage costs, and evolving threats. Provide evidence
    from NIST SP 800-61 (incident handling data retention) and SP 800-92 (log retention: 3-6 months online, longer offline).
    Vote on the optimal period and justify with pros/cons.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Retain forever'' vs. cost-balanced);
    2) Partial truth (e.g., ''90 days per NIST 800-61'' – actually framework-specific); 3) Extreme/plausible error (e.g.,
    ''1 week for low-risk'' ignoring regs). Ensure plausible via voter insights (e.g., ''longer always better''). Vary difficulty.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Indicators of Compromise
  (IoC) Database Retention (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Retention > Specialized Asset Retention
  > Incident Response Evidence Retention > IoC Database Retention).


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards optimized for university-level pedagogy using Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, and
  scaffolding. Incorporate research: NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2/3 (incident handling, retain for analysis); SP 800-92 Rev. 1 (logs:
  3-6 months online, 1-7 years archive per regs like GDPR/HIPAA/PCI-DSS); best practices (6-12 months operational, legal holds
  longer; tools: ELK/SIEM; factors: legal/business/threats).


  **Learning Objectives (span all levels):** [Insert full list from above].

  **Active Learning Integration:** Weave in discussion (e.g., retention debates), peer teaching (IoC types/NIST), problem-solving
  (SolarWinds scenarios).

  **Scaffolding:** Distribute across 4 layers [Insert full scaffolding from above].

  **Output Format (JSON array of flashcards):** Each flashcard as object per schema [Insert full flashcard_schema from above].
  Ensure distractors follow protocol. Cards must be comprehensive, evidence-based, and promote active recall. No duplicates;
  vary phrasing for spaced repetition.'
