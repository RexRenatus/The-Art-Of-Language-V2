      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Malware families evolve, changing their infrastructure, TTPs, and associated IoCs over time. Therefore, retaining IoCs related to a specific malware family should be based on how long that family remains an active threat and how quickly it changes. This understanding, often derived from CTI and analysis, informs retention periods because it reflects the IoC's continued relevance and effectiveness in detection.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The correct answer focuses on the dynamic nature of malware families and their infrastructure as the key factor for IoC retention. Distractors focus on technical storage limits, external reporting frequency, or the sheer number of associated hashes, which are secondary to the malware's active threat lifecycle.",
        "analogy": "Deciding how long to keep information about a specific type of car model (malware family) depends on how long that model is actively sold and supported, and how often new versions or recalls (evolution) are issued, not just how many were sold or how often they appear in ads."
