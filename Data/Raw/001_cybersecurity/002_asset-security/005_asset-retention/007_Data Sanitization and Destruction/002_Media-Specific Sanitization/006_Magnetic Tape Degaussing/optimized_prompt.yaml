active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios would degaussing magnetic tapes be preferable to physical destruction, considering
    cost, environmental impact, regulatory compliance (e.g., NIST SP 800-88, HIPAA for patient data), and data sensitivity?
    Debate trade-offs with a partner, such as reusability vs. complete irreversibility.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Degaussing uses heat''
    instead of magnetic field); 2) Partial truth (e.g., wrong coercivity threshold); 3) Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g.,
    ''Always preferable to destruction''). Base on voter risks (mismatch, validation) and research (coercivity, EPL).'

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use discussion, peer teaching, and problem-solving exercises (e.g., hospital scenario) in scenario cards.

  - Big Picture: Emphasize preventing data breaches, NIST SP 800-88 compliance, full lifecycle, risks (mismatch, remanence),
  standards (NSA EPL, IEEE 2883:2022 for verification).

  - Prior Knowledge: Anchor to magnetic storage basics, CIA triad, general sanitization.


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards following the exact Flashcard Schema:

  - Structure: Basic Q&A, MCQ (4 options), Application/Scenario.

  - Distractor Protocol: 3 plausible per MCQ (misconceptions, partial truths, extremes).

  - Explanations: Justify with sources, link to layers/Bloom''s/active learning.

  - Rules: Balanced coverage (20% Foundation/Remember-Understand, etc.), JSON array output.


  Ensure university-level pedagogy: Active recall, spaced repetition friendly, measurable via Bloom''s. Output ONLY the JSON
  array of flashcards.'
