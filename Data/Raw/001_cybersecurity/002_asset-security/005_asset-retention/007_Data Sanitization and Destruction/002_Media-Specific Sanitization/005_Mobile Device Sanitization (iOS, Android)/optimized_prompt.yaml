  discussion_prompt: 'Debate: ''A standard factory reset is always sufficient for sanitizing mobile devices before disposal.''
    Provide evidence from NIST SP 800-88, iOS/Android specifics, and real-world data remanence cases to support or refute,
    addressing common misconceptions.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

    fully destroys data'' (confuses Clear/Destroy); ''iOS reset bypasses Activation Lock automatically'' (ignores FRP equivalent);
    ''Purge unnecessary for encrypted devices'' (overlooks key remanence); reference real errors from Apple/Android docs/NIST
    warnings.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards on ''Mobile Device Sanitization (iOS,
  Android)'' in the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Retention > Data Sanitization and Destruction
  > Media-Specific Sanitization > Mobile Device Sanitization (iOS, Android).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM learning_objectives ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding: Cover all 4 layers progressively [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING DETAILS ABOVE].

  - Active learning hooks: End each back with a mini-prompt inspired by [INSERT ACTIVE LEARNING DETAILS ABOVE].

  - Voter priorities: Include complete iOS steps (disable Find My, Erase All Content and Settings), Android (Factory Data
  Reset, FRP, ADB), NIST Clear/Purge/Destroy, remanence warnings, MDM/EMM, sources (NIST SP 800-88 Rev1, Apple Support, Android
  Help).

  - Prior knowledge: Link to flash memory, data classification.


  Use EXACT flashcard schema: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD_SCHEMA ABOVE]. Balance types across Bloom''s/scaffolding. Ensure distractors
  target misconceptions (e.g., factory reset = destruction). Output ONLY as numbered list: 1. Front || Back (JSON-parsable
  back object). No intros/conclusions.'
