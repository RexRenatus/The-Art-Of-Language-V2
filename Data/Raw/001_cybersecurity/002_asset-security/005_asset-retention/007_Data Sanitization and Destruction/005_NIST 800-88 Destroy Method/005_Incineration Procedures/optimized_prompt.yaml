active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using incineration versus other Destroy methods (e.g.,
    shredding or disintegration) for sanitizing high-confidentiality ISM in a data breach scenario. Reference NIST SP 800-88
    and prior knowledge of data classification to justify positions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Incineration is a Purge method''), 2) Related
      but incorrect media (e.g., ''Only for paper, not HDDs''), 3) Partial truth exaggerated (e.g., ''Requires only 500°C'').'
    - 'Base on voter priorities: Include distractors testing incomplete procedures (e.g., skipping verification) or federal
      guidelines.'
    - Ensure distractors promote analysis (e.g., confuse with Clear/Purge).
    quantity: 20-30 flashcards total, balanced across Bloom's levels and scaffolding layers (5 per layer).
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST standards. Generate
  25 high-quality flashcards on ''Incineration Procedures'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Retention
  > Data Sanitization and Destruction > NIST 800-88 Destroy Method > Incineration Procedures).


  Incorporate:

  - Research context: Incineration is a Destroy method per NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 2 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-88r1),
  burning media to ash (>1000°C, 2+ hours) for hard copy/ISM, rendering recovery infeasible. Federal agencies base on confidentiality
  (FIPS 199). Best practices: PPE, ventilation, chain-of-custody, ash verification, environmental compliance.

  - Voter consensus: Complete procedures (prep, burn, verify, document); safety (fire suppression); link to Clear/Purge; explicit
  Bloom''s objectives.

  - Scaffolding: Balance 5-7 cards per layer (Foundation: defs; Components: NIST framework; Implementation: steps; Integration:
  best practices/policy).

  - Learning objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE].

  - Active learning ties: Tag each card with a discussion/peer/problem-solving link.
