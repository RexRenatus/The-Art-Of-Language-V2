        "core_logic": "Verification is a critical step after degaussing because it confirms that the process was successful and the data is indeed irrecoverable, because degaussers can malfunction or be mismatched to media coercivity. This validation provides assurance that the sanitization objective has been met, as per NIST guidelines on sanitization assurance.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors suggest actions that bypass or are secondary to the essential step of verification: immediate reuse without confirmation, redundant destruction, or simply storage without confirming the sanitization's success.",
        "analogy": "It's like checking if a lock has been properly engaged after locking a door. You don't just assume it's locked; you jiggle the handle to verify. Similarly, after degaussing, you verify the data is gone."
