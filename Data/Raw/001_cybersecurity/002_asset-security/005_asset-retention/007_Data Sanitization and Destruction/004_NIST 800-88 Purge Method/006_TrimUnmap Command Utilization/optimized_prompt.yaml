active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate if TRIM/UNMAP commands alone meet NIST 800-88 purge requirements for confidential data on SSDs
    in virtualized environments. What additional steps (e.g., cryptographic erase, physical destruction) are needed to ensure
    data irrecoverability? Support your reasoning with references to NIST guidelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ from: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''TRIM immediately
    erases data'' vs. ''notifies for GC''); 2) Partial truths (e.g., ''TRIM only for HDDs''); 3) Confusions with related concepts
    (e.g., mix UNMAP with full wipe); 4) Edge cases (e.g., unsupported FS). Ensure distractors are realistic for cybersecurity
    learners.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Asset Security and NIST
  800-88. Generate 25 high-quality Anki-style flashcards on ''Trim/Unmap Command Utilization'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > Asset Security > Asset Retention > Data Sanitization and Destruction > NIST 800-88 Purge Method > Trim/Unmap Command Utilization).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the full list above].

  - Active Learning: Use concepts from discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving to inspire analytical cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards: 6 Layer 1, 6 Layer 2, 7 Layer 3, 6 Layer 4.

  - Balance Bloom''s: 4 Remember/Understand, 8 Apply/Analyze, 8 Evaluate/Create, 5 mixed.

  - Content Sources: NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1/2 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-88r1.pdf),
  SSD specs (ATA TRIM), VMware UNMAP docs (https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.storage.doc/GUID-5883A39C-EE4C-4ECF-BF8C-5C8F2EAAFEF3.html),
  Linux fstrim manpage, Windows fsutil docs. Best Practices: Enable TRIM/UNMAP, verify support, schedule runs, combine with
  other sanitization for compliance.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: 12 Basic (Q/A), 13 MCQ (with distractors). Output as JSON array of objects: [{''type'':
  ''basic|mcq'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''tags'': [''#Layer1'', ''#BloomRemember'', ''#NIST80088''], ''explanation'':
  ''detailed rationale''}].

  Ensure pedagogical best practices: Active recall, spaced repetition friendly, misconceptions addressed, progressive complexity.'
