The primary goal is to replace the original data, making it inaccessible via standard interfaces. While random data might be used, it's not mandated as superior to fixed patterns for this method's purpose.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly assert the superiority of random data, mandate specific patterns, or insist on multi-pass overwrites, contrary to NIST's guidance on the sufficiency of single-pass, patterned overwrites for the 'Clear' method.",
        "analogy": "Using a single pattern to overwrite data is like using a single color of paint to cover an old mural; the original image is gone. Using random data might be like using multiple colors, but the goal of covering the original is achieved with just one."
