active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue for or against using archive snapshots versus standard snapshots for long-term
    compliance in a financial institution. Consider cost, recovery time, and NIST CSF PR.DS-4 implications. What retention
    period would you recommend and why?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    type but wrong consistency), 2) Common errors from research (e.g., assuming all snapshots are geo-redundant), 3) Edge
