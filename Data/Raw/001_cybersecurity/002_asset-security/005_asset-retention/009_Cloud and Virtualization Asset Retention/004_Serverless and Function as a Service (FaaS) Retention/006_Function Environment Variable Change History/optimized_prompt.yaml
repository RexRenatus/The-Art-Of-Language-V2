active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a serverless FaaS environment like AWS Lambda, debate the trade-offs between convenience (e.g., mutable
    environment variables for quick config changes) and security (e.g., retaining full change history for auditing unauthorized
    modifications). Cite specific cybersecurity risks and NIST CSF alignments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Plausible misconceptions: e.g., confuse POSIX naming with Windows vars (allow hyphens); mix FaaS platforms (Lambda
      versioning vs. Azure slots).'
    - 'Common errors: Overstate mutability (env vars are versioned in Lambda); ignore intl risks (claim LC_* harmless).'
    - 'Edge cases: Partial truths (e.g., ''Env vars are always secrets'' – no, but risky if used as such).'
    - 'Balance: 1 syntactic error, 1 conceptual mix-up, 1 overgeneralization.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Asset Security and serverless
  retention. Topic: Function Environment Variable Change History (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Retention
  > Cloud and Virtualization Asset Retention > Serverless and Function as a Service (FaaS) Retention > Function Environment
  Variable Change History). Use provided research: POSIX env vars (environ, name=value, uppercase naming), NIST CSF. Expand
  on voter priorities: intl vars risks (locale attacks), FaaS tracking (AWS Lambda config history/CloudTrail, Azure logs),
  retention policies.


  Prerequisites: Cloud functions basics, asset classification.
