active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between short-term (e.g., 30 days) vs. long-term (e.g.,
    1 year) retention of function execution metrics in serverless environments. How does this impact cost, compliance (e.g.,
    NIST SP 800-53 AU controls), and threat hunting? Provide real-world examples like detecting crypto-mining via anomalous
    CPU metrics.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rate''); 2) Common errors (e.g., wrong NIST SP number); 3) Edge cases (e.g., non-FaaS metric); 4) Real-world misapplications
    (e.g., ignore compliance). Ensure 1-2 distractors are ''almost right'' to promote analysis.'
