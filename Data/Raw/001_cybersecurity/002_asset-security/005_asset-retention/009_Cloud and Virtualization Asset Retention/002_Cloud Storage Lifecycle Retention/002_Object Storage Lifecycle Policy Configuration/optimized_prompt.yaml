active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of implementing aggressive lifecycle policies for cost savings (e.g., rapid transitions
    to cold storage) versus compliance risks (e.g., violating retention periods in regulated industries like finance or healthcare).
    Reference NIST SP 800-53 controls such as RA-3 (Risk Assessment) and MP-6 (Media Sanitization) to support arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    ignore versioning in deletion rules; mix conditions like age vs. size; reverse transition timelines; overlook multipart

  Bloom''s Taxonomy progression, active learning, 4-layer scaffolding.


  **Topic Hierarchy:** Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Retention > Cloud and Virtualization Asset Retention > Cloud
  Storage Lifecycle Retention > Object Storage Lifecycle Policy Configuration.


  **Research Context:** Object storage manages data as objects (data+metadata+ID). OLM automates rules for tier transitions
  (Standard/IA/Glacier), deletions, versioning (retain versions), multipart cleanup. Aligns with NIST SP 800-53 (RA-3, MP-6).
  Providers: AWS S3 (JSON policies), GCP. Best practices: Cost optimization, compliance.


  **Learning Objectives:** [paste array above].


  **Active Learning:** Incorporate elements into scenario flashcards (e.g., debate trade-offs, peer explanations, problem-solving).
  Reference in explanations.


  **Scaffolding:** [paste prior_knowledge, big_picture, concept_map, layers above]. Ensure even coverage: 7-8 cards per layer.


  **Flashcard Generation:** Create exactly 30 flashcards per the schema below. Cover all objectives (5 cards each), layers
  evenly, integrate active learning prompts as scenario questions. Draw from research definitions, examples (AWS/GCP configs),
  NIST. Voter priorities: completeness (include DoD/FedRAMP alignment), pedagogy (progression), peer/problem-solving.


  **Output Schema:** JSON array: [{''id'':1, ''type'':''mcq'', ''bloom_level'':''remember'', ''layer'':1, ''front'':''...'',
  ''back'':{''answer'':''...'', ''explanation'':''...'', ''hints'':[]}, ''tags'':[''lifecycle-rule'']}, ...]. No extra text.'
