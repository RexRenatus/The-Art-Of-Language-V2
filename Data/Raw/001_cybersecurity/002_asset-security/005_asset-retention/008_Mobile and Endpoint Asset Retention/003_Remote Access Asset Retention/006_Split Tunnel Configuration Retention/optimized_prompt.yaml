    tunneling be justified with mitigations? (Addresses misconceptions on performance benefits ignoring risks like data exfiltration).
  peer_teaching: 'In pairs: Student A diagrams split tunneling risks and NIST SP 800-171 Requirement 3.13.7 compliance; Student
    B teaches back configuration retention strategies using examples/non-examples (e.g., AnyConnect full tunnel policy). Switch

    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs based on common misconceptions: 1) Confuse split/full tunneling benefits;
      2) Understate NIST risks (e.g., ''Split is always secure with antivirus''); 3) Mix protocols/tools (e.g., IPsec vs.
      SSL); 4) Ignore retention (e.g., ''One-time config suffices'')'
    - Ensure distractors are 70% correct-sounding but factually wrong, drawn from voter-noted errors like performance myths
      or incomplete compliance

  Core Content (Web Research Summary):

  - Split Tunneling: VPN routes some traffic directly to external networks.

  - Split Tunnel Configuration Retention: Policies to disable/maintain full tunneling on remote devices to prevent exfiltration.

  - NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2, Req 3.13.7: Prevent split tunneling on remote devices.

  - NIST SP 800-77: VPN guidelines favoring full tunnel.
