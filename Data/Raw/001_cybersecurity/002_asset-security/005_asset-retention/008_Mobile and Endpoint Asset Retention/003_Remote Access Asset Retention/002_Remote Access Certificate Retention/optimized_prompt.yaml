  discussion_prompt: In a post-incident forensic investigation, how long should revoked remote access certificates be retained?
    Debate trade-offs between NIST AU-12 audit retention requirements (e.g., 3-12 months minimum, up to 7 years), storage
    costs, and legal holds under regulations like GDPR (up to 10 years for accountability) or HIPAA (6 years for PHI-related
    records). Use compare/contrast with non-retention risks such as impeded investigations or compliance violations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Completed Research Context (Web/NIST-grounded):** Remote Access Certificate Retention involves storing digital certs (PKI-based)
  for remote access (e.g., VPN) post-expiration/revocation for audit, forensics, compliance. NIST SP 800-53 Rev5: AC-17 (Remote
  Access: usage restrictions, auth); AU-11 (Audit Retention: org-defined, min 3 months); AU-12 (Audit Generation/Retention);
  CM-2 (Baseline Config), CM-8 (Inventory). Retention periods: 1-7+ years (NIST flexible; GDPR ~10y accountability; HIPAA
  6y PHI). Revocation: CRL (periodic lists), OCSP (real-time). Sources: NIST SP 800-53r5 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf);
  SP 800-57 Pt1r5 (Key Mgmt: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r5.pdf); RFC 5280 (CRLs).
