active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how GPO application history and logging (via gpresult, Event Viewer, RSoP)
    support cybersecurity auditing for asset retention. Consider scenarios where incomplete history leads to compliance failures
    in endpoint configuration retention.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
