active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether mandatory IoT registration should be enforced organization-wide or risk-based,
    using NIST SP 800-213 risk assessments as evidence. Discuss trade-offs in operational efficiency vs. security, incorporating
    prior knowledge of general IT asset inventory practices.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains the IoT device registration process (using a whiteboard to diagram steps),
    while the partner teaches back inventory retention for OT devices, including key components and relationships to asset
    lifecycle. Switch roles and provide feedback.
  problem_solving: In a real-world scenario, students inventory 10 simulated IoT devices (e.g., smart cameras, sensors in
    a factory). Identify missing registration data, analyze risks (e.g., shadow devices), and propose a retention policy with
    integration to risk management tools.
