  discussion_prompt: In a group of 3-4, debate whether employee personal social media accounts linked to corporate email should
    be classified as Moderate or High sensitivity. Consider potential impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability,
    and vote on a classification with justifications.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Semantic (close synonym/misdefinition), 2) Common error (e.g.,
    confuse NIST with CISSP levels), 3) Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., classify all data as High). Ensure plausibility
    from research context/voter examples; avoid randomness.'

  \ Topic: Asset Sensitivity Classification Levels (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Retention > Asset Lifecycle\
  \ Management > Asset Inventory and Classification > Asset Sensitivity Classification Levels). Use this comprehensive content\
  \ foundation:\n\n**Core Concepts:** Asset (valued resources: hardware, data, software, personnel); Sensitivity (harm potential\
  \ from C/I/A compromise); Classification (assign levels: NIST FIPS 199 Low/Moderate/High; CISSP Public/Internal/Confidential/Restricted).\n\
  **Standards:** NIST SP 800-53/60 (controls by impact), FIPS 199 (impact defs: Low-limited adverse, Moderate-serious, High-severe/catastrophic).\
  \ CISSP: Emphasizes business impact, examples (Low: marketing; Mod: HR; High: financials/PII; Restricted: trade secrets).\n\
  **Process:** 1. Inventory; 2. Assess impact; 3. Classify; 4. Apply controls.\n**Sources:** NIST FIPS 199 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.199);\
  \ SP 800-60 Vol1/2 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/60/v1/r1/final); SP 800-53 Rev5 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final);\
  \ CISSP CBK 9th Ed. (ISC2, 2021); ISO 27001 Annex A.8.\n\nIncorporate these pedagogical elements:\n- Learning Objectives:\
  \ [INSERT FULL LIST FROM JSON]\n- Scaffolding: Generate flashcards grouped by 4 layers: Foundation (Layer1 basics), Components\
  \ (Layer2 standards), Implementation (Layer3 steps/examples), Integration (Layer4 connections/risk).\n- Active Learning\
  \ Hooks: End each back with a mini-prompt from activities (e.g., 'Debate: Classify social media accounts?').\n\nGenerate\
  \ 40-50 high-quality flashcards following this exact schema per card:\n{\n  \"type\": \"MCQ|Cloze|ShortAnswer\",\n  \"layer\"\

  \ 20% cloze, rest varied. Ensure voter priorities: examples (healthcare/retail), completeness (CISSP/NIST details), SMART\
  \ objectives. Output as JSON array of flashcards, grouped by layer."
