active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between automated patch deployment (e.g., using WSUS or
    SCCM) versus manual testing in a critical infrastructure environment. Consider factors like speed, risk, and compliance
    with NIST SP 800-40. Each participant must cite one pro and one con, supported by real-world breach examples (e.g., WannaCry).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    patches''); (2) Confused stage (e.g., mix Track with Deploy); (3) Outdated/irrelevant framework (e.g., pre-Rev.4 NIST).
    Ensure distractors are realistic, derived from research context or voter suggestions, and teachable moments in explanations.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards on ''Patch Management Lifecycle''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Retention > Asset Lifecycle Management > Asset Maintenance and
  Sustainment > Patch Management Lifecycle). Voter consensus (70% approval): Emphasize full NIST SP 800-40 Rev. 4 stages:
  1. Track, 2. Acquire, 3. Test, 4. Deploy, 5. Verify, 6. Monitor/Report.
