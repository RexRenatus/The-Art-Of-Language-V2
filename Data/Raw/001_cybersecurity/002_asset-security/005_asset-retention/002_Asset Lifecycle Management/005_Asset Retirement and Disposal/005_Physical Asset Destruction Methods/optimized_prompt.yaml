active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of physical destruction methods (e.g., shredding vs. incineration)
    in terms of cost, environmental impact, security effectiveness, and scalability for enterprise asset retirement. Reference
    NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 2 and provide evidence for your position.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    vs. Purge), 2) Similar but incorrect method (e.g., ''Clearing'' for high-security), 3) Media mismatch (e.g., ''Incineration
    unsuitable for tapes due to residue''). Base on NIST variances, pros/cons, or truncated content errors. Ensure distractors
    teach via explanation.'

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL 4 LAYERS FROM ABOVE]

  - Research Context: NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 2 (Clear/Purge/Destroy; Destroy methods: shredding, pulverizing, incineration, disintegration,
  chemical; media-specific like HDD <2mm², SSD finer; pros/cons tables).


  Ensure flashcards progress through scaffolding layers and Bloom''s levels. Use distractor protocol strictly.


  Output as JSON array: [{''id'':1, ''front'':''...'', ''back'':{''answer'':''...'', ''explanation'':''...'', ''reference'':''...'',

  Cover all methods comprehensively, link to prior knowledge (asset lifecycle), and emphasize completion of physical methods
  (no truncations).'
