active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the risks of retaining legacy systems (e.g., increased attack surface,
    compliance violations) versus decommissioning costs, and propose how a decision framework could balance these factors.
    Reference NIST SP 800-88 methods to support arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate high-quality, optimized flashcards using the provided pedagogical structure. Base content on:

  - Research: NIST SP 800-88r2 (Clear: logical sanitize user-addressable storage; Purge: make recovery infeasible w/o destroying
  usability; Destroy: render media unusable, e.g., shred/demagnetize). NIST SP 800-37 RMF for lifecycle. Objectives: data
  security, risk reduction, efficiency, compliance. Decision Framework steps: Assess (value/risks), Classify data, Select
  NIST method, Verify, Document.

  - Voter consensus: Completeness (full NIST details, sources: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-88r1.pdf,
  https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/37/r2/final); pedagogy (Bloom''s progression); scaffolding (4 layers); integration (prereqs:
  asset inventory/classification).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the array above].

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to activities (e.g., scenario Qs for problem-solving).

  - Scaffolding: [paste the array above] – ensure coverage.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: [paste schema above]. Output ONLY the JSON array of flashcards (30-50 total). Ensure measurable,
  active recall; distractors from misconceptions; progression from foundation to integration. No additional text.'
