active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between short-term configuration retention (e.g., 30 days
    for cost savings) versus long-term retention (e.g., 1 year for forensic analysis) in a multi-cloud environment. Use NIST
    SP 800-128 and AWS Config examples to support your arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - 'Frequency: 60% MCQ with distractors, 20% cloze, 20% open-ended.'
  - 'Balance: Even coverage across Bloom''s levels and scaffolding layers (aim 10-15 cards per layer).'

  **Context & Research (Complete):** Cloud config retention manages/stores config data for security, incident response, audits.
  Core concepts: CM, Baseline Config, CI, Config Drift, SecCM (NIST SP 800-128: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-128.pdf).
  Cloud examples: AWS Config (snapshots/history 30-2555 days: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/config-concepts.html),
  Azure Policy (history retention), GCP Asset Inventory. Sources: NIST SP 800-128, CIS Benchmarks, AWS/Azure docs.


  **Pedagogy:** Align to these objectives [insert learning_objectives array]. Use scaffolding layers [insert scaffolding array].
  Reference active learning for realism.


  **Generation Rules:**

  - Cover all Bloom''s levels and 4 scaffolding layers evenly.

  - 50% basic recall (Layers 1-2), 50% higher-order (Layers 3-4).

  - Follow exact schema [insert flashcard_schema.structure].

  - Distractors per protocol [insert flashcard_schema.distractor_protocol].

  - Ensure measurable, active verbs; web-grounded (cite sources).

  - Output as JSON array of objects.
