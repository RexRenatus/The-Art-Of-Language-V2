active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss how inadequate routing and switching configuration retention contributed to real-world breaches
    (e.g., Equifax or SolarWinds). What preventive measures from NIST SP 800-128 could have mitigated these, and how would
    you implement them in your organization's network?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ
    - 'Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., TFTP is secure vs. actually insecure)'
    - 'Distractor 2: Partial truth/mix-up (e.g., confuse ''show running-config'' with ''show startup-config'')'
    - 'Distractor 3: Extreme or outdated practice (e.g., manual backups only vs. automated)'
    - Ensure distractors teach via error (explanation debunks them)
    count: Aim for 60% MCQ, 20% cloze, 20% short answer
