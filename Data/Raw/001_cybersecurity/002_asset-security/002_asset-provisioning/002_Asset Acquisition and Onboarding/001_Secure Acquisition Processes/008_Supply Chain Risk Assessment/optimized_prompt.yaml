  **Comprehensive Research Context:** [INSERT FULL COMPLETED SUMMARY BELOW]


  A supply chain risk assessment (SCRA) is a critical process for identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in supplier networks
  impacting cybersecurity. Core Concepts: Supply Chain (full lifecycle network); Supply Chain Risk (disruptions/threats);
  C-SCRM (systematic cyber risk mgmt for ICT); SCRA (risk eval for tech products); TPRM (broader external risks; C-SCRM is
  ICT-focused subset).


  Frameworks: NIST CSF 2.0 GV.SC (Govern: SCRM strategy/policies); NIST SP 800-161 Rev. 1 (C-SCRM practices: lifecycle processes—plan,
  assess risks, onboard, monitor, respond/recover); ISO 28000 (supply chain security mgmt systems); CISA (ICT guidelines,
  JCDC for vendor collab).


  Best Practices: 1) Map suppliers; 2) Risk assess (cyber, geo-political); 3) Due diligence (audits/SBOMS); 4) Mitigate (SLAs/contracts);
  5) Continuous monitoring. Example: SolarWinds (2020)—nth-party compromise via build system.


  Sources: NIST CSF 2.0, NIST SP 800-161r1, ISO 28000, CISA.gov/SCRM, CNSS 4016.
