  discussion_prompt: 'Using the Azure Security Benchmark (AM-1: Track asset inventory, AM-2: Approved services, AM-3: Secure
    transfer, AM-4: Resource access, AM-5: Approved apps on VMs), debate whether strict adherence to approved services and
    applications hinders innovation in fast-paced DevOps environments or is essential for security. Cite real-world examples
    like the Capital One breach due to misconfigurations.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
