active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss the trade-offs of different dependency managers (e.g., npm vs. Maven) in terms of security features,
    transitive dependency management, and response to real-world vulnerabilities like Log4Shell. How does each contribute
    to asset security in the software supply chain?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    direct/transitive deps; 2) Mix SBOM/VEX roles; 3) Wrong tool usage (e.g., npm audit as SBOM gen); 4) Oversimplify supply
    chain risks. Ensure distractors are realistic from voter suggestions/web context (e.g., ''Log4Shell was direct dep only'').'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Asset Security. Topic:
  Software Dependency Resolution (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Provisioning > Asset Acquisition and Onboarding
  > Software Installation and Deployment > Software Dependency Resolution). Use the provided learning objectives (spanning
  Bloom''s: Remember to Create), active learning activities, 4 scaffolding layers, and flashcard schema to generate 25 high-quality
  flashcards.


  Incorporate: Voter consensus (SBOM/SPDX/CycloneDX details, tools: npm audit/Snyk/OWASP Dependency-Check/Dependabot, Log4Shell
  example, concept map, CI/CD integration); Web context (definitions: dependency, supply chain, SBOM, VEX, transitive deps,
  standards); Prior knowledge link to Software Installation.


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards, each: {''front'': ''Question text (MCQ or cloze)'', ''back'': ''Answer + full
  explanation per schema'', ''bloom_level'': ''e.g., Analyze'', ''scaffolding_layer'': 2, ''type'': ''MCQ/Cloze/Short Answer''}.


  Balance: 30% Layer 1/Remember-Understand, 30% Layer 2-3/Apply-Analyze, 40% Layer 4/Evaluate-Create. Ensure active recall,
  no hints on front. Use distractor protocol strictly.'
