  discussion_prompt: 'In the context of cyber supply chain risk management (C-SCRM), debate the limitations of physical security
    seals like those described in ASTM F1158 (https://www.astm.org/f1158-23.html). Are they sufficient against sophisticated
    tampering techniques (e.g., resealable adhesives or supply chain insertions), or should they be combined with digital
    integrity checks from NIST SP 1800-34v1 ''IT Asset Management: Financial Services – Validating the Integrity of Servers
    and Client Devices'' (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1800-34v1.pdf)? Provide examples of
    real-world breaches where seals failed (e.g., SolarWinds supply chain attack parallels).'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Core Content (Research Summary):** [Insert full research context here: Core Concepts (tampering, seals, verification,
  integrity, provenance, C-SCRM); Standards (ASTM F1158: https://www.astm.org/f1158-23.html - inspection/evaluation guide;
  NIST SP 1800-34v1: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1800-34v1.pdf - validating integrity of
  servers/clients via roots of trust); Types (adhesive/wire/electronic); Steps (visual exam, reapplication tests); Integration
  (C-SCRM, RFID/blockchain).]


  **Learning Objectives:** [List all 6 from above].

  **Scaffolding:** Use 4 layers + concept map [insert full scaffolding]. Balance flashcards: 25% Layer1, 25% Layer2, 25% Layer3,
  25% Layer4; span all Bloom''s.

  **Active Learning Integration:** Flashcards should prompt recall linking to activities (e.g., ''How does this relate to
  the compromised seal scenario?'').

  **Prior Knowledge:** Tie to asset acquisition/chain of custody.


  Generate exactly 25-30 flashcards using the EXACT schema: [insert full flashcard_schema]. Ensure active recall, spaced repetition
  best practices (concise fronts, detailed backs). Cover misconceptions (e.g., seals foolproof). Output ONLY a JSON array
  of flashcard objects, no extra text.'
