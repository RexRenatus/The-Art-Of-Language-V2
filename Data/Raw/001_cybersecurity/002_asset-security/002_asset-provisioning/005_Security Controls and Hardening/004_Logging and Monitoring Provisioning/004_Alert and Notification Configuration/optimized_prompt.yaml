active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a resource-constrained environment, debate the optimal balance between alert volume and response time,
    referencing NIST SP 800-53 SI-4(5) and IR-6. What strategies (e.g., tuning thresholds, machine learning anomaly detection)
    best mitigate alert fatigue? Support with real-world examples from SIEM deployments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    flag potential events''); 2) Partial truths (e.g., ''Email only'' vs. ''Multi-channel''); 3) Framework misrefs (e.g.,
    ''AU-6 for notifications'' vs. ''SI-4(5)''); 4) Edge cases (e.g., ignore false positives). Ensure 70% plausible to test
    deep understanding.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Anki-compatible MCQs with
  pedagogical depth. Topic: Alert and Notification Configuration (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Provisioning
  > Security Controls and Hardening > Logging and Monitoring Provisioning > Alert and Notification Configuration). Use provided
  learning objectives, active learning activities, scaffolding layers, and flashcard schema EXACTLY.


  Incorporate: NIST CSF Detect/Respond (DE.CM, RS.CO), SP 800-53 SI-4(5)/IR-6 (NOT AU-6/7 for alerts), ISO/IEC 27001 Annex
  A.5.24–A.5.27. Address misconceptions (alerts≠incidents, notifications≠alerts, fatigue risks). Prerequisites: Logging basics.


  Generate 50 flashcards spanning Bloom''s levels (use objectives as basis). Balance: 20% Layer 1-2 (recall/understand), 40%
  Layer 3 (apply/analyze), 40% Layer 4 (evaluate/create). Include scenario-based for higher levels tying to active learning
  (e.g., cloud IDS false positives, SOC debate).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of objects, each matching schema: {''question'': str, ''correct_answer'': str, ''distractors'':
  [str,str,str], ''explanation'': str (with refs/active tie-in), ''bloom_level'': str, ''layer'': ''1|2|3|4'', ''type'': ''basic|scenario''}.


  Ensure accuracy, engagement, and distractor quality per protocol. No extra text.'
