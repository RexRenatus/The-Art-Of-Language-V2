active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains the TLS handshake process (ClientHello to key exchange) to their partner using
    drawings; partner teaches back cipher suite selection. Switch roles to address misconceptions like assuming all ciphers
    are equal.
  problem_solving: 'Provide students with a vulnerable server config (e.g., supports SSL 3.0, weak RC4 cipher). Using tools
    like OpenSSL or Qualys SSL Labs, reconfigure to NIST-compliant TLS 1.3-only setup. Real-world app: Secure a mock e-commerce
    site.'

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (20 basic Q&A, 15 cloze deletions, 15 MCQ) optimized for Anki/Spaced Repetition. Cover
  all 4 scaffolding layers progressively (Layer 1: 20%, Layer 2: 25%, Layer 3: 30%, Layer 4: 25%). Align to these Bloom''s
  Taxonomy objectives:

  1. REMEMBER: Define TLS and list core properties.

  2. UNDERSTAND: Explain handshake.

  3. APPLY: Implement config.

  4. ANALYZE: Identify vulnerabilities.

  5. EVALUATE: Assess NIST compliance.

  6. CREATE: Design policy.


  Incorporate active learning: Embed prompts referencing discussion (TLS 1.2 vs 1.3 debate), peer teaching (handshake drawings),
  problem-solving (fix vulnerable config).


  Key content from research/NIST: TLS/SSL definitions, handshake, cipher suites (prefer ECDHE, AESGCM; disable RC4, SSL3),
  PKI/certificates, NIST SP 800-52r2 (profiles, compliance), NIST SP 1800-16 (TLS cert mgmt, best practices like OCSP stapling,
  HSTS), TLS 1.3 optimizations, tools (OpenSSL, SSL Labs).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards matching this schema:

  {''type'': ''basic''|''cloze''|''mcq'', ''front'': str, ''back'': str, ''explanation'': str, ''tags'': [str], ''distractors'':
  [str] (MCQ only)}.


  Ensure variety: Basic for remember/understand, cloze for apply/analyze, MCQ for evaluate/create. Distractors: 3 plausible
  based on misconceptions (e.g., legacy protocols). Explanations: Cite sources, link to objectives/layers/active learning.'
