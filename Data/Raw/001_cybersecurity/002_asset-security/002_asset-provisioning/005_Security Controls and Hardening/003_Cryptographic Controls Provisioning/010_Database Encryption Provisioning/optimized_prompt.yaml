active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between performance impact and security benefits of Transparent Data Encryption
    (TDE) versus application-level encryption in databases, considering real-world scenarios like high-traffic e-commerce
    sites.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains symmetric vs. asymmetric encryption and the role of HSMs in key management
    to their partner, who then summarizes and provides an example; switch roles and discuss integration with databases.
  problem_solving: Design an encryption provisioning plan for AWS RDS compliant with NIST SP 800-57, including algorithm selection,
    key generation/rotation, TDE configuration, and testing for data at rest protection; present and peer-review solutions.

    speed), (2) Edge case reversal (e.g., swap TDE/app-level benefits), (3) Related but incorrect term (e.g., ''data in transit''
    for ''data at rest''). Ensure distractors are realistic based on research context.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Database Encryption Provisioning
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Provisioning > Security Controls and Hardening > Cryptographic
  Controls Provisioning > Database Encryption Provisioning). Use the provided research context, voter suggestions, and pedagogical
  elements to create optimized flashcards.


  **Core Content Sources:** NIST SP 800-57 (Key Management), SP 800-111 (Storage Encryption), CIS Database Benchmarks; techniques:
  TDE, field-level encryption, envelope encryption, HSMs; best practices: key rotation, cloud (AWS RDS) provisioning; case
  studies: Equifax breach.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives above].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** Generate flashcards proportionally (25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 30% Layer 3, 20% Layer 4). [Insert
  full scaffolding descriptions].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Infuse flashcards with hooks to activities, e.g., ''Apply to debate: TDE vs. app-level
  trade-offs.''


  **Flashcard Generation Rules:**

  - Cover all core concepts: data at rest, symmetric/asymmetric/envelope encryption, keys, TDE, HSM, provisioning steps, standards.

  - Balance Bloom''s: 30% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 30% APPLY/ANALYZE, 40% EVALUATE/CREATE.

  - Use schema exactly: Basic Q&A and MCQs with distractor protocol.

  - Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''Q&A'' or ''MCQ'', ''layer'': ''1-4'', ''blooms_level'': ''REMEMBER'', ''hierarchy'':
  ''Level 6'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...''}].

  - Ensure university-level rigor: precise, measurable, active recall-focused.
