  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, Student A explains offsite backup configurations per NIST SP 800-53 CP-2 (Contingency Plan), including
    encryption and testing; Student B teach-backs the 3-2-1 rule with a custom example. Switch roles and provide feedback.
  problem_solving: For a fictional company facing ransomware threats, design an offsite backup plan meeting RPO of 1 hour
    and RTO of 24 hours using CIS Controls and hybrid cloud (e.g., on-prem to AWS Glacier). Present solutions and peer-review
    for completeness.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create plausible distractors from: 1. Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Cloud storage alone meets 3-2-1
    without onsite copies'', ''No encryption needed offsite''); 2. Partial truths (e.g., ''2 copies total'' vs. 3); 3. Confusions
    (e.g., mix RTO/RPO definitions); 4. Edge cases (e.g., cloud-only vs. hybrid). Ensure 1-2 distractors per MC are highly
    plausible to promote active recall.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Asset Security (Offsite
  Backup Configuration). Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding. Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > Asset Security > Asset Provisioning > Security Controls and Hardening > Backup and Recovery Provisioning > Offsite Backup
  Configuration.


  Research Context: Offsite backup = data copy at separate location for DR. Key: 3-2-1 Rule (3 copies, 2 media, 1 offsite);
  RTO (max downtime), RPO (max data loss); NIST SP 800-53 CP-2 (Contingency Plan); CIS Control 11. Cloud Frameworks: AWS (S3/Backup/Glacier
  with immutability), Azure (Backup Vault, Site Recovery), Google Cloud (Cloud Storage Archive). Best Practices: Encrypt,
  test restores, immutable storage vs ransomware. Misconceptions: Onsite suffices, no geo-redundancy needed. Sources: NIST
  SP 800-53 Rev5, 2brightsparks.com/3-2-1, CISecurity.org/controls, AWS/Azure docs.
