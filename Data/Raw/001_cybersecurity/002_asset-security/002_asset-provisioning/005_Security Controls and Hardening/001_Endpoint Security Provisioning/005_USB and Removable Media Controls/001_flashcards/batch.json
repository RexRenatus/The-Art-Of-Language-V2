          "text": "Return the device to the manufacturer without any data removal.",

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "NIST SP 800-124 emphasizes that mobile devices, like other media, must be properly sanitized before disposal or transfer to prevent sensitive data from being recovered. This aligns with broader asset security principles for data lifecycle management.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors suggest disposal methods that fail to adequately protect data, ranging from no data removal to insufficient sanitization techniques.",
        "analogy": "Disposing of a mobile device without sanitization is like leaving your personal diary on a park bench for anyone to find."
