        "core_logic": "Separation of Duties is a control that divides critical tasks among multiple individuals, preventing any single person from having end-to-end control. This is crucial for preventing privilege escalation because it requires an attacker to compromise multiple accounts or roles to achieve a malicious objective, thereby increasing the difficulty and risk of detection.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors describe other important security controls (patching, strong passwords, encryption) but none directly address the principle of dividing critical responsibilities to prevent a single point of failure or abuse of privilege.",

        "core_logic": "A Privileged Access Workstation (PAW) provides a dedicated, secure environment for administrative tasks, isolating them from the risks of everyday computing like malware or phishing. This isolation is critical because it significantly reduces the attack surface available to attackers targeting privileged accounts, making escalation much harder.",
