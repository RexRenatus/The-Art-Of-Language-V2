active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using behavioral biometrics (e.g., keystroke dynamics)
    versus physiological biometrics (e.g., fingerprints) for enrollment in high-stakes environments like banking. Reference
    NIST IAL requirements and privacy risks to support your position.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
