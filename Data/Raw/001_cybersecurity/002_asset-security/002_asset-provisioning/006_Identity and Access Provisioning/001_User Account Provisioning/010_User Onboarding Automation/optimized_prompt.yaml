active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs between achieving high Identity Assurance Levels (IAL) and operational efficiency
    in automated user onboarding. In what scenarios would you prioritize IAL2 over IAL1 (e.g., high-risk finance roles), and
    what automation tools (e.g., biometric scanners, API integrations) could mitigate associated delays? Debate security vs.
    speed in small groups.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''User Onboarding Automation''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Provisioning > Identity and Access Provisioning > User Account
  Provisioning > User Onboarding Automation). Generate 25-35 high-quality flashcards optimized for spaced repetition (Anki-style),
  covering all Bloom''s levels and scaffolding layers.


  **Incorporate:**

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the array above verbatim].

  - Active Learning: Tie cards to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving where relevant.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards: 30% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 20% Layer 4.

  - Concept Map: Ensure cards reflect dependencies (e.g., proofing → enrollment).

  - Sources: NIST SP 800-63 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63-3), 800-63A/B/C links.


  **Follow Flashcard Schema exactly:** [paste schema verbatim]. Use variety: 40% MCQ, 30% Definition, 20% Cloze/Process, 10%
  Application. Ensure coverage of NIST parts, assurance levels, IdP/CSP/RP, workflows.
