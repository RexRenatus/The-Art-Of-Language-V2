active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a resource-limited organization, debate the trade-offs of implementing real-time configuration monitoring
    versus scheduled scans. Consider factors like cost, detection latency, scalability, and false positive rates. Support
    your position with NIST SP 800-128 guidelines and real-world examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
  additional_activities:
  - 'Think-Pair-Share: Discuss misconceptions (e.g., ''Does real-time monitoring catch all vulnerabilities instantly? Why/why
    not?'').'
  - 'Role-playing: Act as SOC analysts responding to a config drift alert in a simulated environment.'
  - 'Group simulation: Build a mock baseline and monitor changes in a virtual lab using tools like Ansible or Puppet.'

    rules:
    - '3 distractors per MCQ: 1 plausible misconception (e.g., confuse CM with SecCM), 1 overly broad/general, 1 irrelevant/off-topic.'
    - Base on voter-noted misconceptions (e.g., real-time catches all instantly; baselines are static).
    - 'Ensure distractors teach: Explain in back why wrong (e.g., ''Distractor A confuses scheduled scans with real-time'').'
    - 'Variety: 60% MCQ, 20% cloze, 20% short answer for higher Bloom''s.'
    generation_count: 'Generate 40-60 flashcards: 10 per Bloom''s level/objective, balanced across scaffolding layers.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy\
  \ (Bloom's Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic 'Real-Time Configuration\
  \ Monitoring' in Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Provisioning > Configuration and Baseline Management > Configuration\
  \ Monitoring and Compliance > Real-Time Configuration Monitoring.\n\nIncorporate:\n- Learning Objectives: [paste the learning_objectives\
  \ array here]\n- Active Learning: [reference activities for links in explanations]\n- Scaffolding: Use the 4 layers [paste\
  \ scaffolding content] to ensure progressive coverage.\n- Voter Consensus: 100% approval; emphasize NIST SP 800-128 full\
  \ phases, prior knowledge links, big picture (NIST RMF), trade-offs.\n- Sources: NIST SP 800-128 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-128.pdf),\
  \ NIST SP 800-53 (CA-7), OSSEC/AWS Config docs.\n\nOutput 50 flashcards in JSON array format, each following this exact\

  - Coverage: Even distribution across objectives/layers/Bloom's.\n- Distractors: Follow protocol (misconceptions like 'real-time\
  \ = instant all vulns').\n- Pedagogy: Questions scaffold from recall to creation; explanations promote active recall/metacognition.\n\
  - Engagement: Tie to real-world (e.g., breaches from drift).\n\nGenerate now."
