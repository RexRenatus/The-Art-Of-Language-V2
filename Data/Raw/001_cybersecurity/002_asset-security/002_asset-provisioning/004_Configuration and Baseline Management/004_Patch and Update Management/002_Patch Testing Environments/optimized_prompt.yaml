  discussion_prompt: 'Discuss the trade-offs between rapid patching for zero-day vulnerabilities and thorough testing in isolated
    environments. Use the WannaCry ransomware attack as a real-world example: What risks were highlighted, and how could a
    robust patch testing environment have mitigated them? (Encourage critical thinking by requiring students to cite NIST
    frameworks and propose balanced strategies.)'

  **Research Context (Complete):** Patch testing environments are isolated mirrors of production for evaluating patches to
  fix vulnerabilities, prevent issues like conflicts or regressions. Core concepts: Patching (software fixes), Patch Testing
  Env (virtualized, snapshot-enabled), Production Env (live ops), Vulnerability Mgmt (ID/assess/remediate), Cyber Hygiene
  (basics like patching). NIST Guidance: SP 1800-31 ''Improving Enterprise Patching'' (volumes A/B/C: tools/processes for
  testing); SP 1800-31B details testing workflows, automation; SP 800-40 Rev. 4 (patch mgmt guide); SP 800-53 (CM-4: impact
  analysis/testing; SI-2: flaw remediation). Real-world: WannaCry exploited unpatched SMBv1. Components: Virtualization (VMware/VirtualBox/Docker),
  snapshots, scripts. Phased testing: unit/integration/UAT. Sources: [NIST SP 1800-31](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/1800/31),
  [SP 1800-31B](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/1800/31/b), [SP 800-40](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/40/r4/final), [SP
  800-53](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final).


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Synthesize flashcards per scaffolding layers (Foundation: defs; Components: elements; Implementation:
  steps; Integration: automation/NIST). Align to Bloom''s objectives: [insert learning_objectives array here]. Incorporate
  active learning hooks in explanations (e.g., ''Discuss in groups: ...''). Prior knowledge: Link to basic patching/vuln mgmt.


  **Generate 25 flashcards** following EXACT schema: [{question, answer, bloom_level, explanation, distractors: [{text, explanation},
  ...x3]}]. Balance Bloom''s levels. Distractors: exactly 3, plausible, with educational explanations. Output ONLY valid JSON
  array. Ensure completeness, engagement, and schema compliance.'
