  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the limitations of relying solely on CVSS scores for patch prioritization
    (e.g., it measures intrinsic severity but ignores real-world exploit likelihood). How does EPSS complement CVSS? Use the
    real-world example of Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228: CVSS 10.0, high EPSS) to support your arguments, and reference common
    misconceptions like overlooking asset criticality.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: (1) Common misconception (e.g., ''CVSS measures exploit probability''
    instead of severity); (2) Close value/error (e.g., CVSS 9.8 as 7.5); (3) Confused term (e.g., EPSS score as 10-scale).
    Ensure plausible for analysis-level errors. For non-MCQ, suggest distractor ideas in explanation.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom''s Taxonomy, active
  learning, and scaffolding. Topic: Patch Assessment and Prioritization (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset
  Provisioning > Configuration and Baseline Management > Patch and Update Management > Patch Assessment and Prioritization).
  Use the provided learning_objectives, active_learning components, scaffolding layers (4 progressive: Foundation to Integration),
  and flashcard_schema exactly.


  Context: Incorporate voter consensus (100% approval): EPSS full desc (''probability 0-1 of exploit in wild within 30 days'');
  real-world CVE (Log4Shell CVE-2021-44228, CVSS 10.0); common misconceptions (over-rely CVSS sans criticality/EPSS); prereqs
  (vulns from Vulnerability Mgmt, baselines from Patch Mgmt); NIST SP 800-40 Rev. 4 (nist.gov); CVSS (first.org/cvss); EPSS
  (first.org/epss). Concept map: Hierarchical as in scaffolding.


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards (5 per Bloom level) covering all objectives/layers. Ensure variety: 40% MCQ (w/ distractors),
  30% cloze/process, 20% scenario apply, 10% creation prompts. Balance layers (Layer1: 20%, Layer2: 30%, etc.). Promote active
  recall/spaced repetition.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each matching flashcard_schema precisely. No extra text.'
