        "core_logic": "CE is highly efficient because it sanitizes data by erasing encryption keys, which is much faster than overwriting entire storage media, therefore allowing for rapid reuse of the ISM. This works by making the ciphertext inaccessible without the keys.",

        "analogy": "CE is like instantly deleting the password to a locked vault – the vault (media) is still there, but the contents are inaccessible without the deleted password."
