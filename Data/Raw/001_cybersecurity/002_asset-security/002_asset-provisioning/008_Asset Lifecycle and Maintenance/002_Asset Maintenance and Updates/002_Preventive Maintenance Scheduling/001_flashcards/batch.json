        "core_logic": "Antivirus software, while common in IT, can interfere with the real-time, performance-critical operations of OT systems. Therefore, implementation requires careful compatibility checks, thorough testing for performance impacts, and potentially using vendor-recommended solutions to avoid disrupting safety and operations.",

        "analogy": "Implementing antivirus on OT systems is like installing a security guard in a sensitive laboratory: you need to ensure the guard doesn't accidentally disrupt delicate experiments or compromise safety protocols."
