active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the implications of extending the use of EOL software beyond its EOSL date
    in a healthcare organization. Consider trade-offs between cost savings and risks like unpatched vulnerabilities leading
    to ransomware. Propose three mitigation strategies and vote on the most effective one.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''EOL means automatic upgrades'');
    2) Related but incorrect standard (e.g., NIST 800-53 vs. 800-88); 3) Extreme/overly safe option (e.g., ''Always Destroy
    everything''). Ensure distractors test subtle understanding.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Asset Security. Generate
  75 high-quality Anki-style flashcards for the topic ''End-of-Life Planning'' (corrected hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset
  Security > Asset Lifecycle and Maintenance > Asset Maintenance and Updates > End-of-Life Planning). Builds on prior knowledge:
  asset inventory, data classification, maintenance schedules.


  **Research Context (Completed):** EOL planning ensures secure decommissioning to mitigate breaches. Key NIST docs: SP 800-37
  Rev 2 (RMF: Disposal in SDLC); SP 800-88 Rev 1 (Sanitization: Clear-overwrite; Purge-degauss/encrypt; Destroy-shred); SP
  1800-28 (Data Confidentiality in EOL Devices, emphasizing secure disposal workflows). Risks: Unpatched vulns, data leaks.
  Compliance: GDPR Art. 32, HIPAA. Sources: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SP/800/88r1.pdf; https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SP/800/37/rev2/sp800-37r2.pdf;

  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the 6 objectives above].

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers (10-20 per layer).

  - Active Learning: Embed hints linking to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving.

  - Assessments: Include MCQs like ''NIST SP for sanitization? B) 800-88''; T/F ''Data sanitization optional? False - NIST
  800-88 mandates per risk.''
