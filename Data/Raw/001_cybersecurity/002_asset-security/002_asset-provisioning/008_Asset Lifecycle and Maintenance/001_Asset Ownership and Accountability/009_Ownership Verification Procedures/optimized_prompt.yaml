active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a rapidly scaling organization, should asset ownership be tied to individuals or functional roles?
    Compare the risks and benefits using NIST SP 800-53 controls like CM-8 (System Component Inventory) and PM-5 (System Inventory)
    as evidence, considering real-world incidents like supply chain attacks. Debate how this impacts asset lifecycle accountability.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    generation_rules: Distractors must be plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse CM-8 with PM-5; overlook
      verification steps; mix individual vs. role ownership); derive from research context/voter suggestions; avoid obvious
      errors; explain why each is wrong in 'explanation' field.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator synthesizing university-level pedagogy for ''Ownership Verification
  Procedures'' (Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Provisioning > Asset Lifecycle and Maintenance > Asset Ownership and
  Accountability > Ownership Verification Procedures). Generate 25 high-quality flashcards optimized for active recall, spaced
  repetition, and Bloom''s Taxonomy progression.


  **Incorporate these exactly:**

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the full array from ''learning_objectives'']

  - Active Learning Tie-Ins: Reference discussion (individual vs. role ownership), peer teaching (NIST CM-8), problem-solving
  (cloud scenario) in explanations where relevant.

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste descriptions from ''scaffolding_layers'']; distribute flashcards: 6 Layer 1, 6 Layer 2, 7 Layer
  3, 6 Layer 4.

  - Prior Knowledge: Link to asset identification/classification.

  - Sources: NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (CM-8 System Component Inventory, PM-5, SA-4), NIST SP 800-171 (3.4.2 Configuration Management),
  ISO 27001 (A.8.1.1 Inventory of Assets). URLs: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final, https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/171/r3/final,
  https://www.iso.org/standard/27001.

  - Big Picture: Emphasize contributions to incident response, compliance, maturity.


  **Output Format:** JSON array of objects, strictly adhering to this schema: [{ "front": "...", "back": { "answer": "...",
  "explanation": "...", "reference": "...", "related_objective": "...", "related_layer": "..." }, "type": "...", "bloom_level":
  "..." }]


  **Flashcard Rules:**

  - Use ''flashcard_schema'' structure precisely.

  - MCQs: Follow distractor protocol (plausible, misconception-based).

  - Balance: Cover all objectives/layers; vary types.

  - Pedagogy: Scaffold from simple recall to creation; include active elements in explanations.

  - Voter Consensus: Address all priorities (e.g., NIST 800-171 completion, discussion debate).
