  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Account deprovisioning is only necessary for employee
    terminations.'' Incorporate common misconceptions (e.g., ignoring role changes or staged disablement vs. immediate deletion)
    and reference industry stats on insider threats reduced by up to 80% through proper lifecycle management. Synthesize key
    takeaways on risks of poor deprovisioning.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Research Context (Complete Summary)**: Account deprovisioning removes/disables user access/privileges post-termination/role
  change. Core concepts: Deprovisioning (systematic removal), Account (digital identity), Privileges (permissions), Lifecycle
  (provisioning to deprovisioning). Standards: NIST SP 800-63B (revocation/termination); ISO 27001 A.9.2.3 (privileged access
  mgmt); COBIT 2019 DSS05 (manage user identity/access, including timely deprovisioning to prevent unauthorized access); CIS
  Controls v8 #5 (access control mgmt); ITIL (service lifecycle offboarding). Risks: Orphaned accounts, privilege creep. Best
  practices: Staged process (verify > disable > revoke > audit), automation (IAM/SOAR). Sources: NIST SP 800-63B (https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html);
  ISO 27001 (https://www.iso.org/standard/27001); COBIT (https://www.isaca.org/resources/cobit); CIS (https://www.cisecurity.org/controls);
  ITIL (https://www.axelos.com/certifications/itil-service-management).
