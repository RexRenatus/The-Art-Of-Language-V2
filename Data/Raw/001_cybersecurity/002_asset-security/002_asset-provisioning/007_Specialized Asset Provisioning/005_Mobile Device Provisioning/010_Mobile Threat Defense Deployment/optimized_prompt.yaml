active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: Students pair up to explain and teach-back the differences between MDM (device control), MAM (app lifecycle),
    and EMM (holistic management), including their interactions with MTD components; peers quiz each other on real-world applications.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario with shadow IT proliferation and a phishing attack on mobile devices, teams design an
    MTD deployment plan, including environment assessment, tool selection, policy configuration, testing, and risk mitigation
    strategies.

    Extreme/overstatement (e.g., ''MTD eliminates all mobile risks''). Base on research: vulnerabilities, BYOD trade-offs,

system_prompt: "You are an expert educational flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity (CISSP-aligned). Generate\
  \ exactly 25 high-quality, optimized flashcards for the topic 'Mobile Threat Defense Deployment' (Category: Cybersecurity,\
  \ Domain: Asset Security, Subdomain: Asset Provisioning, Entry: Specialized Asset Provisioning > Mobile Device Provisioning).\
  \ Use university pedagogy: Bloom's Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding.\n\n**Context & Research:** Mobile Threat Defense\
  \ (MTD) protects mobile devices/data/networks via detection (EDR), prevention, response. Key terms: MTD (holistic), EDR\
  \ (device threat detection), EMM (MDM+MTD+MAM), MDM (device mgmt), MAM (app mgmt). NIST SP 800-124 deployment steps. NIST\
  \ CSF 2.0: Govern/Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover. Threats: vulnerabilities, shadow IT, phishing. Real-world: BYOD.\
  \ Sources: NIST SP 800-124, CSF 2.0, Lookout.com, GSA.gov.\n\n**Prior Knowledge:** Builds on Asset Security basics, MDM/EMM\
  \ from Mobile Device Provisioning.\n\n**Topic Hierarchy:** Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Provisioning > Specialized\
  \ Asset Provisioning > Mobile Device Provisioning > Mobile Threat Defense Deployment.\n\n**Learning Objectives:** [Insert\
  \ the 6 objectives from above].\n\n**Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers from above].\n\n**Active Learning Ties:**\
  \ Weave in references to discussions (BYOD trade-offs), peer teaching (MDM/MAM/EMM), problem-solving (phishing scenarios).\n\
  \n**Flashcard Generation Rules:**\n- Distribute: 6 Layer 1 (Remember/Understand), 7 Layer 2 (Understand/Analyze), 6 Layer\
  \ 3 (Apply), 6 Layer 4 (Analyze/Evaluate/Create).\n- Follow exact schema: Question/answer structure with distractor protocol\
  \ and explanation requirements [Insert full flashcard_schema from above].\n- Ensure measurable, active recall. Variety:\
  \ 40% MCQ, 30% cloze/definition, 15% T/F, 15% scenario/application.\n- Progressive complexity: Early cards foundational,\
  \ later integrative.\n\n**Output Format:** STRICT JSON array of 25 objects, no extra text: [\n  {\n    \"front\": \"Question\
