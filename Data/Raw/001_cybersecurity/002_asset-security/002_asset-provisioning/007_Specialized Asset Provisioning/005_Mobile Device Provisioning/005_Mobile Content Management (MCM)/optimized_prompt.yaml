learning_objectives:
  analyze:
  - objective: Analyze the relationships and differences between MCM, MDM, MAM, and EMM using a concept map or table, identifying
      common misconceptions (e.g., equating MCM with MDM).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  understand:
  - objective: Explain the role of MCM as a subset of EMM and its focus on securing corporate data on mobile devices, distinguishing
      it from device-centric MDM.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Apply NIST SP 800-124 guidelines to outline step-by-step procedures for MCM implementation in a BYOD environment.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  evaluate:
  - objective: Evaluate the security vs. usability trade-offs of MCM versus full MDM in BYOD scenarios, referencing NIST SP
      800-124 and SP 1800-22C.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  create:
  - objective: Design an MCM response plan for a lost BYOD device, integrating threat defense measures from NIST SP 1800-22C
      and broader cybersecurity principles like data loss prevention.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  remember:
  - objective: Recall the definitions of Mobile Content Management (MCM), Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM), Mobile Device
      Management (MDM), Mobile Application Management (MAM), and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Context:** Use provided research: MCM secures corporate data (subset of EMM; differs from MDM=device, MAM=apps); BYOD
  challenges; NIST SP 800-124 (deployment: COPE/CYOD); SP 1800-22C (threat defense, e.g., lost device). Voters (82.9% approval):
  Emphasize completeness (examples/cases), pedagogy (Bloom''s, activities), scaffolding (4 layers), accuracy.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full learning_objectives JSON here].

  **Active Learning:** Incorporate elements like discussion (BYOD trade-offs), peer teaching (differences), problem-solving
  (lost phone) into scenario cards.

  **Scaffolding:** Generate cards tagged to 4 layers: [Insert scaffolding_layers summary].

  **Schema:** Strictly follow flashcard_generation_schema. Output 50 flashcards in JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'':
  {...}, ''metadata'': {...}}]. Ensure distractors per protocol. Balance Bloom''s levels. Include real-world cases (e.g.,
  BYOD breach), prerequisites quiz cards. Make explanations pedagogical with voter knowledge checks integrated.'
