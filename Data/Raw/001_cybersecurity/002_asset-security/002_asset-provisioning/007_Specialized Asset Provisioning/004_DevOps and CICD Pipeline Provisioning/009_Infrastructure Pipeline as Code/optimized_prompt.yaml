active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss common misconceptions about IPaaC, such as 'IaC eliminates all human error and security risks'
    or 'pipelines are only for software, not infrastructure.' Provide real-world examples (e.g., Capital One breach due to
    misconfigured IaC) and propose mitigation strategies using security gates.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Use the following to generate high-quality, pedagogically optimized flashcards:


  **Prerequisites:** Learners know IaC basics, DevOps, CI/CD, Git.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full list from ''learning_objectives'' above].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Draw from discussion (misconceptions), peer teaching (tools), problem-solving (scenarios)
  for realistic questions.


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full list from ''scaffolding_layers'' above]. Ensure even coverage.


  **Sources:** DoD Enterprise DevSecOps Fundamentals (https://www.dmi-ida.org/download-pdf/pdf/DoD%20Enterprise%20DevSecOps%20Fundamentals_DoD-CIO_20211019.pdf),
  NIST SP 800-53 (asset security), OWASP IaC Security Cheat Sheet, CIS Benchmarks for IaC, MITRE ATT&CK (infrastructure tactics),
  Terraform/Checkov docs.


  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly follow [insert full schema from ''flashcard_schema'' above]. Output as JSON array of objects:
  [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''...'',
  ''references'': ''...''}}, ...].


  Generate exactly 50 flashcards. Prioritize active recall, misconception correction, and progression from foundation to integration.
  Use tools/examples: Terraform, GitHub Actions, Checkov, OPA, immutable infra. Make explanations concise yet comprehensive
  (50-150 words).'
