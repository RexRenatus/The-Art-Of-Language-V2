active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how network communication flow mapping differs from physical topology mapping
    (e.g., avoiding common misconception of equating flows with cabling). Discuss its role in visualizing dynamic interactions
    post-asset inventory and share real-world examples from NIST CSF ID.AM.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste array above]

  - Active Learning: Use for inspiration (e.g., MCQs from discussion misconceptions).

  - Scaffolding: 4 layers [paste array above], ensure flashcards progress through layers.

  - Research: NIST CSF ID.AM-4 (flows), MITRE ATT&CK (T1071 C2, TA0008 Lateral), tools (Wireshark/NetFlow). Prior: Builds
  on asset inventory.

  - Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), MITRE ATT&CK (https://attack.mitre.org/), NIST IR 7621 Rev1

  Generate 25 flashcards following EXACT schema: {front, back, type, bloom_level, distractors (array for MCQ), explanation,
  references}. Balance Bloom''s/cognitive progression. Distractors: Plausible per protocol. Include 2-3 formative-style MCQs
  with explanations/remediation. Output as numbered JSON array. Ensure active recall, no rote memorization.'
