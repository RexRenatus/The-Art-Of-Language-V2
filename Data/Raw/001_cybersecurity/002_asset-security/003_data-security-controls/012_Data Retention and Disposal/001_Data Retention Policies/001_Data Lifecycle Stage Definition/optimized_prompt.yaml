  **Topic Hierarchy Context:** Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Security Controls > Data Retention and Disposal > Data
  Retention Policies > Data Lifecycle Stage Definition.


  **Full Research Context (Completed and Expanded per Best Practices/NIST/CISSP):** The data lifecycle spans from creation
  to destruction, securing CIA Triad at each stage.


  **Core Concepts:** Data Lifecycle: Creation/Acquisition to Disposal. CIA Triad: Confidentiality (access controls), Integrity
  (tamper-proofing), Availability (redundancy).


  **Stages:**

  1. **Creation/Acquisition:** Generate/obtain data. Cyber: Classify/label (e.g., public/confidential), initial access controls,
  input validation (CIA: Integrity/Confidentiality).

  2. **Use/Processing:** Manipulate/analyze data. Cyber: Least privilege, logging, DLP (CIA: All).

  3. **Storage:** Save data at rest. Cyber: Encryption (AES-256), backups, physical security (CIA: Confidentiality/Availability).

  4. **Sharing/Dissemination:** Transmit/share data. Cyber: TLS/encryption in transit, ACLs, watermarking (CIA: Confidentiality/Integrity).

  5. **Archival/Retention:** Long-term storage per policies. Cyber: Immutable storage, retention schedules, auditing (NIST/GDPR
  compliance) (CIA: Availability/Integrity).

  6. **Disposal/Destruction:** Securely purge data. Cyber: NIST 800-88 (overwriting, degaussing, shredding), verification
  (no recovery) (CIA: Confidentiality).

  - Scaffolding Layers: [Paste the full scaffolding_layers array here].

  - Active Learning: Reference scenarios like Equifax in explanations.


  **Generate Flashcards Exactly per Schema:** [Paste the full flashcard_schema here]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards,
  e.g., [{''question'': ''...'', ''type'': ''mcq'', ...}]. Ensure high-quality, spaced repetition-friendly (active recall),
  university-level pedagogy.'
