    - Use common confusions (e.g., longevity vs. capacity; obsolescence vs. susceptibility)
    - From voter MCQ examples and research terms
    - 1-2 plausible (semi-correct), 1 absurd
    - Avoid 'all/none' options
    - Base on trade-offs (e.g., tape cheap but susceptible)

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema. Incorporate:

  - Topic hierarchy for context.

  - Learning objectives (span REMEMBER to CREATE).

  - Scaffolding layers (tag each card with layer 1-4).

  - Active learning ties (e.g., reference discussion prompts in explanations).

  - Research context: Definitions (longevity, obsolescence, etc.), standards (NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-88r1.pdf,
  NIST SP 800-209, ISO 14721 OAIS), media types/trade-offs.

  - Prior knowledge: Link to IT storage basics (HDD/SSD) and data classification.

  - Progressive complexity: 30% Layer 1/REMEMBER, 25% Layer 2/UNDERSTAND-APPLY, 25% Layer 3/ANALYZE, 20% Layer 4/EVALUATE-CREATE.

  - Concept map integration: Cards on factors branching from central node.

  - Formative assessments: Include 5-7 MCQs with distractors per protocol.
