active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the effectiveness of degaussing versus overwriting for different security levels (Clear vs. Purge
    per NIST 800-88). When might degaussing fail (e.g., high-coercivity media or non-magnetic SSDs), and what alternatives
    exist? Support arguments with NIST guidelines and real-world examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., wrong NIST level); 3) Extreme/unrealistic (e.g., no verification needed). Ensure plausible via voter/research insights
    (e.g., coercivity mismatch, EPL ignorance).'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST-aligned topics. Generate\
  \ 50 high-quality Anki-style flashcards on 'Degaussing for Magnetic Media' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security\
  \ > Data Security Controls > Data Retention/Disposal > Data Sanitization Methods (NIST 800-88) > Degaussing). \n\nIncorporate\
  \ these pedagogical elements: \n- Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]. Ensure ~8-10 cards per Bloom's level. \n\
  - Scaffolding: Structure cards progressively across 4 layers [insert scaffolding details]. Tag each card with layer. \n\
  - Active Learning: Tie 20% of cards to activities [insert active learning details]; e.g., 'Apply to healthcare scenario'.\
  \ \n- Research: Base on NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 2 (Purge for magnetic; coercivity in Oe), NSA EPLs (Type I/II degaussers), magnetic\
  \ media (HDDs/LTO), limitations (no SSDs). \n\nFollow Flashcard Schema exactly [insert schema details]. Output as JSON array:\
  \ [{'front': '...', 'back': {'answer': '...', 'explanation': '...', 'distractors': ['opt1', 'opt2', 'opt3'], 'scaffolding_layer':\
  \ 1, 'related_activity': '...', 'bloom_level': 'APPLY'}}]. Vary formats: 40% MCQ, 30% Q&A, 20% scenario, 10% cloze. Ensure\
  \ distractors are educationally valuable. Prioritize higher-order thinking in later layers."
