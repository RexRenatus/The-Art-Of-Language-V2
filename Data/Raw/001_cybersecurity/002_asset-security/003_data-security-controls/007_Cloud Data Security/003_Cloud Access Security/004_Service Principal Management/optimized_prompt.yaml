active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios would you prefer managed identities over traditional service principals? Discuss the
    trade-offs in terms of security (e.g., no credential management), manageability (e.g., automatic lifecycle), and development
    effort (e.g., simpler integration), using examples from Azure Security Benchmark controls like IM-3. Consider real-world
    breaches involving over-privileged service accounts, such as those in supply chain attacks like SolarWinds.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Research Context (Complete Summary):**

  Service principals are crucial for Azure cloud IAM as non-human identities for apps/services, preventing over-privileged
  accounts in Zero Trust model (e.g., SolarWinds exploits). Core: Service Principal (directory instance of app), Application
  Object (global template), Managed Identity (auto-managed SP), Credentials (secrets/certificates). ASB IM-3: Use managed
  IDs/SPs with restrictions, auto-rotate creds via Key Vault; AM-4: Inventory assets. Steps: az ad app create, az ad sp create,
  az role assignment create. Integrate: Key Vault, PIM, Sentinel.

  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Reference discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving in explanations to encourage deeper engagement.


  **Flashcard Generation Instructions:**

  - Create 25-35 MCQs per the exact flashcard_schema.

  - Distribute: Layers 1-4 evenly; Bloom''s progressively.

  - Ensure voter consensus: completeness (full CLI/examples), pedagogy (measurable objs), structure (concept map refs), big
  picture (Zero Trust/AS B).

  - Link to prior: Azure AD basics.
