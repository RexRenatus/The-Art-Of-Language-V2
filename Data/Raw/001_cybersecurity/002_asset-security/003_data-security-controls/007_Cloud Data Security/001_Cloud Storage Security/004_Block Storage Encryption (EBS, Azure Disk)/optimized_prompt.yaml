active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of using service-managed keys versus customer-managed
    keys for block storage encryption in EBS and Azure Disk. Consider scenarios involving regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR,
    HIPAA) and insider threats. Reference NIST SP 800-53 controls and provide evidence from AWS/Azure documentation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 1 common misconception (e.g., ''EBS encryption only protects in transit'' vs. at rest).

    - 1 related but incorrect term (e.g., ''Azure Blob'' for Disk).

    - 1 edge case reversal (e.g., ''Service-managed offers no compliance control'' vs. limited control).

    Ensure distractors teach via explanation (e.g., ''Why wrong: Confuses block with object storage'').'
