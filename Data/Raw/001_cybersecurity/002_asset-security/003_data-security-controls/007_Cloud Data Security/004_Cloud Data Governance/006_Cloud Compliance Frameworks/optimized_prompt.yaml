active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the shared responsibility model, debate the top three responsibilities customers often neglect in
    cloud environments (e.g., data classification, access management, encryption) and propose strategies to address them using
    ISO/IEC 27017 controls. Support your arguments with real-world examples from frameworks like NIST CSF or CSA CCM.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ from: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Provider handles all
    security'' vs. shared model); 2) Partial truths (e.g., ISO 27001 features but not cloud-specific); 3) Similar frameworks
    (e.g., NIST CSF vs. CSA CCM); 4) Real-world pitfalls (e.g., neglecting customer IAM in HIPAA). Ensure one distractor is
    a frequent error from research (e.g., confusing compliance with security).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Topic: Cloud Compliance Frameworks (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset
  Security > Data Security Controls > Cloud Data Security > Cloud Data Governance > Cloud Compliance Frameworks). Use this
  optimized structure:


  Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]


  Active Learning (inspire cards): [INSERT FULL active_learning OBJECT HERE]


  Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL scaffolding ARRAY HERE]


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards covering all layers (7-8 per layer), spanning all Bloom levels proportionally. Ensure
  completeness: Include ISO 27001/27017, NIST CSF, CSA CCM, FedRAMP, SOC 2, PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR with brief descriptions.
  Incorporate research: Definitions (cloud compliance, shared model), importance (data protection, risk mitigation), misconceptions.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards matching EXACTLY this schema: [INSERT FULL flashcard_schema.structure HERE].


  Best practices: Questions active/recall-focused; explanations scaffolded (link to prior layers, prerequisites like basic
  cloud/shared model); distractors per protocol; tie to discussion/problem-solving (e.g., HIPAA AWS scenario). Vary difficulty
  progressively.'
