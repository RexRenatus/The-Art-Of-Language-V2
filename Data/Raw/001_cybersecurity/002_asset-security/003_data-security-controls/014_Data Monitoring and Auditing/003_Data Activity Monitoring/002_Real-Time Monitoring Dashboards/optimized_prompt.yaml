active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages and limitations of real-time monitoring dashboards versus
    periodic reports in detecting insider threats to cloud assets. Reference NIST SP 800-137 and provide examples of KPIs
    that would be most critical in such scenarios.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 distractors per MCQ from common misconceptions (e.g., 'Periodic monitoring is sufficient for real-time threats'
      vs. correct continuous).
    - 'Base on research gaps: Confuse CAASM with CASB; ISCM with IAM; Splunk with SIEM-only.'
    - 'Use near-misses: e.g., Correct KPI ''vulnerability count''; distractor ''batch scan frequency''.'
    - Ensure 1 highly plausible distractor from partial truths (e.g., NIST SP 800-53 rev instead of 800-137).
    count: Aim for 75% MCQs with distractors
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Topic: Real-Time Monitoring Dashboards
  (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Security Controls > Data Monitoring and Auditing > Data Activity Monitoring
  > Real-Time Monitoring Dashboards). Use the provided research context (complete with NIST SP 800-137: ISCM; 800-137A: Assessment;
  800-53: Controls; tools like Splunk/ELK; KPIs/best practices), learning objectives, active learning activities, scaffolding
  layers (incl. prior knowledge & concept map), and flashcard schema to generate 50 high-quality flashcards.

  Incorporate pedagogy: Map to Bloom''s levels/objectives; scaffold from Layer 1-4; reference active learning. Follow schema
  exactly: Front/Back structure, distractors per protocol, explanations with context. Balance types. Output as JSON array
  of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''blooms_level'': ''...'', ''references'':
  ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''active_learning_link'': ''...''}}, ...]. Ensure voter consensus (84.3%): Full
  NIST coverage, tools, misconceptions for distractors.'
