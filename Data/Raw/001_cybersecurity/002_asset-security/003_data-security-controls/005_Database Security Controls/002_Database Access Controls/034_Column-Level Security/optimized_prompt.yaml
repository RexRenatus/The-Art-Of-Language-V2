  **Topic Hierarchy (use exactly):** Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Security Controls > Database Security Controls
  > Database Access Controls > Column-Level Security.


  **Core Content (Incorporate Fully):**

  - Foundation: Definitions (column-level security, data masking, granularity); Prior knowledge (RBAC, row-level security,
  least privilege).

  - Components: Relationships (Policy Tags-BigQuery, Masking Policies-Snowflake, Data Realms/ACLs-Oracle); Concept map interconnections.

  - Implementation: Steps/SQL for BigQuery/Snowflake/Oracle.

  - Integration: GDPR/standards compliance, scenarios.

  - Research Sources: BigQuery docs (policy tags), Snowflake docs (masking policies), Oracle docs (data realms), GDPR principles.


  **Learning Objectives (Target Evenly):** [Insert full list from above].


  **Scaffolding:** Build cards progressively across 4 layers [Insert full scaffolding from above].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Each card back includes a hook to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving [Insert full
