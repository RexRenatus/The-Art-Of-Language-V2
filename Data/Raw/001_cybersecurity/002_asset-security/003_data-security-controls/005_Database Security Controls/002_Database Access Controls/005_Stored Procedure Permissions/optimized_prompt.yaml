active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a high-security financial database, debate the trade-offs of using ownership chaining for stored procedures
    versus requiring explicit permissions on underlying tables. Consider impacts on the principle of least privilege and potential
    attack vectors.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse EXECUTE with SELECT/INSERT; mix
      DEFINER/INVOKER effects; overlook ownership chaining bypass).
    - 'Distractors: 1 semantically close (partial truth), 1 opposite/extreme, 1 unrelated but technical-sounding.'
    - Ensure correct answer aligns with research/voter consensus (e.g., least privilege emphasizes minimal EXECUTE grants).

  Core Content (Web-grounded + Voter Completions):

  - Definitions: Stored Procedure (precompiled SQL logic), EXECUTE Permission (to run proc), Principal (user/role), Securable
  (object), Ownership Chaining (bypass if same owner), SQL SECURITY DEFINER (owner privs, default), INVOKER (caller privs).

  - Best Practices (Full): Principle of least privilege (grant only EXECUTE, not tables); use roles; cautious ownership chaining
  (avoid if possible for transparency); prefer INVOKER; regular usage audits; module signing for trust; minimal grants/revokes.

  - Implementation: GRANT EXECUTE ON proc TO role; ALTER PROC ... WITH EXECUTE AS; MySQL: CREATE PROC ... DEFINER=''user''@''host''
  SQL SECURITY INVOKER.

  - Prior Knowledge: Extends SQL roles/permissions.

  - Big Picture: Enforces data protection in Asset Security.
