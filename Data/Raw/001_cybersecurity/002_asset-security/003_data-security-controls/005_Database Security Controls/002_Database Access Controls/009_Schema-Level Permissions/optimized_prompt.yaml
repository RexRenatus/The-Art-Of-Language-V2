active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss the risks of over-granting schema-level permissions (e.g., ALTER on a schema leading to unauthorized
    object modifications) versus the convenience of manageability in a multi-user enterprise database environment. Provide
    real-world examples from breaches like the Capital One incident (2019), where misconfigured database permissions enabled
    data exfiltration, and propose mitigation strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (4 options: 1 correct, 3 distractors): Distractors must be plausible based on common errors—e.g.,
    confuse schema with database perms ("GRANT on database"), wrong hierarchy (object-level only), syntax errors (missing
    ::), over/under-privileging (e.g., CONTROL instead of SELECT), multi-DBMS variants (PostgreSQL syntax). Ensure distractors
    teach via negation.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 25-30 high-quality flashcards on ''Schema-Level Permissions''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Security Controls > Database Security Controls > Database Access
  Controls > Schema-Level Permissions). Ensure coverage of provided learning_objectives, drawing from scaffolding layers,
  active_learning examples, and research context (schemas as namespaces, principals/securables/perms, SQL Server T-SQL focus
  with PostgreSQL/Oracle notes, NIST SP 800-162 RBAC, best practices like least privilege/audits, real-world: Capital One
  breach, GDPR/HIPAA, multi-tenant DBs). Sources: Microsoft SQL Server Docs (docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/authentication-access),
  PostgreSQL GRANT (postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-grant.html), NIST SP 800-162.


  Prioritize active recall: Questions test definition, explanation, code-writing, analysis, evaluation, design. Strictly follow
  flashcard_schema for structure, distractor_protocol, and explanation_requirements. Distribute across Bloom''s levels per
  objectives. Scaffold progression: 30% Layer1/2, 40% Layer3, 30% Layer4. Incorporate active learning hooks (e.g., risk scenarios,
  role perms). Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards—no extra text.'
