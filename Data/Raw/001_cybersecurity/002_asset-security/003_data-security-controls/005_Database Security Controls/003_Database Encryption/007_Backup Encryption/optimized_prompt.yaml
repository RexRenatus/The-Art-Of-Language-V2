active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a resource-constrained environment, should organizations prioritize encrypting backups at rest or
    in transit? Use NIST SP 800-111, real-world ransomware examples (e.g., stolen tapes), and trade-offs in performance/cost
    to argue your position.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Encryption only for data
    in transit'' vs. at rest); 2) Partial truths (e.g., wrong standard like ''PCI-DSS'' instead of NIST); 3) Confusions (e.g.,
    symmetric vs. asymmetric mix-up); 4) Real-world errors (e.g., no key rotation). Ensure plausible to advanced learners.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Backup Encryption''
  (Category: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Security Controls > Database Security Controls > Database Encryption >
  Backup Encryption).


  **Context & Content:** Use this synthesized content:

  - Research: Backup encryption encodes data with ciphers/keys for confidentiality (at rest: stored media; in transit: transfers).
  Key mgmt: generate/store/rotate/revoke keys. NIST SP 800-111 (storage encryption), SP 800-57 (key mgmt), CSF 2.0 (Protect/immutable
  backups), AWS Well-Architected (encrypt all data, KMS).

  - Scaffolding: Prior knowledge (basic crypto, data states). Layers: 1.Foundation (defs), 2.Components (algos, lifecycle,
  standards), 3.Implementation (AWS KMS/BitLocker steps, HSM), 4.Integration (ransomware, compliance).

  - Concept map: Backup Encryption → Data at Rest/In Transit → Key Mgmt (NIST) → Database Encryption parent.

  - Sources: [insert full sources list from scaffolding].

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list].

  - Active Learning: Tie cards to discussion (trade-offs), peer teaching (key processes), problem-solving (healthcare scenario).


  **Task:** Generate 40-50 flashcards strictly following the schema: [insert full flashcard_schema.structure, distractor_protocol,
  generation_rules].

  Ensure: Progressive complexity (foundation first), voter priorities (pedagogy, completeness, scaffolding), web-grounded
  (NIST/AWS exact terms). Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, e.g., [ {card1}, {card2}, ... ]. No extra text.'
