active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss a real-world breach caused by default accounts (e.g., the Mirai botnet for IoT parallels or database
    exposures like the 2019 Capital One breach involving misconfigured DB credentials). What could have been done differently
    to mitigate risks through default account management?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

  **Completed Research Context:** Default accounts are pre-configured with known credentials (e.g., MySQL ''root''/'''', Oracle
  ''SYS''/''change_on_install'', SQL Server ''sa''/blank), increasing attack surface and enabling privilege escalation. Manage
  via least privilege: identify, change/disable/remove. NIST SP 800-53 Rev5 IA-12(1): Change default/factory passwords; CM-6:
  Configuration settings. NIST SP 800-171 Rev2 3.5.2: Employ account management processes (directly relevant for CUI protection,
  requiring disabling unnecessary accounts). Sources: NIST SP 800-53r5 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf);
  NIST SP 800-171r2 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171r2.pdf); CIS MySQL Benchmark v1.3.0
  (https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/mysql); OWASP Database Security Cheat Sheet (https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Database_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html).
