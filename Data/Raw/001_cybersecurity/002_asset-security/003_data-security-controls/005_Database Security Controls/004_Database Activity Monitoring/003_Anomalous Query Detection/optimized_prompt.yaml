  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: 'Think-pair-share: Students pair up; one explains normal vs. anomalous behavior with examples (e.g., off-hours
    bulk data export as anomalous), the other teaches a detection technique (e.g., ML vs. rules). Switch roles and share with
    class. Addresses misconceptions like all anomalies being malicious.'
  problem_solving: Provide anonymized query logs from a real-world e-commerce database scenario. Students in groups establish
    a baseline from normal logs, then detect anomalies (e.g., unusual SELECT on PII from new IP). Use tools like Excel or
    Python for analysis to apply hands-on detection.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs, create 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions: 1) Confuse normal/anomalous
    (e.g., ''routine backup'' as anomalous). 2) Mix detection methods (e.g., attribute statistical traits to ML). 3) Oversimplify/overstate
    (e.g., ''100% accurate'' or ignore false positives). Ensure distractors draw from research context (e.g., IP/source errors)
    and voter-noted misconceptions (e.g., all anomalies malicious).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert educational flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity topics, using university-style
  pedagogy (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Anomalous Query
  Detection'' in Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Security Controls > Database Security Controls > Database Activity
  Monitoring > Anomalous Query Detection.


  Incorporate these elements:

  - PRIOR KNOWLEDGE: Link to SQL queries, access controls, general monitoring.

  - RESEARCH CONTEXT: Anomalous query detection identifies deviations in database queries (e.g., SQL) from normal baselines
  to prevent threats like exfiltration. Techniques: Statistical (outliers in rate/location), ML (supervised/unsupervised pattern
  learning), Rule-based (predefined), Behavioral. NIST CSF: Detect function (DE.CM, DE.AE). CIS Controls: Continuous monitoring.
  Examples: Flag off-hours PII SELECT from new IP. Sources: NIST Cybersecurity Framework v2.0, CIS Controls v8, OWASP Database
  Security Cheat Sheet.

  - SCAFFOLDING: [insert the 4 layers from above, including concept map and big picture].

  - ACTIVE LEARNING: Use as context for application cards (e.g., discussion trade-offs in evaluations).


  Generate exactly 50 flashcards following the FLASHCARD SCHEMA: [insert full schema from above]. Ensure variety across Bloom''s
  levels/layers, web-grounded accuracy, and distractors per protocol. Output ONLY the JSON array of flashcards, no additional
