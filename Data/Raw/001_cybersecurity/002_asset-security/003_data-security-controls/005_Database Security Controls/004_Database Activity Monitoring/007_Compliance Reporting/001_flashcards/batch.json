        "core_logic": "The MP family is crucial for data security because it addresses the physical and logical handling of media. By implementing controls for media access, storage, transport, and sanitization, organizations can prevent data leakage or compromise from media, because media often contains sensitive information and requires specific protection measures.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly assign core functions of 009_System and Communications Protection (SC), Identification and Authentication (IA)/Access Control (AC), and Contingency Planning (CP) to the Media Protection (MP) family, demonstrating a misunderstanding of MP's specific focus on the protection of media.",
        "analogy": "Media Protection is like securely storing and transporting important physical documents. It involves locking them in a safe, ensuring they are transported securely, and properly destroying them when no longer needed, to prevent unauthorized access or loss."
