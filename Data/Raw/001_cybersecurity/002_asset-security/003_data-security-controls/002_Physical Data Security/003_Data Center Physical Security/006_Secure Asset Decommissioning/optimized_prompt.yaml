  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema:

  1. Basic Q&A (40%): Front: Question | Back: Answer + Explanation + Bloom''s + NIST Ref.

  2. MCQ (30%): Front: Q + A/B/C/D | Back: Correct + Why distractors wrong + Bloom''s + Source.

  3. Scenario-Based (30%): Front: Scenario Q | Back: Reasoning + Answer + Trade-offs + Layer.


  Balance: 20% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 50% Evaluate/Create. 25% per scaffolding layer. Distractors: Plausible
  misconceptions (e.g., HDD methods on SSDs). Output as JSON array of objects: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'':
