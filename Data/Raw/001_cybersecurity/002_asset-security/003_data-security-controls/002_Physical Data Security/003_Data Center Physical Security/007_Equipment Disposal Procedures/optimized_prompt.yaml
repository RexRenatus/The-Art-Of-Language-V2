active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss a real-world case where a company suffered a data breach due to improper e-waste disposal (e.g.,
    recycled laptops containing sensitive customer data). What were the root causes, and how could proper media sanitization
    and chain of custody have prevented it? Consider trade-offs between security, cost, and environmental responsibility.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Deleting files sanitizes
    data''); 2) Confusable term (e.g., mix Clear vs. Purge); 3) Partial truth (e.g., valid for HDD but not SSD). Ensure distractors
    test subtle understanding without being obvious.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Asset Security > Data Security
  Controls > Physical Data Security > Data Center Physical Security > Equipment Disposal Procedures.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema. Cover the topic comprehensively, drawing from NIST SP 800-88
  (Guidelines for Media Sanitization), Lansweeper best practices (https://www.lansweeper.com/blog/itam/it-asset-disposal-best-practices-and-data-security-compliance/),
  and real-world breach cases (e.g., data leaks from recycled devices).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [insert full list from above]

  - Scaffolding layers: [insert full scaffolding from above]

  - Active learning for context (e.g., reference scenarios in explanations).

  - Prior knowledge: Assume familiarity with asset inventory and data classification.

  - Key content: Sanitization methods (Clear/Purge/Destroy), chain of custody, steps (inventory/sanitize/verify/dispose),
  audit readiness (documentation), asset lifecycle integration.


  Follow flashcard schema exactly:

  - Balance Bloom''s levels and layers.

  - MCQs: 40% with 3 distractors.

  - Explanations: 2-4 sentences, tie to objectives/layers/sources.

  - Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, no extra text.'
