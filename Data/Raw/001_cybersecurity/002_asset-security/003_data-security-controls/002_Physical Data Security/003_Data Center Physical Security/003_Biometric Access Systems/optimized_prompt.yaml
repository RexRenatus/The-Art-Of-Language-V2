  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the ethical implications of biometric access systems in data centers: Does the security benefit
    (e.g., defense-in-depth for CIA triad) outweigh privacy risks and spoofing vulnerabilities? Support arguments with FAR/FRR/IAPAR
    metrics and real-world examples like fake iris photo attacks.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

    rules:
    - Generate 3-4 plausible distractors for MCQs based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse FAR with FRR, verification
      with identification, physiological with behavioral).
    - 'Use near-misses: Swap metrics (FAR vs. FRR), examples (fingerprint as behavioral), or standards (NIST SP 800-53 vs.
      800-76-2).'
    - 'Ensure distractors teach: Explanation must clarify why wrong (e.g., ''FAR measures impostor accepts, not genuine rejects—that''s
      FRR'').'
    - 'Vary difficulty: 1 easy (obvious wrong), 2 medium (confusable terms), 1 hard (subtle trade-off).'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Biometric Access Systems\
  \ (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Security Controls > Physical Data Security > Data Center Physical\
  \ Security > Biometric Access Systems).\n\nGenerate high-quality Anki-style flashcards optimized for spaced repetition,\
  \ active recall, and Bloom's Taxonomy. Incorporate these EXACT elements:\n\n**Learning Objectives:** [Paste the full learning_objectives\
  \ array here]\n\n**Active Learning Integration:** Weave in concepts from discussion (ethics/FAR trade-offs), peer teaching\
  \ (physiological/behavioral/process), problem-solving (design with PAD/thresholds).\n\n**Scaffolding:** Distribute flashcards\
  \ across 4 layers: Foundation (20%), Components (25%), Implementation (25%), Integration (30%).\n\n**Content Sources:**\
  \ Use provided research context, complete standards (NIST SP 800-76-2: biometric protection guidelines; FIPS 201; ISO/IEC\
  \ 19794: data formats; ISO/IEC 24745: template security; FIDO; Common Criteria). Big picture: Defense-in-depth for CIA in\

  \ '... (link to objective/layer/active element)', 'bloom_level': '...', 'layer': '1-4', 'source': '...'}}, \n\n**Schema\
  \ Compliance:** [Paste full flashcard_schema here]. Vary types (def, process, MCQ with 3-4 distractors, scenarios). Explanations:\
  \ 2-4 sentences, correct misconceptions, tie to real-world (e.g., spoofing attacks).\n\nPrioritize completeness, pedagogy,\
  \ and voter consensus (85.7% approval). Ensure no criminal assistance; focus on ethical, compliant security."
