active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between data integrity verification techniques (e.g., computational
    overhead of SHA-256 hashing vs. speed of CRC checksums) in a ransomware-prone environment. How does this impact recovery
    objectives like RTO/RPO? Support with NIST SP 1800-25 examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (2) Partial truth (e.g., valid for availability but not integrity), (3) Extreme/outdated (e.g., MD5 instead of SHA-256).
    Ensure distractors test nuance from scaffolding layers and voter priorities (e.g., CIA mix-up).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Data Integrity Verification
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Security Controls > Data Backup and Recovery > Recovery Objectives
  and Testing > Data Integrity Verification). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning components, scaffolding
  layers (4 progressive layers), and flashcard schema to create optimized Anki-style flashcards.


  Incorporate:

  - Voter consensus: Hashing (SHA-256), checksums/CRC, digital signatures; NIST SP 1800-25/800-30; CIA triad links; recovery
  integration.

  - Research: Data lifecycle protection, attacks (ransomware, etc.), assets.

  - Pedagogy: Progress Bloom''s (Remember to Create); scaffold from foundation to integration; active elements (e.g., reference
  discussion in explanations).


  Generate 25 flashcards: 30% Basic Q&A (Remember/Understand), 40% MCQ (Apply/Analyze with distractors per protocol), 30%
  Scenario (Evaluate/Create). Balance across scaffolding layers (6-7 per layer).


  Output strictly in JSON array of objects: [{''type'': ''Basic|MCQ|Scenario'', ''front'': ''text'', ''back'': ''text'', ''bloom_level'':
  ''Remember'', ''scaffolding_layer'': 1, ''explanation'': ''detailed per requirements''}]. Ensure university-level rigor,
  no fluff, high retention via spaced repetition best practices.'
