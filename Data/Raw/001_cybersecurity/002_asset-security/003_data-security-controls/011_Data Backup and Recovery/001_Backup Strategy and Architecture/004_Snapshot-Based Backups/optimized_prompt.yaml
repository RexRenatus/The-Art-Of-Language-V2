active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the advantages and limitations of snapshot-based backups (CoW vs. RoW) compared to traditional
    full backups in achieving low RPO and RTO. Use NIST CSF PR.IP-4 (Information Management) as a reference. Which approach
    is better for a high-availability e-commerce site under ransomware threat? Consider trade-offs in storage, performance,
    and recovery reliability.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Context:** Ground all content in provided research: Snapshots are point-in-time copies using CoW (copy before write) or
  RoW (redirect writes); enable low RPO/RTO; vs. traditional backups (faster, efficient); NIST CSF PR.IP-4 (backups), PR.DS-1
  (encryption), PR.DS-6. Prior knowledge: full/incremental backups. Sources: Web summaries on CoW/RoW mechanisms.
