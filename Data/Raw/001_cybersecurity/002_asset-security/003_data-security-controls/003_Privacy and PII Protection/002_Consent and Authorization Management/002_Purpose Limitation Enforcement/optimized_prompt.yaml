active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent should companies be permitted to repurpose anonymized personal data for secondary purposes
    like AI training without re-obtaining consent? Use NIST Privacy Framework (CT.PO-P), NIST SP 800-53 PT-3, and real-world
    examples like targeted advertising scandals or fitness app data misuse to support your position. Address misconceptions
    about anonymization removing all purpose limits.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    removes limits''); 2) One reversal of correct concept (e.g., ''compatible'' vs. ''incompatible''); 3) One unrelated/overly
    broad term (e.g., confuse PT-3 with PT-2). Ensure plausible, derived from topic content/research.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Purpose Limitation Enforcement
  (Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Security Controls > Privacy and PII Protection > Consent and Authorization Management
  > Purpose Limitation Enforcement). Use the EXACT topic_hierarchy: {''level1'': ''Cybersecurity'', ''level2'': ''Asset Security'',
  ''level3'': ''Data Security Controls'', ''level4'': ''Privacy and PII Protection'', ''level5'': ''Consent and Authorization
  Management'', ''level6'': ''Purpose Limitation Enforcement''}.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste full learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: [Paste full active_learning object here]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [Paste full scaffolding_layers array here]

  - Prior Knowledge: PII, consent, asset security basics.

  - Content: Purpose Limitation (specified/explicit/legitimate purposes only; no incompatible processing). NIST SP 800-53
  PT-3: a) Identify PII purposes; b) Document; c) Restrict to identified/compatible. Other: PT-2, CT.PO-P (NIST Privacy Framework),
  GDPR Art. 5(1)(b).


  Generate 20 flashcards (5 per scaffolding layer, balanced across Bloom''s levels). Follow EXACT flashcard_schema:

  - Multiple choice: 1 correct answer, EXACTLY 3 distractors (per protocol).

  - Front: Question only.

  - Back: correct_answer, distractors (labeled A/B/C/D with correct marked), explanation (per requirements), bloom_level,
  scaffolding_layer, references.

  - Cover all layers progressively; integrate active learning examples (e.g., fitness app, anonymization debate).

  - Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, misconception-busting.


  Output as JSON array of flashcards: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''correct_answer'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''d1'',''d2'',''d3''],
  ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''references'': [''...'']}, ''topic_hierarchy'':
