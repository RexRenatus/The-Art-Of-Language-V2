active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the challenges of implementing the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) in a large organization
    where usability is often prioritized over security. Provide real-world examples from breaches (e.g., SolarWinds or Colonial
    Pipeline) where privilege creep contributed to the incident, and propose balanced mitigation strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors: 1 common misconception (e.g., ''full admin rights for efficiency''), 1 related but
      incorrect concept (e.g., ''confuse with Principle of Separation of Duties''), 1 edge case or partial truth (e.g., ''temporary
      privileges without revocation'').'
    - Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter-noted issues like privilege creep or usability trade-offs.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy\
  \ using Bloom's Taxonomy, active learning, and 4-layer scaffolding. Topic: Least Privilege Principle Implementation (Category:\
  \ Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Security Controls > Access Control for Data > Authorization and Privilege Management).\n\
  \nIncorporate this full content context:\n- Core Concepts: PoLP grants minimal necessary permissions; reduces attack surface;\
  \ prevents privilege creep; includes JIT access and Zero Trust.\n- Best Practices (complete): 1. Default deny/low privileges.\
  \ 2. RBAC roles. 3. JIT access. 4. Regular audits/reviews. 5. Monitoring/logging. 6. Automation. 7. User training.\n- Standards:\
  \ NIST SP 800-53 (AC-6), CIS Controls (Control 6), OWASP guidelines.\n- Prior Knowledge: Authentication vs. Authorization.\n\
  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the 6 objectives from above].\n- Scaffolding: Generate exactly 10 flashcards per layer [Insert\
  \ scaffolding descriptions].\n- Active Learning Ties: Reference discussion on usability challenges, peer teaching on JIT/RBAC,\
  \ problem-solving on privilege creep audits.\n\nOutput 40-50 flashcards strictly following this schema per card:\n{\n  \"\

  \ Questions test progressive complexity (foundation to integration). Distractors are plausible per protocol: 1 misconception,\
  \ 1 related concept, 1 partial truth. Explanations scaffold learning and connect to objectives/activities. Output as a JSON\
  \ array of objects."
