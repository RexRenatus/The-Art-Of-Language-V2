  Core Content (Web-grounded Research + Voter Completions):

  - FGA: Precise, context-aware authorization beyond coarse-grained (e.g., RBAC). Uses user/resource attributes, relationships
  (e.g., Zanzibar), context (time/IP/threat).

  - Key Components: PDP (decides), PEP (enforces).

  - Standards: NIST SP 800-53 (AC family), SP 800-205/207 (Zero Trust), XACML, OPA (Rego policies), Google''s Zanzibar, AWS
  IAM conditions.

  - Prior Knowledge: RBAC (coarse), auth vs authz.

  Scaffolding Layers:

  Active Learning Tie-Ins: Ensure flashcards support discussion (e.g., hospital debate), peer teaching (PDP/PEP), problem-solving
  (cloud policy design).


  Generate flashcards per this Schema:

  [Insert full flashcard_generation_schema here].


  Best Practices: High-yield (80/20 rule), active recall, spaced repetition friendly. Explanations scaffold from Layer 1-4,
  reference objectives/standards/sources (e.g., NIST links: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf).
  Vary difficulty; include images/diagrams in explanations if textual (e.g., ''PDP -> PEP flow''). Output ONLY valid JSON
  array of flashcards, each with ''type'', ''front'', ''back'' object, and ''metadata''.'
