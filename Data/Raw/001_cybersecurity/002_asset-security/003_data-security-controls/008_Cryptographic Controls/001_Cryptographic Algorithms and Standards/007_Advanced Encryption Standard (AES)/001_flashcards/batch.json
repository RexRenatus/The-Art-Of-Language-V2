Using approved modes ensures that the algorithm's security properties are maintained and prevents vulnerabilities like deterministic encryption or padding oracle attacks that can arise from insecure or custom modes, thus protecting data confidentiality and integrity.",

Following the instructions ensures the furniture is stable and functional (secure), while improvising could lead to a wobbly or unsafe result (vulnerable)."
