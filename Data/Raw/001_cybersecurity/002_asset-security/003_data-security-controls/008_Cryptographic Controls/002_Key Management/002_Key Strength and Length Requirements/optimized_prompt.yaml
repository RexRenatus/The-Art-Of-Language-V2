active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of prioritizing key length versus key strength in resource-constrained IoT devices.
    Should NIST minimums (e.g., AES-128 for 128-bit strength from SP 800-57) be strictly followed, or adapted for practicality?
    Use security strength tables and real-world examples to support arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Outdated NIST values (e.g., 80-bit legacy). 3) Swapped algorithms (e.g., AES-256 strength as 128). 4) Edge cases (e.g.,

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² CISSP domains. Topic:\
  \ Key Strength and Length Requirements (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Security Controls > Cryptographic\
  \ Controls > Key Management > Key Strength and Length Requirements). Use NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 Rev. 5 (key management, strength\
  \ tables: e.g., AES-128=128-bit, RSA-2048=112-bit, ECC-256=128-bit; cryptoperiods: symmetric 1-2y), SP 800-131A Rev. 2 (transitions:\
  \ RSA-2048 until 2030, AES approved indefinitely, 3DES legacy post-2023).\n\nIncorporate:\n- Learning Objectives: [paste\
  \ full list above].\n- Scaffolding Layers: [paste full scaffolding above] – ensure cards progress from Layer 1 to 4.\n-\
  \ Active Learning: Tie explanations to discussion (IoT trade-offs), peer teaching (RSA strength example), problem-solving\
  \ (financial scenario with brute-force calc).\n\nGenerate 30 high-quality flashcards following this exact schema per card:\n\

  \ Use precise NIST data; add tables/examples in explanations. Distractors per protocol: plausible errors only."
