active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between using on-premises HSMs versus cloud-based HSMs (e.g.,
    AWS CloudHSM) for key storage in a financial institution. Consider factors like cost, scalability, compliance (FIPS 140-3),
    and tamper resistance. Support arguments with references to NIST SP 800-57.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL LAYER CONTENT FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving where relevant.


  Generate flashcards per this schema: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD_SCHEMA FROM ABOVE].

  Ensure coverage: 25% Layer 1 (foundation), 25% Layer 2 (components/standards), 25% Layer 3 (implementation), 25% Layer 4
  (integration). Align to Bloom''s: progressive from Remember to Create.

  Use voter consensus: Emphasize FIPS 140-3 details, NIST SP 800-57, HSM features (tamper resistance, no key export), risks
  of alternatives.

  Output ONLY the JSON array of flashcards, no extra text.'
