active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a scenario requiring PCI DSS compliance for payment data transfer, debate whether SFTP or SCP is more
    appropriate, considering functionality (e.g., directory listings and audits), performance, and audit requirements (e.g.,
    logging capabilities).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator synthesizing university-level pedagogy for ''SFTP and SCP Protocols''
  in Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Security Controls > Cryptographic Controls > Encryption in Transit.


  **Core Content**: Use this exact scaffolding, objectives, active learning, concept map, prerequisites, and sources [INSERT
  FULL scaffolding JSON FROM ABOVE HERE]. Ensure flashcards build progressively (Layer 1-4) and span Bloom''s levels.


  **Pedagogy Integration**:

  - Align to objectives: Mix REMEMBER (defs), UNDERSTAND (explanations), APPLY/ANALYZE (scenarios/comparisons), EVALUATE/CREATE
  (critiques/designs).

  - Active Learning: Include Qs inspired by discussion (PCI DSS debate), peer teaching (analogies), problem-solving (HIPAA
  PHI transfer with interruptions).

  - Scaffolding: Tag each card by layer; start simple, build to integration.


  **Output Format**: JSON array of flashcards, strictly following the flashcard_schema. Generate 30 high-quality, optimized
  flashcards (no duplicates). Vary types; make fronts concise/active (e.g., ''Why choose SFTP over SCP for...?''). Explanations
  reference research/sources/objectives. Ensure measurable, testable content for spaced repetition.'
