          "text": "It eliminates the need for any human oversight.",

      ],
      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Automation is critical because manual certificate management is error-prone and scales poorly, leading to security risks like expired or mismanaged certificates. It functions by integrating tools for discovery, issuance (e.g., ACME protocol), deployment, and monitoring, thereby enforcing policies consistently.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors overstate automation's benefits (no human oversight, guaranteed speed) or limit its applicability, failing to recognize its role in enhancing security and efficiency across the board.",
        "analogy": "Automation in CLM is like using a self-checkout lane at a grocery store; it's faster and reduces the need for a cashier for routine tasks, but a human is still available for complex issues."

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Discovery is the foundational step in CLM because you cannot manage what you do not know exists; an unknown certificate is an unmanaged risk. It functions by using tools to scan networks and systems to locate all certificates, their associated private keys, and their properties.",
