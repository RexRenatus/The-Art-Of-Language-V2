active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In groups, debate whether data asset inventory management is more critical for compliance (e.g., GDPR
    Article 30 records of processing activities) or risk mitigation (e.g., preventing breaches like Equifax). Use NIST CSF
    2.0 Govern function to support arguments, addressing the misconception that inventory is 'just paperwork'.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Inventory replaces classification''),
    2) Partial truth (e.g., confuses attributes like owner with location), 3) Extreme/edge case (e.g., ignores unstructured
    data). Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter-noted misconceptions (e.g., paperwork-only view, data type confusion).
    Distractors must be grammatically similar and contextually close to correct answer.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for the topic ''Data
  Asset Inventory Management'' (Category: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Security Controls > Data Classification and
  Labeling > Data Discovery and Inventory > Data Asset Inventory Management).


  **Research Context (Web-Grounded):** Data asset inventory management systematically identifies, catalogs, tracks, and manages
  data assets (structured: databases/spreadsheets; unstructured: documents/emails/images). Essential for cybersecurity (CSAM),
  compliance (GDPR Art. 30: records of processing incl. data mapping), risk mitigation (e.g., Equifax breach). NIST CSF: Identify/Protect
  (SP 1800-28 data confidentiality); CSF 2.0 adds Govern for oversight. Sources: NIST.gov (CSF 2.0, SP 1800-28, SP 800-53),
  GDPR.eu (Art. 30), scytale.ai (CSAM), cybersecurity frameworks like CIS Controls.


  **Concept Map:** Central: ''Data Asset Inventory Management'' → Branches: ''Data Assets (structured/unstructured)'' → ''Inventory
  Catalog (attributes: name/type/owner/location/sensitivity/usage/compliance)'' → ''CSAM'' → ''NIST CSF (Identify/Protect/Govern
  2.0)'' → ''GDPR Data Mapping'' → Dependencies: Builds on Data Classification/Discovery.
