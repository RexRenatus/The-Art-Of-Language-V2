active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains the differences between SCCs and BCRs under GDPR (including use cases and
    EDPB recommendations), while the other creates and teaches back a simple diagram. Switch roles and discuss applicability
    to non-EU frameworks like APEC CBPR.
  problem_solving: 'For a fictional multinational e-commerce company expanding from the US to EU and Asia: Map data flows
    (e.g., customer data to cloud servers), identify compliance gaps (GDPR TIA, PIPL localization), and propose documentation
    solutions. Think-pair-share misconceptions like ''All countries have equivalent protections.'''

  Incorporate this full research context: Cross-border data flows involve personal/sensitive data movement across jurisdictions
  via cloud, transactions, etc. Key terms: data privacy/protection, asset security, governance, localization. Frameworks:
  GDPR (adequacy decisions, SCCs for controllers/processors, BCRs for intra-group, TIA per EDPB Guidelines 05/2021 post-Schrems
  II requiring supplementary measures like encryption); CCPA (California consumer opt-out for sales); PIPL (China: localization
  for critical data, security assessments for exports); LGPD (Brazil: adequacy-like for some); APEC CBPR (voluntary cross-border
  rules). Best practices: Map flows, assess risks, document with diagrams/audit trails, use tools like DLP. Sources: edpb.europa.eu
  (Guidelines 05/2021), gdpr.eu, iapp.org, cnil.fr/pIPL.


  Use these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert array above]

  - Active Learning: [insert active_learning above]

  - Scaffolding: [insert scaffolding above]


  Generate flashcards exactly in the schema: [insert flashcard_schema.structure above]. Output as a JSON array of objects.
  Ensure high-quality: questions test progression from foundation to integration, distractors via protocol, explanations educational
  with ties to objectives/layers/activities. Balance coverage: all objectives, frameworks, steps, prior/related concepts.'
