  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the trade-offs of VPNs for data transfer in high-risk environments like remote work over public
    Wi-Fi: Do they provide sufficient confidentiality, integrity, and replay protection, or should alternatives like SD-WAN
    or zero-trust networks be preferred? Reference NIST SP 800-77 examples and address usability vs. security.'
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains IPsec ESP (confidentiality + integrity + authentication via encryption and
    hashing) while the other explains AH (integrity + authentication only, no confidentiality; uses ICV for verification).
    Switch roles, teach back to the group, and correct misconceptions like 'VPNs provide full anonymity' (they hide traffic
    from ISP but not from VPN provider).
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A company with remote employees needs secure data transfer over public Wi-Fi. Design a VPN solution
    specifying protocols (e.g., IPsec tunnel mode with ESP), countermeasures for replay attacks (sequence numbers), traffic
    analysis (obfuscation), and evaluate risks if misconfigured (e.g., no PFS leading to key compromise). Present as a step-by-step
    plan.'

  Incorporate research (NIST SP 800-77r1): VPN secures IP traffic at Layer 3; ESP: confidentiality/integrity/auth; AH: integrity/auth
  only; IKE phases; replay protection (sequence nums).
