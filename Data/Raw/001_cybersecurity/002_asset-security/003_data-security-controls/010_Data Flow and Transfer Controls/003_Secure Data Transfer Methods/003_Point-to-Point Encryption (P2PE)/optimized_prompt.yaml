  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''P2PE eliminates all risks in payment processing because
    POI devices are infallible.'' Use evidence from PCI standards to support or refute, addressing misconceptions like confusing
    P2PE with end-to-end encryption.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
