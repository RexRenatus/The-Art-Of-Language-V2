active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a company implementing BYOD, how should NAC policies balance security and user convenience? Debate
    the pros and cons, using evidence from real-world breaches like SolarWinds, and propose policy adjustments based on posture
    assessment and quarantine features.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  4 Data Flow and Transfer Controls > Level 5 Network Segmentation for Data > Level 6 NAC.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards optimized for spaced repetition and Bloom''s Taxonomy. Incorporate these learning objectives:
  [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY]. Use the 4-layer scaffolding: [INSERT scaffolding ARRAY]. Include active learning hooks
  like discussion prompts or scenarios from [INSERT active_learning OBJECT].


  Core content from research: NAC enforces policies via AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting), posture assessment
  (OS/AV checks), policy enforcement, quarantine/remediation, profiling, segmentation. Benefits: Breach prevention (e.g.,
  SolarWinds). Prior knowledge: IP addressing, firewalls, basic auth. Misconceptions: NAC only for users; replaces firewalls.


  Output strictly in JSON array of flashcards, each with: {''type'': ''basic|mcq|scenario'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'':
  ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': 1-4, ''explanation'': ''Detailed rationale + distractor debunk
  if MCQ''}.


  Follow flashcard_schema: [INSERT flashcard_schema OBJECT]. Ensure active recall, no cues in front. Distractors per protocol.
  Balance coverage: Foundation (definitions), Components (AAA/concept map), Implementation (steps/functions), Integration
  (BYOD/IoT/HIPAA).'
