active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a Zero Trust environment, debate the trade-offs between comprehensive metadata recording for security
    (e.g., provenance, classification, timestamps) and privacy concerns (e.g., exposing user data in EXIF tags). Use DoD Metadata
    Guidance and NIST IR 7693 to support arguments, considering compliance and breach auditing.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    only descriptive, ignore security); 2) partial truth (e.g., timestamps but omit provenance); 3) opposite/extreme (e.g.,
    no metadata for privacy). Base on real standards to avoid randomness; explain why wrong in back.'

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards optimized for spaced repetition (Anki-style), covering all Bloom''s levels via these
  objectives: [insert learning_objectives array]. Ensure coverage: 30% Remember/Understand, 40% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate/Create.


  Content structured by 4 scaffolding layers: [insert scaffolding object]. Incorporate research: NIST IR 7693 (asset ID),
  DoD Metadata Guidance (functional areas: identification, provenance, etc.), Zero Trust, prior knowledge (EXIF/timestamps),
  big picture (traceability/compliance).


  Use exact flashcard schema: [insert flashcard_schema object]. Balance types, generate distractors per protocol. Infuse active
  learning: Include 3-5 cards prompting discussion/peer teach/problem-solving (e.g., ''Debate: ...'').


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, e.g., [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}, ''tags'': [...]},
  ...]. No extra text.'
