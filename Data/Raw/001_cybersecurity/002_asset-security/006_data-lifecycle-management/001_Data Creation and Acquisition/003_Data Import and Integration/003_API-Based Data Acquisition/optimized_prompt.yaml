active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss the misconception that 'API keys alone suffice for security.' In groups, identify why this is
    insufficient (e.g., static secrets, no authorization), reference OWASP API Top 10 risks like Broken Object Level Authorization,
    and propose layered defenses. How does this relate to shadow APIs in an organization?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
