    - 'Plausible but incorrect: e.g., Confuse zoning with VLANs; mix SAN block-level with NAS file-level.'
    - 'Common misconceptions: e.g., ''SAN is slower than NAS'' (false, SAN is high-speed); overstate physical security irrelevance.'
    - 'Related but wrong: e.g., Distractors from NAS/DAS features, unrelated protocols (iSCSI vs. Fibre Channel).'
    - 'Edge cases: Partial truths, e.g., ''Encryption only at rest'' (ignores transit).'
    balance: Ensure distractors test nuance (e.g., hard vs. soft zoning security trade-offs)

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use discussion/peer/problem-solving prompts as hooks in scenario cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers [INSERT FULL LAYER DESCRIPTIONS].

  - Prior Knowledge: Anchor to LAN/WAN, DAS, NAS.

  - Big Picture: CIA triad, NIST CSF, ISO 27001.

  - Research: SAN = block-level access (vs. NAS file-level); threats (credential theft, eavesdropping); controls (NIST SP
  800-209: zoning, LUN masking, encryption, MFA); attack surface (physical/network/management).


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards following this exact schema [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD SCHEMA]. Output as JSON array: [{''id'':1,
  ''layer'':''layer1_foundation'', ''blooms_level'':''REMEMBER'', ''front'':''...'', ''back'':{''answer'':''...'', ''explanation'':''...'',
  ''references'':[''...''], ''related_objective'':''...''}}, ...]. Ensure active recall, no hints in fronts, distractors per
  protocol. Prioritize university pedagogy: measurable, scaffolded, integrative.'
