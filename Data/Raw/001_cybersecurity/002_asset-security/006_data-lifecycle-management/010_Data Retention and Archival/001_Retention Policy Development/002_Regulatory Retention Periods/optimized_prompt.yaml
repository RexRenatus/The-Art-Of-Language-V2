active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between strict regulatory retention periods (e.g., SOX 7 years) and privacy principles
    like GDPR's data minimization—how can organizations optimize storage costs while avoiding fines? Cite specific examples
    and common misconceptions, such as uniform retention across all data types.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  \n**Core Content**: Use ONLY the provided scaffolding layers (Foundation to Integration), learning objectives, active learning\
  \ ideas, and voter-researched standards (NIST AU-11, ISO 27001 A.12.4, GDPR Art 5(1)(e), HIPAA 6y PHI, SOX 7y audits, PCI-DSS\
  \ 1y logs, NIST rec 3mo/12mo). Include sources in explanations.\n\n**Pedagogy Integration**:\n- Align flashcards to Bloom's\
  \ levels (span all objectives).\n- Promote active recall, spaced repetition.\n- Inspire active learning (e.g., scenario\
  \ Qs for problem-solving).\n- Scaffolding: Ensure progression (Layer 1 basics → Layer 4 advanced).\n\n**Generation Rules**:\n\
  - Generate exactly 30 high-quality flashcards.\n- Cover: 10 foundational/standards, 10 implementation/apply, 10 integration/evaluate-create.\n\
  - Variety: 15 MCQs (w/ distractors), 15 cloze/short answer.\n- Questions: Specific, measurable (action verbs); use scenarios,\
  \ comparisons, misconceptions.\n- Make challenging yet fair; explanations 50-150 words.\n\n**Output Format**: JSON array\
  \ of objects:\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"front\": \"Question text...\",\n    \"back\": {\n      \"correct_answer\":\
  \ \"...\",\n      \"explanation\": \"...\",\n      \"bloom_level\": \"...\",\n      \"related_layer\": \"1-4\",\n      \"\
  distractors\": [\"A: ... (wrong because...)\", \"B: ...\", \"C: ...\"]\n    }\n  }\n]\n\nPrioritize completeness, accuracy,\
