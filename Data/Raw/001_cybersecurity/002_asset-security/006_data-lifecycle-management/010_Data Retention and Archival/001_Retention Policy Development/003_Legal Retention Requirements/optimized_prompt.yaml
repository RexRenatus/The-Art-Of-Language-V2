active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of over-retention (increased breach risk and storage costs) versus under-retention
    (legal penalties like 2023 FTC fines). Use real-world cases and propose balanced strategies.
  peer_teaching: 'In pairs: Student A explains NIST AU-11 (Audit Record Retention) and its application to data lifecycle;
    Student B summarizes key elements and quizzes Student A with scenario-based questions.'
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: For a fintech firm handling PII and financial data, design a retention policy with a disposition
    flowchart. Justify periods based on IRS (7 years), GDPR, and include litigation hold procedures.'

    1. Common misconception (e.g., ''Retention = indefinite storage'').

    2. Plausible extreme (e.g., too short ''1 year'' vs. actual 7 years IRS).

    3. Confused concept (e.g., mix GDPR with HIPAA periods or NIST families like AU vs. AC). Ensure distractors are realistic
    based on voter-noted errors (over/under-retention).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² CISSP-aligned topics.

  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives [PASTE FULL LIST ABOVE].

  - Active learning [discussion/peer/problem-solving for question inspiration].

  - Scaffolding layers [build questions progressively: 10 Layer 1-2, 15 Layer 3, 15 Layer 4].

  - Prerequisites/big picture [anchor questions].

  - NIST details: AU-11 (''retain audit records for organization-defined periods''); IRS 7yrs; GDPR storage limitation; HIPAA
  6yrs; sources: NIST SP 800-53r5 (doi:10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r5), IRS Pub 583, GDPR 2016/679.


  Use flashcard schema exactly: MCQ front/back JSON, distractor protocol, explanations with Bloom/objective/layer/source.

  Distribute: 10 Remember/Understand, 15 Apply/Analyze, 15 Evaluate/Create. Ensure measurable, active recall. Vary formats
  (scenarios, comparisons). Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''correct'': ''A'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''bloom'': ''...'', ''objective'': ''...'', ''layer'': 1, ''source'': ''...''}}, ...]. No extras.'
