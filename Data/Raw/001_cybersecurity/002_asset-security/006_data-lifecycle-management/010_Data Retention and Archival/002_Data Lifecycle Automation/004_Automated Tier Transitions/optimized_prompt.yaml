active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between cost savings and security risks in automated tier
    transitions (e.g., moving sensitive data to cold storage). How do these align with CISSP Asset Security principles and
    regulations like GDPR or HIPAA? Provide examples from AWS S3 or Azure.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Common errors (e.g., ''manual transitions only'' vs. automated); 3) Partial truths (e.g., ''hot tier for archival''
    vs. correct use); Ensure 1 correct answer clearly superior; avoid ''all/none'' options.'

  \ Topic: Automated Tier Transitions (Level 6 in hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Lifecycle Management >\
  \ Data Retention and Archival > Data Lifecycle Automation). CRITICAL: This refers to AUTOMATED MOVEMENT OF DATA BETWEEN\
  \ STORAGE TIERS (hot, warm, cold, archive) based on access patterns/policies (e.g., AWS S3 Lifecycle/Intelligent-Tiering,\
  \ Azure Blob, Google Cloud), NOT NIST CSF maturity tiers (ignore/remove any such references).\n\nIncorporate:\n- Learning\
