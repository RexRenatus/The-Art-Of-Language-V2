active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the risks of sharing confidential cybersecurity data (e.g., threat intelligence
    or security protocols) without an NDA. How do different NDA types (unilateral vs. bilateral) mitigate these risks, and
    what prior knowledge from data classification influences NDA design? Support with real-world examples like vendor partnerships.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema. Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to activities (e.g., scenario Qs for problem-solving).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute across 4 layers [insert full scaffolding above]. Ensure completeness: Full Key Provisions (obligations,
  term, remedies, etc.), cybersecurity examples (threat intel, mergers), prior knowledge (data classification), big picture
  (breach prevention), sources (NIST SP 800-53, Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Cornell Law).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''id'':1, ''layer'':''1'', ''blooms_level'':''REMEMBER'', ''type'':''Definition'',
  ''front'':''...'', ''back'':{''answer'':''...'', ''explanation'':''...'', ''distractors'':[''A'',''B'',''C''], ''source'':''...'',
