active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the balance between stringent Email DLP rules and employee productivity. Provide real-world examples
    of over-blocking (e.g., false positives blocking legitimate contracts) versus under-protection (e.g., breaches like the
    2023 MOVEit incident via email attachments). What metrics would you use to measure optimal balance?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Core Content (Research Context - Complete Edition):**

  Data Loss Prevention (DLP) detects/prevents data breaches. Email DLP focuses on email content/attachments/metadata for data
  in motion. Sensitive data: PII, PHI, financial/IP. Standards: NIST SP 800-177 Rev.1 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-177r1.pdf)
  - SPF/DKIM/DMARC for auth, TLS/S/MIME for encryption. ACSC ISM (https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/ism)
  - Details email policies, protective markings (e.g., OFFICIAL:SENSITIVE), scanning outbound emails. Big Picture: Prevents
  ~60% email-borne breaches. Components: Regex/ML/keyword/fingerprinting scanning, rule engines. Implementation: Classify
  > Policy > Deploy > Test > Monitor. Integration: SIEM/CASB/other DLP.


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the 6 objectives from above].

  - Scaffolding: Ensure coverage of 4 layers [Insert layers summaries].

  - Active Learning Inspiration: Questions on debates (productivity vs. security), peer explanations (detection methods),
  scenarios (financial PII leak).

  - Prior/Related: Links to data states/classification; other channels (USB/cloud), controls (DMARC).


  **Task:** Generate 45 flashcards following the exact schema:

  [{front: "Question? A) D1 B) D2 C) Correct D) D3", back: {answer: "**C) Correct**", explanation: "Rationale... Layer X,
  Bloom Y, Source Z.", bloom_level: "REMEMBER", scaffolding_layer: 1, source: "NIST..."}, tags: ["Email-DLP"]}]

  Use distractor protocol: 3 realistic errors per MCQ. Vary types (MCQ 60%, cloze/short 40%). Balanced coverage: Objectives/layers.
  Output ONLY valid JSON array.'
