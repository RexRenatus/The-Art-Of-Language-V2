  Incorporate these EXACT elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the array above]

  - Active Learning: Use concepts from discussion/peer/problem-solving to inspire analytical cards (e.g., trade-offs, computations,
  debates).

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste the array above] – Ensure cards map to layers progressively.

  - Voter Priorities: Emphasize ε/δ, mechanisms (Laplace/Gaussian), NIST SP 800-226 (hazards: membership/attribute inference/reconstruction;
  frameworks: audits/proofs; guidelines: budgets/composition), misconceptions (DP≠anonymity, compositionality).

  - Research Context: DP bounds privacy loss (P[M(D)∈S] ≤ e^ε P[M(D'')∈S]+δ for neighbors D/D''); utility trade-off; examples
  (healthcare, census).
