active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a scenario where a company faces frequent ransomware attacks, debate the advantages and limitations
    of snapshot-based backups versus traditional incremental backups in achieving low RTO and RPO. Consider factors like storage
    efficiency, recovery speed, and protection against data manipulation.
  peer_teaching: Pair students and have one explain the process of creating and restoring a snapshot-based backup (including
    how incremental changes are handled) to their partner, who then teaches it back with a simple diagram. Switch roles to
    reinforce understanding and address common misconceptions like snapshots being full copies.
  problem_solving: 'Given a real-world scenario: A cloud-based e-commerce site using AWS experiences hardware failure at 2
    AM. Design a snapshot-based backup strategy specifying snapshot frequency, retention policy, and testing procedures to
    minimize data loss (RPO < 1 hour) and downtime (RTO < 30 min). Groups present and critique each other''s plans.'

    full copies'' vs. incremental; confuse RTO with RPO; mix up standards like NIST vs. MCSB). Distractors should be realistic
    errors from research/voter inputs (e.g., ignoring immutability for ransomware). Mark correct as bold.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university pedagogy (Bloom''s
  Taxonomy progression from remember to create, active learning, 4-layer scaffolding). Generate high-quality, optimized flashcards
  for the topic ''Snapshot-Based Backups'' (Category: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Lifecycle Management > Backup
  and Recovery > Backup Strategies > Snapshot-Based Backups). Voter consensus: 82.9% approval on pedagogy enhancements.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: {paste the learning_objectives array here}

  - Active Learning: Use elements from {paste active_learning object} to inspire card explanations (e.g., reference discussion
  trade-offs).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards evenly: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4. {paste scaffolding array}.

  - Research Context: {paste full web research summary, completed with: Industry Standards: NIST CSF PR.IP-4 (manage backups),
  MCSB DP-3 (data retention, immutable snapshots against ransomware), CIS Controls v8 #11 (data recovery testing), ISO 27001
  A.12.3.1 (backup procedures). Sources: NIST.gov, docs.aws.amazon.com/EBS/latest/UserGuide/ebs-snapshots.html, VMware Docs,
  Microsoft MCSB GitHub, CISecurity.org.}

  - Prior Knowledge: Assume basics like full/incremental backups known.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: {paste flashcard_schema}. Output ONLY a JSON array of 30 flashcards, e.g., [{''type'':
  ''MCQ'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''tags'': [''Layer:1'', ''Bloom:REMEMBER'']}, ...]. Ensure progression:
  40% lower Bloom''s (1-2), 40% middle (3-4), 20% higher (5-6). Cards must be concise, testable, and free of fluff. No duplicates.'
