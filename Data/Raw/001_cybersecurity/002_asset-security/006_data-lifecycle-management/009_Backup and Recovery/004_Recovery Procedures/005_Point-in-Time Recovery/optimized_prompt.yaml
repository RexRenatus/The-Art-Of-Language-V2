  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste the full learning_objectives array here].

  - Active Learning: Weave in discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving hooks (e.g., flashcards prompting scenario analysis).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute across 4 layers – tag each flashcard with layer (1-4).

  - Prior knowledge: PITR builds on basic backups/full recovery/RPO/RTO.

  - Content: Core concepts (WAL, base backup, archiving, replay, timelines); generalize beyond PostgreSQL; NIST CSF full alignments
  (Identify: ID.AM; Protect: PR.AC/PR.DS; Detect: DE.AE; Respond: RS.MI; Recover: RC.RP-1 for PITR planning). Sources: PostgreSQL
  docs (https://postgresql.org/docs/current/continuous-archiving.html), NIST CSF (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework).

  - Related: Incremental backups, full recovery, cyber risks (ransomware, corruption).

  - Concept map integration: Flashcards testing PITR-WAL-replay dependencies.


  Generate flashcards per schema: [Paste full flashcard_generation_schema here]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, no
  extra text. Ensure high-quality, spaced repetition-friendly (active recall, no cues), distractors per protocol.'
