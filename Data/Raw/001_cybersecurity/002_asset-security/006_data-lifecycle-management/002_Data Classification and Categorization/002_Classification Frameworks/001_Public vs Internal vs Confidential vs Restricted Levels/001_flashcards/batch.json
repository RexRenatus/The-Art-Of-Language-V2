If a document contains sensitive employee performance reviews that, if disclosed, could cause serious harm to the individuals involved and moderate reputational damage to the company, which classification level is most appropriate?",

        "core_logic": "Employee performance reviews contain sensitive personal information. Unauthorized disclosure could lead to serious harm to individuals (e.g., embarrassment, discrimination) and moderate reputational damage to the company. This aligns with the 'Confidential' classification, which signifies data where disclosure could cause serious adverse effects.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Classifying as 'Public' or 'Internal' is inadequate due to the personal sensitivity. 'Restricted' is typically reserved for data where disclosure could cause severe or catastrophic harm, which is a higher threshold than 'serious harm' to individuals and moderate reputational damage.",
        "analogy": "Employee performance reviews are like personal medical records; they are sensitive, and unauthorized disclosure could cause significant personal distress and organizational issues, fitting the 'Confidential' level."
