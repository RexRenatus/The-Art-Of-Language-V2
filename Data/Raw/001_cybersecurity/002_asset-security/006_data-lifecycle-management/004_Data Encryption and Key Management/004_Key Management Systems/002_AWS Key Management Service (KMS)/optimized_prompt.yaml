active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a zero-trust asset security strategy, how does AWS KMS contribute to data lifecycle management across
    AWS services like S3 and EBS? Discuss potential risks of relying solely on AWS Managed Keys versus CMKs, referencing common
    misconceptions such as assuming AWS Managed Keys offer full customer control.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
