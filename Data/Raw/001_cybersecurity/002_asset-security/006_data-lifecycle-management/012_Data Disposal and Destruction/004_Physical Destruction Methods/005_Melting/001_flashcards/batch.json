        "core_logic": "Within NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 2, melting is categorized as a 'destroy' sanitization method because its outcome is the permanent physical destruction of the media, making data irrecoverable. This is distinct from 'clear' (logical sanitization for reuse) and 'purge' (making data infeasible to recover while preserving media).",

        "analogy": "In the NIST framework, melting is like the ultimate 'delete' button for physical media – it's gone forever, not just hidden or made unreadable."

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Melting is chosen for its superior data destruction assurance, especially for highly sensitive data or media that is damaged or composed in a way that makes shredding or pulverizing less effective. The goal is absolute irrecoverability, not material recycling or preservation.",
