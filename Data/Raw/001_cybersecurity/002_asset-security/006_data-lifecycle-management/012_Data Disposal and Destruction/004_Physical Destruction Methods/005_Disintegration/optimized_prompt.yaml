  CRITICAL ACCURACY: Disintegration is PHYSICAL DESTRUCTION of data media (HDDs, CDs, tapes) using disintegrators (e.g., hammer
  mills, particle crushers) to reduce to particles <2mm (<1mm for high security) per NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1. Do NOT include
  general risks, NIST CSF, supply chain, or breaches—focus solely on physical destruction.
