active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Using NIST SP 800-88, debate when to choose clear, purge, or destroy for repurposing vs. disposing of
    media in different security contexts (e.g., public vs. classified data in a hospital setting). What risks arise from under-sanitization,
    and how does a Certificate of Sanitization mitigate them?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confusing clear with destroy reusability);
    2) Partial truth (e.g., correct method but wrong standard); 3) Extreme/overly specific (e.g., non-standard tool). Ensure
    distractors are plausible based on real-world errors from standards like NIST.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  Certificate of Sanitization (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Lifecycle Management > Data Disposal and Destruction
  > Media Sanitization Standards). Use the provided research context, core concepts (Media Sanitization: Clear/Purge/Destroy
  definitions), standards (NIST SP 800-88 Rev.1/2, ISO 27001 Annex A.11.2.7 completed: requires documented secure disposal/re-use),
  voter priorities (completeness, pedagogy), and this exact pedagogical structure:


  Learning Objectives: [Insert the 6 objectives above].

  Active Learning: Incorporate elements into flashcard explanations (e.g., reference discussion debates in analysis cards).

  Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards: 10 Layer 1 (Foundation), 10 Layer 2 (Components), 10 Layer 3 (Implementation), 10 Layer
  4 (Integration). Include Prior Knowledge Connections and Big Picture Context in relevant cards.


  Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards following this schema exactly:

  - Front: Engaging question (mix cloze, MCQ, short answer).

  - Back: Answer || Explanation (pedagogical rationale, Bloom''s level, layer link, active learning tie-in) || Distractors
  (for MCQs only, 3 with ''why wrong'') || References.

  Format each as: Front ||| Back content.

  Ensure progressive complexity, active recall, spaced repetition optimization (one fact per card), and web-grounded accuracy.
  Prioritize voter consensus (100% approval). Output ONLY the list of flashcards in numbered Anki format.'
