active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate scenarios where the Clear method is insufficient (e.g., SSDs with classified
    data) and justify switching to Purge or Destroy. Reference NIST SP 800-88 limitations and link to prior knowledge of data
    classification (confidential vs. public).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: '3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions: 1) Confuse methods (e.g., ''Degaussing''
    as Clear option), 2) Media mismatches (e.g., ''Shredding for tapes'' vs. HDDs), 3) Over/under-protection (e.g., ''Clear
    for classified data''). Ensure distractors teach via explanation (e.g., ''Why wrong: Clear doesn''t address over-provisioning
    in SSDs'').'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST SP 800-88 Guidelines
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Lifecycle Management > Data Disposal and Destruction > Media Sanitization
  Standards > NIST SP 800-88 Guidelines). Voter consensus (100% approval): Emphasize completeness (Destroy techniques: shredding,
  grinding, pulverizing, disintegration, incineration, melting), sources (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-88r1.pdf),
  Bloom''s objectives, 4-layer scaffolding, prior knowledge (data classification/asset inventory), formative assessments (MCQs,
  short answer, scenarios, reflections).


  Core Content: Media sanitization renders data irrecoverable. Key terms: data remanence, ISM (HDD/SSD/tape/flash/cloud),
  hard copy. Methods: Clear (overwrite/reset; basic protection), Purge (degauss/crypto-erase/multi-overwrite; lab-resistant),
  Destroy (physical destruction; highest assurance). SSD notes: Avoid Clear due to wear-leveling.


  Use exact learning_objectives, active_learning, scaffolding, flashcard_schema from this prompt. Generate 40-50 flashcards
  in JSON array. Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition, misconceptions via distractors. Output ONLY
  the JSON array of flashcards, no extras.'
