  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of using cryptographic erasure versus physical destruction
    for sanitizing data on SSDs in a cloud environment. Consider factors like cost, speed, environmental impact, and compliance
    with NIST SP 800-88.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
