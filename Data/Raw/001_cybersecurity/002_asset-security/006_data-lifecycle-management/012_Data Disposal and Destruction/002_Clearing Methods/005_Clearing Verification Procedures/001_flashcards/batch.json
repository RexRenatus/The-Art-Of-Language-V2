        "core_logic": "Modern storage media, including USB drives, can have complex internal structures like re-allocated sectors or wear-leveling mechanisms that might not be affected by standard overwrites. Therefore, verification must ensure that all accessible storage locations, including these potentially hidden areas, have been targeted by the clearing process, because this ensures comprehensive data removal.",

        "core_logic": "The verification for 'Clearing' directly tests its goal: data recovery infeasibility by ordinary means. This means attempting recovery. For 'Destroying', the goal is rendering the media unusable, so verification confirms the physical integrity of the destroyed media, because the methods and objectives of each sanitization type dictate their respective verification strategies.",

        "analogy": "Verifying a cleared document means checking if the message is gone. Verifying a destroyed document means checking if it's in pieces too small to reassemble."
