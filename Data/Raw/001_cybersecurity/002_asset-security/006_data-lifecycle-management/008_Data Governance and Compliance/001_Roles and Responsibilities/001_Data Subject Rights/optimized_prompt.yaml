active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent should companies prioritize data subject rights over business analytics needs? Use a case
    like targeted advertising on social media to debate the Right to Object vs. legitimate interests, incorporating common
    misconceptions (e.g., rights only apply to EU citizens) and real-world GDPR fines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Rights only for
    EU citizens'' instead of global applicability if targeting EU). 2) Confusions between rights (e.g., mix rectification
    with erasure). 3) Edge cases/exceptions (e.g., ''Always free'' vs. ''Free unless excessive''). Ensure distractors are
    realistic from research (e.g., processor vs. controller duties).'

  Rights.


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (20 basic recall, 20 MCQ, 10 application scenarios) optimized for Anki/spaced repetition.
  Cover ALL key GDPR data subject rights completely: 1. Informed (notice at collection), 2. Access (confirmation/copy/purposes),
  3. Rectification (correct inaccurate data), 4. Erasure/Be Forgotten (delete if no longer needed/consent withdrawn), 5. Restriction
  (limit processing during disputes), 6. Portability (structured/transferable format), 7. Object (to marketing/legitimate
  interests), 8. Automated Decisions/Profiling (human review). Include definitions, purposes, best practices (e.g., 1-month
  response, identity verification), examples (e.g., British Airways fine), misconceptions (e.g., controllers vs. processors),
  and comparisons (GDPR vs. CCPA).


  Incorporate university pedagogy:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full array from JSON above]

  - Scaffolding: Progress from Layer 1 (definitions: data subject, personal data, controller/processor) to Layer 4 (lifecycle
  integration).

  - Active Learning: Draw questions from discussion (e.g., objection vs. interests), peer teaching (role-play handling), problem-solving
  (merger scenarios).


  Strictly follow Flashcard Schema: [insert full schema from JSON above]. Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'':
  ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...''}]. Ensure active recall, no hints on
  front, distractors per protocol, comprehensive explanations. Prioritize voter consensus: completeness (all rights), pedagogy
  (Bloom''s progression), engagement (scenarios).'
