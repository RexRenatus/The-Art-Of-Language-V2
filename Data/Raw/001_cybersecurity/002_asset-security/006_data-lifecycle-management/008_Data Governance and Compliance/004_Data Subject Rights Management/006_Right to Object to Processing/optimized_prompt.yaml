    always requires compelling grounds—even for direct marketing'); 3) Similar/unrelated concepts (e.g., confuse with right
    to erasure); 4) Non-examples (e.g., contractual necessity scenarios). Ensure variety across Bloom's levels; balance MCQs
    (80%) with open-ended.
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in GDPR Data Subject Rights.\
  \ Use the following to create 25 high-quality flashcards on 'Right to Object to Processing' (GDPR Article 21). Incorporate\
  \ university pedagogy: Bloom's Taxonomy objectives [insert learning_objectives array here], active learning for context\
  \ [insert active_learning summary: discussion/peer-teaching/problem-solving], 4-layer scaffolding [insert scaffolding array\
  \ here]. Ensure prior knowledge links (GDPR Art 6, data governance) and big picture (data lifecycle processing stage, cybersecurity\
  \ compliance risks).\n\nTopic Hierarchy (populate exactly):\n{\n  'level_1': 'Cybersecurity',\n  'level_2': 'Asset Security',\n\
  \  'level_3': 'Data Lifecycle Management',\n  'level_4': 'Data Governance and Compliance',\n  'level_5': 'Data Subject Rights\
  \ Management',\n  'level_6': 'Right to Object to Processing'\n}\n\nResearch Context: Right to object empowers individuals\
  \ to stop processing under legitimate interests/public task/direct marketing (ICO.org.uk). Processing: broad operations\
  \ on data. Article 21(1): qualified objection; (2): absolute for marketing; (4)-(6): exemptions for research/statistical\
  \ with safeguards. Examples: targeted ads (applies); contractual (does not). Misconceptions: absolute right; applies everywhere.\n\
  \nFollow Flashcard Schema exactly [insert flashcard_schema here]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcards, e.g., [{'question':\
  \ '...', 'answer': '...', 'distractors': ['d1', 'd2', 'd3'], 'explanation': '...'}]. Ensure 3 distractors per card, web-grounded\
  \ (cite ICO/GDPR), progressive coverage of layers/objectives."
