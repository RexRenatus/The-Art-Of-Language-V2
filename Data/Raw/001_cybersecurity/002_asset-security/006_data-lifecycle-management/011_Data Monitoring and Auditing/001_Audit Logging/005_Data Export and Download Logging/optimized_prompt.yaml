    rules:
    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors: 1) Common misconception (e.g., omit privacy trade-off), 2) Partial truth (e.g., log
      only successes), 3) Extreme/overly simplistic (e.g., log everything without retention).'
    - Base on real-world errors from standards/best practices.
    - 'Ensure distractors test nuance (e.g., for APPLY: wrong field like ''file name only'' vs. full set).'

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema. Cover all Bloom''s objectives, active learning elements,
  and 4 scaffolding layers. Incorporate research context (NIST SP 800-92: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-92r1.pdf;
  best practices: log user ID, timestamp, data type/volume, source/destination, outcome), voter suggestions (concept map,
  prerequisites, lifecycle), and prerequisites (general audit logging, data classification).


  Schema:

  - 50% Basic Q&A: Front: Question (e.g., ''REMEMBER Layer 1: Define data export logging.''); Back: Answer | Explanation |
  Source | Objective link.

  - 50% MCQ: Front: Question + A/B/C/D options; Back: Correct | Why correct | Why distractors wrong | Source | Objective link.

  Distractors: 3 plausible (misconception/partial/extreme).

  Balance: 4-5 per Bloom''s level/layer. Tag each with Bloom''s, Layer, Hierarchy.

  Embed active learning: e.g., explanations reference discussion scenario or peer teaching.

  Output as JSON array: [{''type'': ''mcq'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''tags'': {...}}]. Ensure pedagogical
  depth for university-level learning.'
