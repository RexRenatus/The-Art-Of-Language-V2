  > MSP Asset Visibility).


  Incorporate this COMPLETE research context:

  ## Managed Service Provider (MSP) Asset Visibility: Comprehensive Summary

  Core Concepts: Asset Visibility (identify/track hardware/software/cloud for MSPs/clients); Enterprise Assets (laptops, servers,
  IoT, networks); OT Assets (ICS, SCADA); Asset Inventory (list with attributes).

  Industry Standards: CIS Controls v8 - Control 1: Inventory/Control Enterprise Assets; Control 2: Software Assets. NIST SP
  800-53 CM-8. ISO 27001 A.8. CISA OT Guidance. MSP focus: Third-party/supply chain.

  Best Practices: Automated discovery (CMDB, scanning), taxonomy, monitoring.
