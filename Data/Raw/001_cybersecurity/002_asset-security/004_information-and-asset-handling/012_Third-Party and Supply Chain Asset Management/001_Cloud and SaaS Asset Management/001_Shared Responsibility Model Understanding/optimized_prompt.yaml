  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the following: ''In a SaaS model like Office 365, does the customer bear
    any responsibility for data encryption at rest? Why or why not?'' Use the Shared Responsibility Model to support arguments,
    citing real-world examples from AWS or Azure documentation. Encourage critical thinking by challenging peers on common
    misconceptions like assuming CSPs handle everything.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Management > Cloud and SaaS Asset Management > Shared Responsibility Model Understanding).


  Incorporate this full research context: [Insert full completed research summary here, including tables for IaaS/PaaS/SaaS
  responsibilities, e.g., IaaS Table: CSP (physical, host OS, network); Customer (guest OS, middleware, apps, data). PaaS:
  CSP adds platform; Customer: apps/data. SaaS: CSP adds app; Customer: data/identities/configs. Sources: AWS (aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/),
  Azure (docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility), Google Cloud (cloud.google.com/security/shared-responsibility),
  NIST CSF (nist.gov/cyberframework), ISO 27001, CSA CCM.]


  Use these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste array]

  - Active Learning: Embed examples in explanations (e.g., ''As in peer-teaching activity...'').

  - Scaffolding: [paste layers] – Tag each flashcard to a layer.


  Generate flashcards per schema: [paste full schema]. Ensure completeness (detailed IaaS/PaaS/SaaS, visuals described), voter
  priorities (tables, Bloom''s progression, NIST/ISO links), and university pedagogy (active recall, spaced repetition via
  layered complexity). Output ONLY the JSON array of flashcards.'
