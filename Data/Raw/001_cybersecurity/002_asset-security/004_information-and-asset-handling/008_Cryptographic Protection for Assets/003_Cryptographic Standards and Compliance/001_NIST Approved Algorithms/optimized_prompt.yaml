  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use components to inspire scenario-based cards (e.g., discussion risks in eval questions).

  - Scaffolding: Generate flashcards explicitly tagged by 4 layers: Layer 1 Foundation, Layer 2 Components, etc. [INSERT FULL
  SCAFFOLDING FROM ABOVE]

  - Big Picture: Emphasize role in preventing breaches via compliance (e.g., finance/healthcare), linking to prior crypto
  basics.

  - Content Completeness: Focus on AES-128/192/256 (symmetric), SHA-2/SHA-3 (hashing), RSA-2048+, ECC, PQC (ML-KEM/ML-DSA);
  deprecated (SHA-1, etc.) per SP 800-131A/SP 800-57.


  Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards following this EXACT schema:
