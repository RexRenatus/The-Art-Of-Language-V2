active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare file-level encryption with full-disk encryption. Debate scenarios where one is preferable over
    the other, considering trade-offs in security (e.g., granular control vs. comprehensive protection), performance (e.g.,
    overhead on access), and usability (e.g., selective access vs. full boot protection). Reference NIST SP 800-111 for guidance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ (4 options, 1 correct): Distractors must be plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g.,
    ''Full-disk encryption'' instead of ''file-level''; ''Data in transit'' instead of ''data at rest''; wrong standard like
    ''NIST SP 800-53''; tools like ''BitLocker only for files''). Avoid random errors; ground in research (e.g., performance
    myths from NIST SP 800-111). Ensure 1-2 highly tempting distractors.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, following university pedagogy\
  \ (Bloom's Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for the topic 'File-Level\
  \ Encryption' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and Asset Handling > Media Handling and Protection\
  \ > Media Protection Techniques > File-Level Encryption).\n\n**Content to Cover:** Use this exact research summary: File-level\
  \ encryption encrypts individual files/folders on end-user devices (laptops, USBs) to protect data at rest. Core concepts:\
  \ encryption/decryption, AES algorithms, key management. NIST SP 800-111: Guide for storage encryption on end-user devices,\
  \ recommends file-level for granular protection. Tools: EFS, VeraCrypt. Big picture: CIA Confidentiality, asset security\
  \ compliance.\n\n**Learning Objectives:** [Insert full learning_objectives array here].\n**Active Learning:** Incorporate\
  \ elements into explanations (e.g., reference discussion debates, peer probes, policy design). Ensure flashcards prompt\
  \ critical thinking.\n**Scaffolding:** Distribute cards across 4 layers: [Insert full scaffolding_layers here].\n\n**Generation\
  \ Rules:** \n- Output ONLY a JSON array matching the exact flashcard_schema.\n- 25-35 cards total, balanced as specified.\n\
  - Cover all objectives, layers, active elements.\n- MCQs: Strictly 4 options (A/B/C/D), mark correct.\n- Varied types: Definitions\
  \ (Layer 1), components (Layer 2), steps/tools (Layer 3), comparisons/integration (Layer 4).\n- Plausible distractors per\
  \ protocol.\n- Tags: Use hierarchy levels, Bloom's, layer.\n- Prior knowledge: Assume basic crypto; flashcards build on\
  \ it.\n\nPrioritize accuracy from NIST SP 800-111; avoid irrelevant standards like SP 800-63."
