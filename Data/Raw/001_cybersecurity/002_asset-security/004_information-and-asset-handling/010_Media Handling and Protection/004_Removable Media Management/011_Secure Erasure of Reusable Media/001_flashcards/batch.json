        "core_logic": "Standard file deletion or drive formatting operations in most operating systems do not erase the underlying data. Instead, they mark the space as available for new data, leaving the original data recoverable by forensic tools. Secure erasure requires specific methods to overwrite or otherwise render this data inaccessible.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly suggest that deletion/formatting involves overwriting, is only difficult to reverse, or is slow, rather than accurately describing that they leave data recoverable because they don't erase the data blocks.",
        "analogy": "Deleting a file is like removing a book's title from the library catalog. The book is still on the shelf, just harder to find through the catalog. Secure erasure is like removing the book from the shelf and shredding it."

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The selection of a sanitization method must be driven by the data's sensitivity and the required assurance level (e.g., Clear vs. Purge), as defined by standards like NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 2. This ensures that the chosen method is adequate to protect the information from potential recovery efforts.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors focus on secondary factors like cost, speed, or physical condition, neglecting the paramount importance of data sensitivity and assurance levels in determining the appropriate sanitization technique.",
        "analogy": "When deciding how to secure valuables, you consider what they are worth. If it's a cheap trinket, a simple lockbox might suffice ('Clear'). If it's a priceless diamond, you'd use a bank vault ('Purge')."
