active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between user convenience (e.g., seamless media playback)
    and security when using auto-run features. Cite specific risks from malware vectors like USB drives and propose balanced
    mitigations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions: 1) Convenience-focused (e.g.,
    speed/playback), 2) Unrelated tech (e.g., auto-update), 3) Partial truth (e.g., ''Only for CDs''). Ensure distractors
    are realistic from voter/research context.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Asset Security: Removable\
  \ Media Management → Auto-run and Auto-play Restrictions. Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information\
  \ and Asset Handling > Media Handling and Protection > Removable Media Management > Auto-run and Auto-play Restrictions.\n\
  \nIncorporate these elements:\n- Learning Objectives: [Paste full list above].\n- Active Learning: Use for scenario-based\
  \ cards (e.g., discussion debates as eval questions).\n- Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers (tag each).\n- Research\
  \ Context: Auto-run/auto-play risks (malware via USB/web, MITRE T1204); Disable on Win/macOS; NIST CSF (PR.AC-3, DE.CM-7\
  \ config mgmt); CIS 8.5; Sources (NIST SP800-53 SC-39, Microsoft Docs, MITRE ATT&CK).\n- Prior Knowledge: Link to malware/USB\
  \ basics.\n- Concept Map: Central 'Restrictions' → Risks, Mitigations, Related, Dependencies.\n\nGenerate 25 high-quality\
