    Plausible but incorrect framework (e.g., mix CIS 14 with NIST ID.AM). Ensure distractors are realistic, web-grounded (e.g.,
    from Equifax case errors), and teachable moments in explanations.'

  Enhanced Research Context (completed/synthesized):

  - Need-to-know: Grant access only if required for job (distinct from authorization).

  - Supports CIS Control 14: Track/control access to critical assets per approved plans.

  - NIST CSF: Protect (PR.AC-4: Permissions with least privilege/need-to-know); Govern (GV.OC-05: Oversight ensures policy
  compliance for access controls, supporting need-to-know via governance).

  - Integrates: Zero Trust, DLP, NIST SP 800-57 encryption, asset classification.

  - Case: Equifax breach (2017) – weak need-to-know enabled mass exfiltration.

  - Sources: CIS Controls v8 (cisecurity.org/controls), NIST CSF 2.0 (nist.gov/cyberframework), NIST SP 800-53 Rev5 (nist.gov/800-53),
  NIST SP 800-57 (nist.gov/800-57).


  Incorporate: Learning objectives, active learning activities, 4-layer scaffolding, concept map (textual), big picture (reduces
  insider threats, CIS 14 mastery).


  Generate flashcards per schema: Balance 40-50 cards (10-15 per Bloom''s pair: REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, APPLY/ANALYZE, EVALUATE/CREATE;
  10-12 per scaffolding layer). Use university pedagogy: Scaffold from recall to creation. Output ONLY valid JSON array of
  flashcards.'
