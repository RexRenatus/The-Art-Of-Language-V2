active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In small groups, debate the trade-offs of implementing strict SoD in a small startup versus a large financial
    institution. How does it balance security with operational efficiency? Cite real-world examples like Enron fraud (SOX-related)
    and propose mitigations for SoD conflicts.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (2) Partial truths (e.g., lists 3/4 elements), (3) Confusions with related concepts (RBAC, auditing), (4) Real-world inversions
    (e.g., single-role approval in banks). Ensure 70% flashcards test middle/higher Bloom''s.'

  Use this optimized pedagogy:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full learning_objectives JSON array here].

  - Active Learning: Incorporate elements into explanations (e.g., ''This tests discussion-style analysis'').

  - Scaffolding: [Insert full scaffolding JSON here]. Strictly layer flashcards accordingly.

  - Prerequisites: Builds on access control (RBAC, least privilege). Related: Auditing.

  - Examples: Financial transactions (approver ≠ executor ≠ recorder). Misconceptions: SoD vs. least privilege.

  - Standards: NIST CSF/SP 800-53 (AC-5), ISO 27001 (A.10.1.3), PCI DSS (Req. 7), SOX (Sect. 404: ICFR via SoD).


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards following this exact schema: [Insert full flashcard_schema JSON here].


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"front": "Question", "back": {"correct_answer": "...", "explanation":
  "...", "distractors": ["A", "B", "C"], "metadata": {...}}. Ensure university-level rigor, active recall, spaced repetition
  optimization (concise fronts, rich backs). Vary difficulty across Bloom''s levels.'
