active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages and disadvantages of MAC versus DAC in a modern enterprise
    setting. Consider factors like enforcement by central authority, user flexibility, compliance with NIST frameworks, and
    protection of the CIA triad's confidentiality. Provide real-world examples from government or military systems.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., confuse MAC with
    DAC owner control), 2) Partial truths (e.g., reverse Bell-LaPadula rules), 3) Real-world edge cases (e.g., ignore compartments).
    Ensure distractors are realistic from research (e.g., wrong sensitivity levels) and test deeper understanding.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 20-30 high-quality flashcards on ''Mandatory Access Control
  (MAC)'' in the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and Asset Handling > Access Control for Assets
  and Information > Logical Access to Assets > Mandatory Access Control (MAC). Domain: Asset Security, Subdomain: Information
  and Asset Handling.


  Incorporate these exactly:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the full array from learning_objectives above]. Cover all levels proportionally (lower: 40%,
  higher: 60%).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [paste scaffolding array]. Recap prerequisites in Layer 1.

  - Active Learning: Embed ties in explanations (e.g., ''Use this in peer teaching on Bell-LaPadula'').

  - Research Context: MAC enforced by central authority via labels on subjects/objects. Key terms: Subject, Object, Label,
  Clearance, Sensitivity (TS/S/C/U), Compartments, Need-to-Know. Bell-LaPadula: no read up (*simple security), no write down
  (*-property). Examples: SELinux, government MLS. Big Picture: CIA confidentiality, NIST frameworks. Compare to DAC.


  Use Flashcard Schema exactly [paste full schema]. Vary question types: 60% MCQ (w/ distractors), 40% short answer. Ensure
  progressive difficulty. Voter consensus: 100% approval on pedagogy/scaffolding. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards,
  no extra text.'
