active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between implementing strict Least Privilege Principle (PoLP) in an organization
    versus user convenience and productivity. Provide real-world examples where lax PoLP led to major breaches (e.g., SolarWinds
    supply chain attack where excessive privileges enabled lateral movement) and argue for or against mandatory PoLP audits.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Distractors must be plausible:

    1. Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Least Privilege means no admin rights ever'' vs. ''minimum necessary'').

    2. Related but incorrect terms (e.g., ''Privilege Escalation'' instead of ''Privilege Creep'').

    3. Extreme opposites (e.g., ''Grant all permissions'' for PoLP definition).

    4. Partial truths (e.g., ''Reduces passwords only'' for attack surface).

    Ensure 1 correct, 3 distractors; randomize order.'

  **Topic Content (Complete and Synthesized):**

  Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP): Grant only minimum access necessary for users/programs/processes. Key Concepts: Attack
  Surface (entry points reduced); Blast Radius (damage limited); Privilege Creep (unnecessary accumulation prevented); Need-to-Know
  (info-specific). Implementation: RBAC, JIT privileges, audits. Standards: NIST SP 800-53 AC-6; OWASP Top 10 A01:2021 Broken
  Access Control (prevents violations like IDOR); OWASP SAMM. Prior Knowledge: Authentication, authorization, access control
  basics. Concept Map: Least Privilege → Attack Surface (reduces), Blast Radius (limits), Privilege Creep (prevents), Need-to-Know
  (related), NIST/OWASP (implements).


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives from above].

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers from above].

  **Active Learning Integration:** Weave in discussion (trade-offs/SolarWinds), peer teaching (office scenarios), problem-solving
  (privilege creep policy design) into explanations.


  **Generation Instructions:**

  - Create 40-60 flashcards total (10-15 per layer).

  - Balance: 20% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate, 20% Create.

  - Use Flashcard Schema: [Insert full schema from above].

  - Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''tags'': [''Bloom:remember'', ''Layer:1'']}, ...].

  - Ensure web-grounded (NIST/OWASP citations), voter-consensus complete (OWASP details, sources), engaging, and misconception-busting
  distractors.

  - Promote active learning: Questions mimic peer teaching, debates, scenarios.'
