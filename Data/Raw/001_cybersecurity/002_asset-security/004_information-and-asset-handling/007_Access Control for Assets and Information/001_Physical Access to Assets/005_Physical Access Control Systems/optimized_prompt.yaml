active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, explain authentication vs. authorization using PACS diagrams (e.g., credential reader -> controller
    -> door unlock flow). Switch roles for teach-back, then share one key takeaway with the group, linking to prior knowledge
    of logical access control.
  problem_solving: 'Design a PACS for a fictional corporate HQ: Identify risks (e.g., tailgating, insider threats), select
    components/technologies, map NIST controls (PE-3, AC-2), and outline deployment steps per NIST SP 800-116. Role-play a
    security audit of a ''breached'' facility and use think-pair-share to correct misconceptions (e.g., ''Physical access
    isn''t a cyber threat'').'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Physical Access Control
  Systems (PACS) within the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and Asset Handling > Access Control
  for Assets and Information > Physical Access to Assets > Physical Access Control Systems.


  Generate 25-35 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema provided. Cover all learning objectives (spanning Bloom''s:
  Remember/Understand, Apply/Analyze, Evaluate/Create), scaffolding layers (Foundation to Integration), and draw from research
  context (definitions: PACS, auth/authz, credential, PIV; standards: NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 (PE-3 Physical Access Control,
  AC-2 Account Management), NIST SP 800-116 (smart cards/PIV), HSPD-12, NIST RMF). Include big picture: PACS role in preventing
  physical bypass of digital controls for compliance/mastery.


  Incorporate prior knowledge (links to logical access control), misconceptions (auth=authz, PACS only tech, physical not
  cyber), and active learning examples (e.g., RFID vs biometrics debate, PACS design exercise).


  Use flashcard schema precisely: Balance types/layers/objectives. Distractors from protocol. Explanations detailed with references.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, e.g., [{''type'': ''...'', ...}]. No extra text.'
