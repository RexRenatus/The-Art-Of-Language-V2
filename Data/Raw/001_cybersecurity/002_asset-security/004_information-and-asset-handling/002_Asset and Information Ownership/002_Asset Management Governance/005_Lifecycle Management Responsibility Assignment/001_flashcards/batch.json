        "core_logic": "The 'Assess' step is crucial because it involves analyzing gathered information (criticality, threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, impact) to gauge the actual risk exposure, thereby providing the necessary data to inform subsequent risk response decisions. This analytical phase is a core component of any risk management framework.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors describe the activities of the 'Frame,' 'Respond,' and 'Monitor' steps, misattributing them to the 'Assess' step.",
        "analogy": "Assessing risk is like a doctor diagnosing a patient – they review symptoms (threats, vulnerabilities), consider the patient's history (criticality), and estimate the likelihood and severity of illness (impact) to determine the diagnosis (risk)."
