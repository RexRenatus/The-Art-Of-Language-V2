  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (min. 4 options, 1 correct): Create 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions:

    - Distractor 1: Confuse with data owner duties (e.g., ''Defines classification'' instead of ''Implements controls'').

    - Distractor 2: Overstate/exaggerate role (e.g., ''Legally accountable'' vs. delegated).

    - Distractor 3: Real-world variant (e.g., cloud-specific vs. general). Ensure distractors are 70% plausible from research
    context.'
