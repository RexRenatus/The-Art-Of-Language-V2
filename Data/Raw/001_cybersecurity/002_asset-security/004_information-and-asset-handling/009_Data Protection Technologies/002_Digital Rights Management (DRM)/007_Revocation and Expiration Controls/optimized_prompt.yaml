  Generate 40-50 high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized flashcards using the exact schema provided. Cover all elements
  below proportionally:


  **Learning Objectives (span Bloom''s Taxonomy):** [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ''learning_objectives'']


  **Active Learning Integration:** Weave in elements from discussion prompt, peer teaching, and DigiNotar problem-solving
  exercise as explanation ties or scenario-based cards.


  **Scaffolding Layers (10 cards per layer):** Strictly follow content in [INSERT FULL ''scaffolding_layers'']. Ensure progression:
  Foundation builds recall, up to Integration for synthesis.


  **Prior Knowledge:** Link cards to authentication, certificates, PKI basics.


  **Big Picture/Context:** Cards must reference asset security lifecycle and post-compromise protection.


  **Sources:** Cite NIST SP 800-53 (AC-2, IA-5), SP 800-63B, DigiNotar breach.


  **Output Format (JSON Array):** [{''type'': ''cloze|qa|mcq'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''REMEMBER'',
  ''layer'': ''1'', ''objective'': ''1'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''tags'': [''PKI'', ''revocation'']}, ...]


  Use schema: [INSERT FULL ''flashcard_generation_schema'']. Ensure active learning, misconceptions via distractors, and pedagogical
  progression for mastery.'
