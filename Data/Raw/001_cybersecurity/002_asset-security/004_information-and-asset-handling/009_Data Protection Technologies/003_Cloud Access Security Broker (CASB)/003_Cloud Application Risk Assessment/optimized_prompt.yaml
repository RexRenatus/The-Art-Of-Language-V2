active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of the Shared Responsibility Model, debate whether organizations overestimate CSP security
    or underestimate their own responsibilities in cloud apps. Use examples from recent breaches like Capital One (2019) to
    support arguments. Consider how CASB could mitigate such issues.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Use this synthesized content:

  - Core Concepts: Cloud App (SaaS/IaaS/PaaS), Risk Assessment, CIA Triad, Shared Responsibility Model (CSP: ''of'' cloud;
  Customer: ''in'' cloud).

  - Frameworks: NIST SP 800-53 (controls: AC, AU, SI; rev5), NIST SP 800-30 (9-step process: Prepare/Conduct/Communicate/Maintain),
  CSA CCM, ISO/IEC 27017, CIS Cloud Controls.

  - CASB: Visibility, Compliance, DLP, Threat Protection.

  - Examples: Salesforce scenario, Capital One breach.

  - Prerequisites: CIA, Cloud Models, Risk Mgmt.
