  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]

  - Active Learning: Use discussion, peer teaching, and problem-solving to inspire scenario-based cards.

  - Scaffolding: Cards must reference Layers 1-4 progressively (e.g., basic defs in Layer 1, advanced integration in Layer
  4).

  - Research Context: Assets (Tenable); Data Discovery (NIST SP 1800-28); Cyber Exposure/RBVM (Tenable studies); NIST CSF
  2.0 ID.AM subcategories (ID.AM-1 Physical assets; ID.AM-2 Software; ID.AM-3 Flows; ID.AM-4 External systems; ID.AM-5 Connected
  resources; ID.AM-6 Personnel). Sources: https://docs.tenable.com/cyber-exposure-studies/asset-inventory/Content/PDF/Tenable_Cyber_Exposure_Study-Asset_Inventory_and_Discovery.pdf;

  Ensure pedagogical alignment: Active recall, spaced repetition friendly, distractors promote critical thinking. Output ONLY
  a JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'',
  ''layer'': 1-4, ''distractors'': [...]}}]. Aim for 25 cards covering all objectives and layers.'
