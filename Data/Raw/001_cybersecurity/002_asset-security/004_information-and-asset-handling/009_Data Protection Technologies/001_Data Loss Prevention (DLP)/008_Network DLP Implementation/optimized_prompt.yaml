active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a debate format, argue whether Network DLP should prioritize blocking all potentially sensitive data
    transmissions or focus on high-risk channels like email and web uploads. Consider trade-offs in compliance (e.g., GDPR,
    HIPAA), usability, user productivity, and false positive rates. Support arguments with real-world examples from industry
    breaches.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., confuse inline/out-of-band).

    - Distractor 2: Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''blocks all traffic'' vs. selective).

    - Distractor 3: Related but wrong concept (e.g., endpoint DLP feature).

    Ensure distractors are plausible, derived from real-world errors or edge cases; avoid obvious wrongs.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university-level pedagogy\
  \ (Bloom's Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards for the topic 'Network DLP Implementation'\
  \ (Category: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and Asset Handling > Data Protection Technologies > Data Loss\
  \ Prevention (DLP) > Network DLP Implementation).\n\n**Core Content (Complete Summary, Incorporating Voter Consensus & Research):**\
  \ Use this full, web-grounded content:\n- **Core Concepts:** [Insert full core concepts from research, plus expansions].\
  \ Network DLP monitors traffic for exfiltration of sensitive data (PII/PHI/IP) via inspection (content/context). \n- **Standards:**\
  \ NIST CSF (Protect: PR.DS-5), NIST SP 800-53 (SC-7, AC-4), ISO 27001 A.8.2.3, CIS Control 13.\n- **Best Practices (Completed):**\
  \ 1. Classify data. 2. Develop policies (content regex/ML, context rules). 3. Deploy sensors (inline/out-of-band at firewalls/proxies/email).\
  \ 4. Tune (reduce FPs). 5. Integrate SIEM/CASB/UTM. 6. Incident workflows. 7. Monitor KPIs.\n- **Sources:** NIST CSF (nist.gov),\
