active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a cybersecurity breach scenario involving a ransomware attack on a mid-sized company's network, debate
    how inaccurate or outdated CMDB data could exacerbate the incident (e.g., unknown dependencies) and propose 3+ mitigation
    strategies using ITIL SACM practices like configuration audits and baselines. (Encourages critical thinking, peer debate,
    and real-world application; 10-15 min group discussion with synthesis share-out.)
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''CMDB = all assets, not
    just CIs''), 2) Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Service Asset has no financial value''), 3) Opposite/extreme
    (e.g., ''CMS is a single database''). Base on voter-noted misconceptions (asset vs. CI), research (truncated NIST), and
    cybersecurity context (e.g., ignore compliance role). Ensure distractors teach via error.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for university-level cybersecurity education on ''ITIL Asset and Configuration
  Management'' (Topic Hierarchy: Level 1 Cybersecurity > Level 2 Asset Security > Level 3 Information and Asset Handling >
  Level 4 Compliance and Regulatory Requirements > Level 5 Standards and Frameworks Compliance > Level 6 ITIL Asset and Configuration
  Management). Use the provided research summary (Service Asset: financial value items; CI: service-impacting subset; CMDB:
  CI database; CMS: logical model; Baseline: snapshot; SACM in ITIL lifecycle for risk/compliance), complete with NIST SP
  800-128 integration (security config mgmt emphasizing baselines/audits).


  Incorporate pedagogy: Learning objectives [insert full list above]; Active learning [discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving];
  Scaffolding [4 layers as above]. Prerequisites: Basic ITIL/asset classification. Big picture: SACM for cybersecurity asset
  security, compliance (GDPR/SOX), risk mitigation.
