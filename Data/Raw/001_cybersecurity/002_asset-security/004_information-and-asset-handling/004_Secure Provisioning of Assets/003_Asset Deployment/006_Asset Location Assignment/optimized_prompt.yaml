  discussion_prompt: In a hybrid cloud environment, debate the challenges of assigning locations to assets across on-prem
    servers, virtual machines, and SaaS applications. How does this impact incident response times and zero-trust architecture
    implementation?

  **Completed Research Context:**

  Asset location assignment ensures organizations know physical/logical asset positions for security, risk, and response.
  Core concepts: Asset (hardware/software/data); Inventory (updated list); Location (physical: building/room/rack; logical:
  network/cloud); Assignment (documenting in CMDB). NIST SP 1800-5 (IT Asset Management): Tracks locations/configs for visibility;
  manual entry or automated. CISA Guidance (Cybersecurity Performance Goals): The process involves continuous asset discovery,
  inventorying with locations, and tracking changes to enable visibility and rapid response. Big Picture: Enables zero-trust,
  compliance (CIS Controls v8 #1, ISO 27001 A.8). Sources: NIST SP 1800-5 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1800-5.pdf);
  CISA Asset Visibility (https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cybersecurity-best-practices/asset-management).

  **Active Learning Inspiration:** Use elements like hybrid debates, peer teaching (NIST examples), post-merger scenarios
  to inspire scenario flashcards.


  **Instructions:** Generate exactly 50 flashcards covering all objectives and layers proportionally. Mix types per schema.
  Ensure questions promote active recall. Reference research/standards in explanations. Output as JSON array: [{''front'':
