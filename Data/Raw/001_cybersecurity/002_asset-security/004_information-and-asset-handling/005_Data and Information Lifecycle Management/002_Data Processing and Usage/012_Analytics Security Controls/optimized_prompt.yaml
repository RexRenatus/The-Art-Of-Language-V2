active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how analytics security controls like SC-8 and SI-12 prevent breaches in
    data-driven decision-making. Provide real-world examples from recent data leaks (e.g., analytics platform breaches) and
    propose improvements. (Encourages critical thinking and evidence-based arguments.)
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
