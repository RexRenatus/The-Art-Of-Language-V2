active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the balance between least privilege (NIST AC-6) and availability in archives during legal holds.
    Use a case study of a regulatory audit delay in a healthcare organization where overly restrictive controls prevented
    timely data retrieval—argue for or against relaxing controls temporarily and propose mitigations.
  peer_teaching: 'Jigsaw activity: Divide learners into expert groups, each mastering one NIST AC control relevant to archives
    (e.g., Group 1: AC-3 Access Enforcement; Group 2: AC-6 Least Privilege; Group 3: AC-2 Account Management). Regroup for
    teach-back sessions with Q&A, where experts explain application to archival scenarios and peers quiz them.'
  problem_solving: 'Real-world scenario: Design access controls for a financial firm''s WORM (Write Once Read Many) archive
    compliant with SEC Rule 17a-4. Create a role-based access matrix specifying permissions for roles (e.g., Archivist, Auditor,
    Compliance Officer), incorporating RBAC/ABAC, least privilege, and auditing. Present and justify against CIA triad violations.'
