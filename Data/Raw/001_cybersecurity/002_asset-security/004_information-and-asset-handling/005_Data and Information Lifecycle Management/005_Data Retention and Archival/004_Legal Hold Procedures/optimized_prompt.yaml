active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the threshold for 'reasonably anticipated' litigation. Using real-world examples like a customer
    data breach complaint escalating to a lawsuit or a regulatory subpoena, argue when a legal hold should be triggered and
    the consequences of delaying it.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    design: 'Plausible errors based on common misconceptions: e.g., for trigger – ''Only after lawsuit filing'' (wrong, it''s
      anticipated); ''No duty without subpoena'' (wrong, includes threats); ''Preserve all data forever'' (wrong, targeted
      ESI). Use partial truths, opposites, or irrelevant details. Ensure distractors promote analysis.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in CISSP-aligned topics. Generate
  50 high-quality flashcards on ''Legal Hold Procedures'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and
  Asset Handling > Data and Information Lifecycle Management > Data Retention and Archival > Legal Hold Procedures).


  **Core Content (Synthesized from Sedona Conference and best practices):** Legal hold suspends data disposition when litigation
  is anticipated. Duty to preserve triggers on notice of lawsuit, subpoena, complaint, counsel advice, or inquiry. Key steps:
  trigger ID, notify/issue holds, identify custodians/ESI (emails, docs, logs, DBs), suspend deletions, preserve immutably,
  monitor, release post-resolution. Risks: spoliation sanctions. Best practices: training, automation, documentation.


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s Taxonomy):** [Insert full list from ''learning_objectives'' above].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full descriptions from ''scaffolding'' above].


  **Active Learning Ties:** Link cards to [discussion_prompt], [peer_teaching_activity], [problem_solving_exercise] where
  relevant.


  **Output Format (Strict JSON Array):** [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'':
  ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''active_learning_link'': ''...'', ''sources'': ''...''}}, ...]


  **Flashcard Rules:** Follow ''flashcard_schema'' exactly. Ensure MCQs have 1 correct + 3 distractors (plausible via protocol).
  Balance coverage: objectives, layers, hierarchy. Promote active recall, higher-order thinking. No duplicates; vary formats.'
