active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Should PIAs be mandatory for all data collection activities, or only triggered by specific risks? Debate
    using jurisdictional differences (e.g., GDPR's high-risk processing requirements vs. CCPA's general guidelines vs. OAIC's
    risk-based approach). Support arguments with real-world examples and consider impacts on innovation vs. privacy protection.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Plausible but incorrect: Common misconceptions (e.g., ''PIA only for government'' vs. all orgs).'
    - Jurisdictional variations (e.g., GDPR-mandated vs. risk-based).
    - Partial truths (e.g., PII excludes anonymized data – but can be re-identified).
    - Avoid obvious errors; base on research (e.g., mix PII/sensitive definitions).
