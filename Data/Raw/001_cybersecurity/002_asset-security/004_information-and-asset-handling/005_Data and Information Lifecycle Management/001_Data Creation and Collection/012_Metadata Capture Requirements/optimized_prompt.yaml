  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: Students pair up; one explains CM-8 System Component Inventory requirements to their partner using examples
    of metadata fields (e.g., asset type, origin, configuration), then switch roles with a teach-back quiz to reinforce understanding.
  problem_solving: Present a real-world scenario (e.g., SolarWinds supply chain breach). Groups identify missing metadata
    that could have mitigated risks and propose a capture protocol linked to NIST SP 800-161, encouraging application to C-SCRM.

    (e.g., confuse metadata with data itself); (2) Outdated/misapplied standards (e.g., wrong NIST control); (3) Extreme opposites
    (e.g., ''no metadata needed'' vs. comprehensive capture); (4) Context-shifted (e.g., privacy-only focus ignoring security).
    Explain on Back why distractors are incorrect.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Asset Security. Topic:
  Metadata Capture Requirements (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and Asset Handling > Data and Information
  Lifecycle Management > Data Creation and Collection > Metadata Capture Requirements). Use the following to generate high-quality,
  pedagogically optimized flashcards:


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full learning_objectives array here].


  **Active Learning Components:** Incorporate references to [discussion], [peer_teaching], [problem_solving] in explanations
  where relevant.


  **Scaffolding Layers:** Distribute flashcards across layers: 25% Layer 1 (Foundation), 25% Layer 2 (Components), 25% Layer
  3 (Implementation), 25% Layer 4 (Integration). Prefix questions with layer (e.g., ''Layer 1: Define...''). Use provided
  content: Complete NIST IR 7693 (asset identification specs for known identifiers: unique ID, provenance, config state);
  Sources: NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final), NIST IR 7693 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/ir/7693/final),
  NIST SP 800-161 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/161/r1/final).


  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly follow [flashcard_schema]. Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'':
  ''...'', ''type'': ''MCQ|Cloze|Short'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''1-4'', ''reference'': ''...''}]. Ensure variety,
  voter consensus (82.9% approval), and web-grounded context (assets, C-SCRM). Prioritize measurable outcomes and active recall.'
