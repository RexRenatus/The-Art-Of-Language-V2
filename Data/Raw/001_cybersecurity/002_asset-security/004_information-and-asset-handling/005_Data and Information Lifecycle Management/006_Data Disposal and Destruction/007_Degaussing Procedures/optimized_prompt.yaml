active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the effectiveness of degaussing versus overwriting or physical destruction for different media
    types (e.g., HDDs vs. SSDs). Consider factors like coercivity, compliance with NSA/CSS standards and EPL, cost, environmental
    impact, and misconceptions about non-magnetic media. Which method is optimal in a high-security enterprise scenario disposing
    of legacy HDDs with PII?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    on SSDs'' as distractor for media types; ''Multiple passes required'' vs. single pass; outdated standards like NIST 800-53
    instead of 800-88; low Gauss ratings for high-coercivity media). Ensure distractors are web-grounded (e.g., from NSA EPL
    errors) and teach why wrong in explanations.'

  Incorporate this research context: Degaussing uses a strong fluctuating magnetic field to randomize magnetic domains on
  HDDs/tapes, based on coercivity. Key standards: NSA/CSS Policy 9-12 (media sanitization), EPL (approved degaussers, e.g.,
  >30,000 Gauss for high-coercivity), NIST SP 800-88 (verification). Irreversible; inoperates media. Sources: https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/70/documents/resources/everyone/digital-media-sanitization.pdf,
