active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the misconception that physical shredding alone is sufficient for all media types (e.g., HDDs
    requiring degaussing or pulverization). Discuss how NIST SP 800-88 addresses this and implications for third-party vetting
    in a healthcare context.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truth (e.g., ''ISO 27001 without NAID''); 3) Irrelevant/outdated standard (e.g., ''HIPAA instead of NIST for
    media''). Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter-noted pitfalls.'

  Third-Party Destruction Service Vetting (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and Asset Handling > Data
  and Information Lifecycle Management > Data Disposal and Destruction > Third-Party Destruction Service Vetting).


  Expanded Research Context: Vetting ensures secure disposal of assets with sensitive data. Core standards: NIST SP 800-88
  (media sanitization: clear, purge, destroy methods); UK GDPR/ICO (third-party contracts, accountability); 36 CFR Part 1226
  (NARA: destruction of temporary federal records, refs NIST 800-88, ISO/IEC 15408); NAID AAA (certified destruction processes,
  chain-of-custody); ADISA (secure asset disposal); ISO 27001 (vendor ISMS). Vetting criteria: certifications, SLAs, audits,
  insurance, references, certs of destruction. Misconceptions: Shredding for all media; no chain-of-custody.
