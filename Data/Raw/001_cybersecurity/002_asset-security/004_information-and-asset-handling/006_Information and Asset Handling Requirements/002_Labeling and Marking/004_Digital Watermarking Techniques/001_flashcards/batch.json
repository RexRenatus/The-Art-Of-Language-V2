        "core_logic": "Hard bindings use cryptographic hashes of the asset's content to create a direct, tamper-evident link to its manifest.

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Designing a digital watermark involves balancing competing requirements: robustness (resistance to attacks), capacity (amount of data embedded), and imperceptibility (maintaining media quality). Often, enhancing one property, like robustness, requires embedding more data or altering the media more significantly, which can reduce imperceptibility because the embedding process itself can introduce detectable changes.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The core trade-off is between robustness/capacity and imperceptibility. While capacity and robustness can be inversely related, and imperceptibility and robustness are often inversely related, the primary challenge is balancing all three.",
