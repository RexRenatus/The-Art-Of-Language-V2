  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between strict Australian Government Email Protective Marking
    standards and more flexible NIST SP 800-177 guidelines. Which is better for multinational organizations and why? Support
    with examples of potential data spills.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 2-4 plausible distractors for MCQs based on: 1. Common misconceptions (e.g., marking only
    subject line); 2. Confusing similar standards (e.g., Australian ''OFFICIAL'' vs. U.S. ''UNCLASSIFIED''); 3. Over/under-classification
    errors; 4. Real-world pitfalls (e.g., ignoring attachments). Ensure distractors promote analysis.'
