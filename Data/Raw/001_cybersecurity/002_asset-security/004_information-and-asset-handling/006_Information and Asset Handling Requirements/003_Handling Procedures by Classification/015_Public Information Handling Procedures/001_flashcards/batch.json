        "core_logic": "Monitoring and limiting unsuccessful logon attempts is vital because excessive failures can indicate a brute-force attack aiming to guess credentials, since attackers systematically try combinations. This procedure works by enforcing limits on failed attempts and locking accounts or systems, thereby deterring and preventing unauthorized access.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors misrepresent the primary risk by focusing on server load, accidental lockouts, or tracking difficulties, rather than the core security threat of brute-force or credential stuffing attacks.",
        "analogy": "Limiting failed logon attempts is like having a security guard who stops letting people try keys after a few failed attempts to prevent someone from picking the lock."
