active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges of maintaining physical asset inventories in OT environments
    (e.g., legacy hardware in manufacturing) compared to IT. Reference CISA guidance and propose solutions tied to defensible
    architecture. Cite voter consensus on progressive complexity.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 1 plausible misconception (e.g., confuse passive/active discovery).
    - 1 partial truth (e.g., valid IT step, invalid for OT).
    - 1 opposite/extreme (e.g., 'Skip manual verification').
    - 1 unrelated (e.g., from vuln mgmt).
    - Ensure 4 options total; randomize order.
    count_per_card: 20-30 cards per layer, balanced across Bloom's levels.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Physical Asset Inventory
  Management (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and Asset Handling > Asset Identification and
  Classification > Asset Inventory and Discovery > Physical Asset Inventory Management). Use the provided learning_objectives,
  active_learning components, scaffolding_layers (4 layers with concept map), and flashcard_schema to create optimized Anki-style
  flashcards.


  Context: Build on voter consensus (82.9% approval): Complete ISA/IEC 62443 (IACS security standards emphasizing asset discovery),
  progressive complexity, pedagogy via Bloom''s. Research: OT focus, CISA guidance (full link), NIST CSF ID.AM.


  Incorporate active learning by embedding discussion/peer/problem-solving hooks in 20% of explanations. Scaffold cards by
  layer (tag each: Layer1_Foundation, etc.).


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"front": "Question with 4 MC options", "back": {"correct": "Letter)
  Answer", "explanation": "Full rationale + source + Bloom''s tie-in + layer + concept_map_link", "objectives": ["APPLY"],
  "tags": ["Layer3", "CISA"]}}. Generate 80-100 cards balanced per schema. Ensure distractors follow protocol. Prioritize
  high-fidelity recall for OT vs IT distinctions.'
