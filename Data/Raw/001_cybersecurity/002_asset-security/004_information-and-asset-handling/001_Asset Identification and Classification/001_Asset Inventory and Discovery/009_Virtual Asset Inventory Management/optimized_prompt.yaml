active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, explain VASP activities (e.g., exchange, transfer, safekeeping) to each other using real examples
    like Binance or Coinbase, then switch roles and quiz on distinctions from non-VASP entities.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A firm discovers rogue crypto wallets via anomalous transactions. Design a discovery and classification
    process, including tools (e.g., blockchain analytics), classification (VA vs. non-VA), and remediation steps.'

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors that are: 1) Semantically similar (e.g., IT virtual assets like containers for
    VA questions). 2) Based on voter-noted confusions (FATF crypto vs. VMs/OT). 3) Plausible real-world errors (e.g., including
    securities as VAs). 4) One ''too broad/narrow'', one ''opposite'', one ''unrelated but sounds technical''. Ensure 20-30%
    flashcards test distinctions.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Asset Security. Topic:
  Virtual Asset Inventory Management (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and Asset Handling > Asset Identification
  and Classification > Asset Inventory and Discovery > Virtual Asset Inventory Management). Focus on FATF-defined VAs (crypto/digital
  value, e.g., Bitcoin; exclude fiat/securities) and VASPs, distinguishing from IT virtual assets (VMs/containers) or OT to
  avoid confusion. Draw from research: VA inventory tracks holdings, wallets, transactions; VASP activities: exchange fiat/VA,
  VA transfers, safekeeping; integrate CIS Control 1 (Inventory Enterprise Assets, adapted for VAs: continuous discovery,
  classification). Best practices: blockchain tools, CMDB, SIEM integration, automation.
