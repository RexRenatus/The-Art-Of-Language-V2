        "core_logic": "The MAC address is valuable in an asset inventory because its structure often encodes the manufacturer of the network interface card (NIC). This information aids in identifying hardware and can be used in conjunction with other attributes for asset discovery and management.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly claim MAC addresses guarantee security, assign IP addresses, or are globally unique across all networks, rather than their primary utility in identifying the network card manufacturer.",
        "analogy": "A MAC address is like the serial number on a specific component (like a car's engine); it helps identify the manufacturer of that component and can be used for tracking."
