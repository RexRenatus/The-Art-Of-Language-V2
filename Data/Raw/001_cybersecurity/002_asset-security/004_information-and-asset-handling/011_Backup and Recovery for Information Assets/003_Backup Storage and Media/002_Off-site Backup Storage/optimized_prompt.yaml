active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a scenario where a company's data center is hit by a flood, debate the advantages and risks of off-site
    backups versus on-site replication. Consider factors like recovery time objective (RTO), recovery point objective (RPO),
    and compliance with NIST CSF Recover function.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
  additional_activities:
  - Think-pair-share on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Off-site backups don't need encryption').
  - Role-playing a DR team simulating a cyberattack recovery using off-site backups.
  - Collaborative project to classify backup media reusability per NIST guidelines.

    needs''), 2) Related but incorrect concept (e.g., mix-up with on-site replication), 3) Partial truth exaggerated (e.g.,
    ''Cloud is always cheaper without security trade-offs''). Ensure plausible to educated learners but identifiable errors.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  using Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, and scaffolding. Generate high-quality, optimized flashcards for the topic ''Off-site
  Backup Storage'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and Asset Handling > Backup and Recovery
  for Information Assets > Backup Storage and Media > Off-site Backup Storage).


  Incorporate this research context: Off-site backup storage protects data from localized disasters, cyberattacks, or failures
  by storing copies geographically separate from primary sources. Core concepts: Data Backup (copies for restoration), Off-site
  Backup (distinct location), DR (resume operations post-event), BC (continue services). NIST CSF: Recover function (restoration
  plans), Govern (risk oversight), interlinks with Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond. NIST SP 800-34: Contingency planning emphasizing
  off-site for recoverability. NIST SP 800-53: Media protection controls. Key factors: RTO (time to recover), RPO (data loss
  tolerance). Implementation: Cloud/physical, encryption (AES-256), testing. Compliance: HIPAA. Examples: Colonial Pipeline
  ransomware.
