active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between frequent partial integrity checks (e.g., checksums)
    and infrequent full restores in a ransomware scenario. How do these align with RTO/RPO, and what risks arise if testing
    is skipped? Reference NIST RC.RP-03.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
