      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 CP-9(8) mandates cryptographic protection for backup information because it ensures confidentiality and integrity by encrypting data and using digital signatures, thereby preventing unauthorized disclosure and modification. This functions by applying mathematical algorithms to secure the data content, connecting to the fundamental principles of data security.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The first distractor confuses cryptography with storage location. The second confuses it with data lifecycle management. The third confuses it with performance optimization.",
        "analogy": "CP-9(8) is like using a secret code (cryptography) to write your backup notes, ensuring that even if someone finds them, they can't read or alter the information without the key."
