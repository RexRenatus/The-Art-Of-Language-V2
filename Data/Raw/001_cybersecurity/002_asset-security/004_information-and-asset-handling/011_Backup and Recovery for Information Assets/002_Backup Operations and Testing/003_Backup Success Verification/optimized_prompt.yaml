  Prior Knowledge: Builds on data backups, RTO/RPO basics.


  Use this synthesized content:

  [Foundation] Definitions: Backup, Restoration Asset, Integrity, Availability, RTO, RPO.

  [Components] NIST CSF 2.0 RC.RP-03; NIST SP 800-53 CP-2/CP-4; AWS Well-Architected Reliability REL09-BP04: Perform periodic
  restore testing to ensure backups are complete, uncorrupted, and restorable.

  [Implementation] Steps: Checksums, metadata checks, test restores, automation.

  [Integration] Automation, RTO/RPO optimization, ransomware cases.
