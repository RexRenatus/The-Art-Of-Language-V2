  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Routine restore testing is unnecessary if backups are
    automated and stored offsite.'' Use RTO/RPO metrics, NIST guidelines, and real-world ransomware examples to support your
    position. Identify common misconceptions such as ''Backups are always restorable without testing.'''
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Generate\
  \ 25 high-quality flashcards on 'Restore Testing Procedures' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information\
  \ and Asset Handling > Backup and Recovery for Information Assets > Backup Operations and Testing > Restore Testing Procedures).\
  \ \n\nIncorporate these elements:\n- Learning Objectives: [insert full list from above]\n- Active Learning: Inspire critical\
  \ thinking via subtle scenario ties.\n- Scaffolding Layers: [insert full descriptions from above] – Ensure coverage.\n-\
  \ Voter Priorities: Completeness (full best practices), pedagogy (Bloom's progression), accuracy (NIST SP 1800-11 at https://csrc.nist.gov).\n\
  - Research: Emphasize ransomware recovery, data integrity validation.\n\nUse exact Flashcard Schema: Each card as JSON object\
  \ with 'front', 'back', 'explanation', 'bloom_level', 'scaffolding_layer', 'distractors' (array of 3 for MCQs). Balance:\
  \ 30% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND (Layer 1-2), 40% APPLY/ANALYZE (Layer 2-3), 30% EVALUATE/CREATE (Layer 3-4). Vary: 12 MCQs (with\
