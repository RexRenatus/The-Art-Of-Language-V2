active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare the ideal RPO for a financial institution (e.g., 5 minutes for transaction data) versus an e-commerce
    platform (e.g., 1 hour for inventory) during a cyberattack. What factors (e.g., regulatory requirements, revenue impact,
    data volatility) influence these choices, and how do they shape backup strategies? Debate in groups and propose hybrid
    approaches.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL ARRAY FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE] (inspire scenario cards)

  - Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL PRIOR_KNOWLEDGE + LAYERS FROM ABOVE] (tag cards by layer)

  - Research Context: RPO = max data loss time (e.g., Huntress/TechTarget); ties to backup freq, data tolerance; RTO = recovery
  time; examples (financial:5min); BIA for setting; replication for 0 RPO.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards per the schema: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD_SCHEMA FROM ABOVE].

  Ensure: Bloom''s progression, voter priorities (RTO comparison, examples, concept map), active recall (no pure lists), distractors
  for MCQs. Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards. No extra text.'
