  discussion_prompt: In a mid-sized company with tight budgets, debate whether to prioritize NIST SP 800-88 data sanitization
    or R2 environmental standards when disposing of e-waste. Support arguments with real-world risks like data breaches vs.
    regulatory fines and ecological harm. This addresses misconceptions that data wiping alone suffices and encourages critical
    thinking on trade-offs.
  peer_teaching: 'Pair students; Partner A explains data sanitization methods (Clear: overwrite; Purge: degauss/encrypt erase;
    Destroy: physical) from NIST SP 800-88 and chain of custody to Partner B, who performs a teach-back by summarizing and
    quizzing A. Switch roles for R2 (focuses on env protection, data security, worker health) vs. e-Stewards (prevents export
    to unsafe countries) standards.'
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: Your organization must dispose of 500 retired laptops containing PII. Design a compliant ITAD
    process including sanitization per NIST SP 800-88, chain of custody, R2/e-Stewards certified vendor selection, cost-benefit
    analysis, and documentation for RCRA compliance. Present risks of non-compliance (e.g., fines, breaches, env harm).'
  additional_activities:
  - Think-pair-share on misconceptions (e.g., 'Is simple file deletion secure? Why not? Discuss overwriting vs. physical destruction.')
  - 'Role-playing: Students simulate an ITAD audit—one acts as auditor, others as vendor defending processes against data
    security and RCRA gaps.'
  - 'Group simulation: Track a mock asset''s chain of custody from inventory to disposal, identifying potential breach points.'

  **Use Exactly These Elements**:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the array above]

  - Active Learning: Incorporate concepts from prompts/activities into explanations (e.g., trade-offs, misconceptions like
  deletion ≠ sanitization).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards: 25% Layer1, 25% Layer2, 30% Layer3, 20% Layer4. Cover all content.

  - Bloom''s Coverage: Even distribution across 6 levels.

  - Generate 25 high-quality flashcards (18 MCQ, 7 basic Q&A).


  **Full Topic Content**: [paste scaffolding layers verbatim] + Core: ITAD ensures data security + env compliance; risks:
  breaches (e.g., 2017 Navy laptop scandal), RCRA fines ($100K/day), toxics leaching.


  **Output**: JSON array of flashcards strictly following the schema. No extra text. Ensure active recall, spaced repetition
  optimization (varied phrasing), distractors per protocol.'
