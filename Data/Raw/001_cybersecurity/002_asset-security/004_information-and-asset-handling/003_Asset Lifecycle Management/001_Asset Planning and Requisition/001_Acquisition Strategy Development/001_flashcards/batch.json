        "core_logic": "Supplier Risk Assessment Capabilities directly involve evaluating the supplier's internal security posture. This includes assessing their cybersecurity protections, known vulnerabilities, and overall integrity practices, as these directly impact the security of the products and services they provide.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors focus on irrelevant financial, HR, or commercial aspects of the supplier, rather than the critical C-SCRM risk factors related to their internal security and integrity practices.",
        "analogy": "Assessing a supplier's internal security practices is like checking a restaurant's kitchen hygiene – you look at their food safety protocols and pest control (cybersecurity, integrity), not their advertising campaigns (marketing budget) or customer reviews (satisfaction surveys)."
