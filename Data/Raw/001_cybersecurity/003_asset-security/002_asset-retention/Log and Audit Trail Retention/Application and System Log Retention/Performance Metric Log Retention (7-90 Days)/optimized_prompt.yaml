active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of retaining performance metric logs for 7 days versus 90 days in a cloud environment
    with limited storage. Consider cost implications, incident detection windows (e.g., average time to detect DDoS via CPU
    spikes), compliance requirements, and forensic value.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''1 year'' instead
    of 7-90 days, assuming all logs need long retention). 2) Edge cases (e.g., ''1-7 days'' too short, ''90-365 days'' confuses
    with security logs). 3) Real-world variations (e.g., PCI-DSS 3 months vs. operational 30 days). Ensure distractors teach
    by contrast.'
