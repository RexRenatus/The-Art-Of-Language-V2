active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using purely incremental backups versus a hybrid full+incremental
    strategy in a high-threat environment like ransomware attacks. Consider impacts on RPO/RTO, storage costs, and recovery
    chain integrity. Use real-world examples from NIST or PCI DSS to support arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors from: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Incrementals only since full backup''
    vs. correct ''since last backup''). 2) Partial truths (e.g., ''GFS: 7 daily fulls'' vs. ''incrementals''). 3) Edge cases
    (e.g., ignore RTO in RPO-focused Q). 4) Confusable terms (retention policy vs. schedule; RPO vs. RTO). Ensure plausible
    for mid-level learners.'

  Generate 75 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema. Integrate:

  - **Learning Objectives** (span Bloom''s: Remember/Understand, Apply/Analyze, Evaluate/Create as listed).

  - **Scaffolding Layers** (Layer1 Foundation, Layer2 Components, Layer3 Implementation, Layer4 Integration; 20% cards per
  layer).

  - **Active Learning** (Incorporate discussion/peer/problem-solving elements into explanations or scenario-based Qs).

  - **Content Completeness**: Include GFS examples (7 daily inc., 4 weekly fulls, 12 monthly fulls), 3-2-1 rule, misconceptions
  (inc. only since full? No; retention=schedule? No), standards (ISO27001 A.12.3, NIST SP800-53 CP-9/RA-5, PCI DSS v4 Req.9/10
  1yr retention, GDPR Art.5, SOX 7yrs), tools (Veeam/Bacula), RPO/RTO calcs, ransomware context.

  - **Sources**: NIST SP800-53, ISO27001:2022, PCI DSS v4.0, GDPR, SOX, Veeam Best Practices Guide.


  **Flashcard Schema**:

  - Q: Multiple-choice (1 correct, 3 distractors per protocol) or short-answer/cloze.

  - A: Correct answer + explanation (why correct/wrong distractors, link to objective/layer/activity, cite source).

  - Tags: [Bloom: e.g., Analyze] [Layer: e.g., 3] [Hierarchy: Level6]

  - Balance: 30% basic recall, 30% apply/analyze, 20% evaluate, 20% create/scenarios.

  - Visuals: Suggest diagrams (e.g., GFS pyramid) in 20% Qs.
