  **Context:** Fits in Cybersecurity domain to balance security, compliance, efficiency; minimizes post-retention breach risks.
  Prerequisites: Basic backups, data classification. Sources: NIST SP 800-88 (Clear: overwrite; Purge: degauss/degauss/overwrite
  for infeasible recovery; Destroy: shred/incinerate), delaware.gov guidelines (RPO, RTO, archiving, retention schedules),
  HIPAA/GDPR.


  **Pedagogy:** Use provided learning_objectives (span Bloom''s: remember to create), active_learning_components (inspire
  questions on debates/trade-offs), scaffolding_layers (tag each card). Ensure measurable outcomes.


  **Output:** JSON array of flashcards, e.g., [{''question'': ''...'', ''correct_answer'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [{''text'':
  ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...''}...], ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...''}...].
  Strictly follow flashcard_generation_schema: snake_case, exactly 3 distractors with text/explanation, distractor_protocol.


  Generate comprehensive set covering all layers/objectives, integrating voter consensus (completeness on NIST, pedagogy scaffolding).'
