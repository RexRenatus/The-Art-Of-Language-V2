  discussion_prompt: 'Given limited storage and strict RTO/RPO (e.g., RTO=2hrs, RPO=4hrs), debate optimal retention for differential
    vs. incremental backups: longer retention for faster restore or shorter to save costs? Use think-pair-share protocol.'

  distractor_protocol: '3 distractors per MCQ: (1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Differential copies changes since last differential''
    - confuses with incremental), (2) Extreme value (e.g., ''Retain forever'' vs. realistic 7-14 days), (3) Reversed concept
    (e.g., ''Slower restore than incrementals''). Ensure plausible, derived from research context.'

  **Topic Hierarchy:** Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Retention > Backup and Archive Retention > Backup Retention
  Strategy > Differential Backup Retention Schedules.


  **Research Context:** [Full summary provided] Differential Backup: Copies all changes since last FULL backup (grows larger
  over time). Retention Schedule: Defines retention (e.g., 7-14 daily differentials + weekly fulls per NIST-aligned practices).
  Standards: NIST SP 800-39 (risk mgmt), SP 800-53 (backup controls: CP-9, system backups; media protection). Best practices:
  Balance RTO (restore time, differentials faster than incremental chains), RPO (data loss), storage costs. Examples: Retain
  differentials 7 days (daily changes) until next full; HIPAA: Encrypt, retain per regs. Sources: NIST.gov/sp800-39, sp800-53;
  Delaware Data Backup Guidelines (state archives).


  **Prior Knowledge:** Assumes familiarity with full backups, incremental backups, general retention policies.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full array from above].


  **Scaffolding:** Generate flashcards across 4 layers: [Insert full scaffolding from above]. Aim for 30% Layer1, 25% Layer2,
  25% Layer3, 20% Layer4.


  **Active Learning Integration:** Include 2-3 flashcards prompting discussion/activities (e.g., ''Debate: ...'' front).


  **Flashcard Generation Rules:**

  - 20-30 cards total, balanced by Bloom''s (Remember/Understand:40%, Apply/Analyze:30%, Evaluate/Create:30%).

  - Types: 50% MCQ (4 opts), 30% Cloze, 20% Short Answer.

  - Follow exact [Flashcard Schema] above.

  - High-quality: University-level, active recall, spaced repetition friendly. No hints on front.

  - Voter Consensus: 82.9% approval; incorporate examples, calculations, critiques.


  Generate ONLY the JSON array of flashcards. No intro text.'
