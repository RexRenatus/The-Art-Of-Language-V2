active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between prioritizing Backup Success Rate versus RTO/RPO
    compliance in a high-stakes financial institution. Use NIST SP 800-55 metrics to support your arguments and propose a
    balanced reporting dashboard.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    incorrect term (e.g., ''restore failure rate'' vs. ''backup success rate''), 1 extreme value/outlier (e.g., 100% always
    success). Ensure no overlap with correct answer; base on real-world errors from NIST or industry reports.'

  **Content Foundation:** Use this synthesized, complete content:

  - Core Concepts: [Insert full Layer 1-4 details from scaffolding_layers above, including all NIST details, sources (SP 800-55
  Vol1: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/55/v1/final, Vol2: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/55/v2/final; SP 800-53 Rev5:
  https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final with CP-9/CP-10), steps, integrations]. Prior Knowledge: [From scaffolding].


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [List all 6 from above]. Ensure flashcards target these.

  - Scaffolding: Balance 10 cards per 4 layers.

  - Active Learning Tie-in: Weave prompts like ''How would you discuss this metric in a peer group?'' into explanations.


  **Generate Flashcards:** Create 40-50 MCQs following EXACT schema:

  [Full flashcard_schema structure above].

  Vary Bloom''s: 20% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 50% Evaluate/Create. Use voter priorities: completeness (full
  NIST/controls), pedagogy (measurable, active). Output ONLY as numbered list of flashcards, no intro/outro.'
