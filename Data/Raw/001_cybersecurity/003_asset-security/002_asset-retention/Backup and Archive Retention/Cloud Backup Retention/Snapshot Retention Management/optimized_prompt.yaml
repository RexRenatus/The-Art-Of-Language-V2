  **Prior Knowledge:** Assume learners know basic backups, data lifecycle, point-in-time recovery.


  **Research Context (Complete Summary):**

  Snapshot retention management controls lifecycle of point-in-time data copies for recovery, continuity, compliance. Core:
  Snapshot (point-in-time copy); Retention (policy duration); Balances costs, RTO/RPO, risks.

  - Ransomware defense: Recover pre-infection (NIST SP 1800-25: Data Integrity & Ransomware Protection - emphasizes air-gapped/immutable
  snapshots).

  - Confidentiality: Protect snapshot data (NIST SP 1800-29: Detecting Compromise of Data Confidentiality, including detection
  techniques; SP 1800-28: Endpoint Security Solution for Inventory & Management).

  - NIST SP 800-53: Media Protection (MP controls for sanitization/retention).

  Cloud: AWS EBS Snapshots (Lifecycle Policies: retain 7 days, archive to S3 Glacier, auto-delete); Azure Managed Disk Snapshots
  (retention tags/policies); GCP Persistent Disk Snapshots (lifecycle rules via Object Storage).
