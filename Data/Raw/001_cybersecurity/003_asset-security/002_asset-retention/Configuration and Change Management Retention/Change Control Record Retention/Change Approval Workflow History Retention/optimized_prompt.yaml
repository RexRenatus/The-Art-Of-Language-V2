  Topic: Change Approval Workflow History Retention (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Retention > Configuration
  and Change Management Retention > Change Control Record Retention > Change Approval Workflow History Retention). Category:
  Cybersecurity. Use this FULL research context:


  Maintaining detailed history of change approval workflows is critical for asset security, providing audit trails for IT
  changes. Definitions: Change Approval Workflow (stakeholder-reviewed process); History Retention (store requestor/reviewer/approver/timestamps/rationale);
  Asset Security (protect assets from unauthorized mods).


  Standards (completed/accurate): NIST CSF 2.0: GV.PO-07 (change control processes), PR.IP-3 equivalent (config change control),
  Detect DE.AE-05 (adverse event analysis using logs), DE.CM-01 (monitoring changes). NIST SP 800-53 Rev5: CM-3 (Configuration
  Change Control), AU-11 (Audit Record Retention: 3mos-12yrs based on impact). ISO/IEC 27001:2022 A.8.32 (Management of technical
  vulnerabilities incl. changes), A.12.1.2 equiv. CIS Controls v8: Control 7 (Continuous Vulnerability Management), Control
  13 (Security Awareness). Retention periods: 1-7 years (regs: SOX=7yrs financial, GDPR=relevant audits, HIPAA=6yrs). Tools:
  ServiceNow, Jira, Splunk. Sources: NIST.gov/cyberframework (CSF 2.0), csrc.nist.gov/800-53 (SP800-53r5), iso.org (27001),
  cisecurity.org/controls.

  Generate flashcards per EXACT schema: 30-50 cards, CSV format (Fields: Front,Back,Explanation,BloomLevel,Layer,Tags). Balance:
  20% Layer1/Remember-Understand, 30% Layer2-3/Apply-Analyze, 50% Layer4/Evaluate-Create. MCQ-heavy with distractor protocol.
  Embed active learning hints in explanations. Output ONLY the CSV table, no extras.'
