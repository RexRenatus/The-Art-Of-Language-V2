active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Should export controls on key materials prioritize national security over global technological collaboration?
    Use examples of deemed exports and High Performance Computers (HPCs) to argue your position, addressing misconceptions
    about 'dual-use' items.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors based on voter-noted misconceptions: e.g., confuse EAR with ITAR (military vs.
    dual-use), misstate ENC conditions (e.g., ignore 30-day review), overlook deemed exports as non-exports, swap CCL/ECCN
    roles, assume all encryption is license-free. Ensure 1-2 highly plausible (near-miss facts), 1 absurd.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Asset Security > Asset\
