active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of long vs. short retention periods for identity assertions and logs in hybrid
    clouds. Consider NIST SP 800-63C guidelines (e.g., minimum 1-3 years for audit logs), privacy laws like GDPR (data minimization),
    and incident response needs (e.g., forensic analysis post-breach). Support arguments with specific examples.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student draws and explains the identity federation flow (subscriber → IdP → CSP → RP) in a
    hybrid cloud setup, including retention points for assertions and logs. The partner then teaches back the associated retention
    policies per NIST SP 800-63C, correcting any errors.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A company uses an on-premises IdP (e.g., Active Directory Federation Services) federating with
    AWS as RP. Design a retention policy for assertions, authentication logs, and subscriber data ensuring NIST SP 800-63C
    compliance, while minimizing storage costs. Justify choices with references (e.g., AU-11 controls), propose secure deletion
    methods, and outline audit steps.'

  ## Hybrid Cloud Identity Federation Retention

  Core Concepts: Identity Federation (single credentials across domains via IdP assertions to RP); Hybrid Cloud (on-prem +
  public); Assertion (IdP statement on auth/attributes); Retention (storage duration for assertions/logs/subscriber data post-validity);
  CSP (proofing entity); IdP (issues assertions, e.g., on-prem); RP (consumes, e.g., AWS).

  NIST SP 800-63C (Federation and Assertions, completed per voters): Requires IdPs to retain issuance logs (events, timestamps,
  attributes) for min. periods aligned with SP 800-53 AU-11 (e.g., 1 year low-risk, 3-7 years high); RPs retain receipt/use
  logs; subscriber data per proofing level; distinguish from short validity (minutes-hours). Best practices: Encrypt storage,
  role-based access, secure deletion (NIST 800-88), audit trails. Hybrid challenges: Cross-domain sync, GDPR minimization.
