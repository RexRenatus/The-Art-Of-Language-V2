active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a multi-cloud environment, debate the pros and cons of relying on tagging versus cost categories for
    accurate cost allocation, considering scalability, compliance requirements (e.g., NIST, SOC2), and cybersecurity benefits
    like detecting unusual usage patterns indicative of breaches.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ from: (1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Tagging is only for
    resources, not costs''); (2) Partial truths (e.g., confuse CUR with basic billing console); (3) Related but wrong concepts
    (e.g., mix FinOps with DevOps); (4) Cybersecurity mislinks (e.g., retention only for finance, not audits). Ensure distractors
    teach by contrast.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Asset Security > Asset
  Retention > Cloud Infrastructure Retention > Cloud Cost Allocation and Usage Retention. Use the provided topic hierarchy
  (Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Retention > Cloud and Virtualization Asset Retention > Cloud Infrastructure Retention
  > Cloud Cost Allocation and Usage Retention), research context below, and pedagogical elements to create optimized flashcards.


  **Research Context:** [Insert full provided research summary here, completed for completeness: FinOps (finops.org/framework/):
  framework with principles (collaboration, accountability) and capabilities (allocation, optimization). CFM (AWS Well-Architected
  Cost Optimization Pillar). Cost Allocation via tagging (key-value pairs). Usage Retention: store CUR data for trends/anomalies
  (AWS: 14 months). Tie to cybersecurity: audit trails (NIST), compliance (SOC2, GDPR), breach detection via usage spikes.
  Sources: finops.org, aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/cost-optimization-pillar.pdf.]


  **Learning Objectives:** [Paste array above].

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Paste array above] – Generate 6-7 cards per layer, progressing from basic to advanced.

  **Active Learning:** Use as context (e.g., cards inspired by discussion prompts, exercises) to make cards discussion-ready.


  **Flashcard Generation Instructions:**

  - Cover all Bloom''s levels progressively per layer.

  - Ensure cybersecurity ties (e.g., retention for secure audits, anomaly detection).

  - Follow exact Flashcard Schema [paste schema above].

  - Total: 25 high-quality, unique cards. Vary difficulty, no repetition.

  - Output ONLY the list of flashcards in Markdown, no intro text.'
