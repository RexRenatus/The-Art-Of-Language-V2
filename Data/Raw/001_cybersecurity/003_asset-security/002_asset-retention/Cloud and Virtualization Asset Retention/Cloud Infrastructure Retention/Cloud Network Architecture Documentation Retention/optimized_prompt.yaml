active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the consequences of poor cloud network architecture documentation retention
    using the Capital One AWS breach (2019) as a case study. How could better retention have improved incident response and
    forensics? Connect to NIST SP 800-201 and propose preventive measures.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truth (e.g., wrong retention period like 1 month vs. 1-7 years), 3) Related but irrelevant (e.g., mix NIST
    800-53 with 800-145 control). Base on research context, voter suggestions, and real standards to avoid misinformation.'

  Retention -> Cloud Infrastructure Retention -> Cloud Network Architecture Documentation Retention.


  **Topic Hierarchy:** Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Retention > Cloud and Virtualization Asset Retention > Cloud
  Infrastructure Retention > Cloud Network Architecture Documentation Retention.


  **Research Context (Complete Summary):** Cloud network architecture: VPCs/VNets/subnets/firewalls/routing. Documentation:
  Diagrams/configs/policies. Retention: 1-7 years for audits/IR. NIST SP 800-145: ''Cloud computing is a model for enabling
  ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources...''. Models: IaaS/PaaS/SaaS;
  Public/Private/Hybrid/Community. NIST 800-53: AR-5 (retention), SC-28 (protections). NIST 800-201: Forensics needs docs.
  Others: FedRAMP/CMMC/CISA/DoD. Tools: AWS Config, Azure Policy, Lucidchart/Visio/Git/Terraform. Case: Capital One AWS breach
  (poor docs hindered IR). Sources: NIST 800-145 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf),
  800-53 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final), 800-201 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-201.pdf),
  FedRAMP (https://www.fedramp.gov/), CMMC (https://www.acq.osd.mil/cmmc/), CISA (https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cloud-computing).


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Use provided learning objectives (Bloom''s: Remember/Understand/Apply/Analyze/Evaluate/Create),
  active learning (discussion/peer-teach/problem-solve), scaffolding (4 layers: Foundation/Components/Implementation/Integration),
  prior knowledge (cloud models/asset classification).


  **Generate 25-30 flashcards** using the exact schema: Mix types (Basic Q&A 30%, MCQ 30%, Application 20%, Cloze 20%). Balance:
  25% per scaffold layer, span all Bloom''s. Follow distractor protocol strictly. Every card MUST have explanation, Bloom''s
  tag, layer, source.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects in the specified format. No extra text.'
