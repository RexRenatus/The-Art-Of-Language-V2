active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a serverless environment processing sensitive customer data (e.g., PII in an e-commerce FaaS app),
    what retention period for invocation logs would you recommend, and why? Debate using NIST CSF Detect/Respond functions,
    ISO 27001 A.12.4 logging requirements, and trade-offs with storage costs and privacy regulations like GDPR.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
