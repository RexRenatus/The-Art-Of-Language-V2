  Incorporate these exactly:

  - **Learning Objectives**: [Paste the full learning_objectives array here].

  - **Active Learning**: Use discussion/peer/problem-solving to inspire applied Qs (e.g., scenario-based MCQs).

  - **Scaffolding Layers**: Distribute cards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4.

  - **Content Details**: DIN 66399 P-1 to P-7 as in layers; big picture (CIA confidentiality, asset lifecycle); prior knowledge
  (data classification); regulations (GDPR/HIPAA); cross-cut vs. strip-cut.


  Follow **Flashcard Schema** strictly:

  - Output as JSON array of 50 objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'':
  ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''hints'': ''...''}, ''metadata'': {...}, ''type'': ''MCQ/Cloze/Short Answer''}]

  - 60% MCQ (4 options, 1 correct), 20% Cloze, 20% Short Answer.

  - Distractors per protocol.

  - Balance Bloom''s: 2 per objective.

  - Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition, misconceptions addressed.


  Prioritize voter consensus: full P-levels, scenarios, compliance. Make engaging, accurate, no fluff.'
