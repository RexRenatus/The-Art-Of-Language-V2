  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, Student A explains volatile vs. non-volatile memory sanitization and common misconceptions (e.g.,
    'RAM data disappears instantly'), while Student B teaches NIST SP 800-88 methods for volatile media (Clear via power removal,
    Purge limitations). Switch roles, then quiz each other on key differences and tools like memtest86.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A hospital workstation holding patient data in RAM must be transferred to another facility.
    Design a sanitization checklist including volatile memory steps (power removal, verification), NIST compliance, cold boot
    mitigations, and integration with full system decommissioning. Present and peer-review solutions.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Asset Security. Topic:
  RAM and Volatile Memory Clearing (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Retention > Data Sanitization and Destruction
  > Media-Specific Sanitization > RAM and Volatile Memory Clearing).


  Core Content (from NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 2 and research): Volatile memory (RAM) loses data on power removal (''Clear'' method).
  Risks: Cold boot attacks (residual retention). Purge (overwrite) for live systems; Destroy/Purge not typically applicable.
  Cryptographic Erase: For non-volatile. Tools: memtest86, RAM scrubbers. Misconceptions: Instant clearing.
