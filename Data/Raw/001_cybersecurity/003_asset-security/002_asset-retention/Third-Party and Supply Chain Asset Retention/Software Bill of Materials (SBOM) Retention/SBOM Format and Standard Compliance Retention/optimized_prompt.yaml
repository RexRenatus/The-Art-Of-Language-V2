  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between SPDX and CycloneDX formats for SBOM retention in
    a large-scale supply chain. Consider interoperability, tool support, and compliance with CISA mandates. Support arguments
    with NTIA minimum elements and real-world examples like Log4j vulnerability response.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    wrong NTIA element); 2) Common misconception (e.g., SBOM only lists top-level components); 3) Confusable alternative (e.g.,
    SPDX vs. CycloneDX specifics). Ensure distractors promote analysis.'
