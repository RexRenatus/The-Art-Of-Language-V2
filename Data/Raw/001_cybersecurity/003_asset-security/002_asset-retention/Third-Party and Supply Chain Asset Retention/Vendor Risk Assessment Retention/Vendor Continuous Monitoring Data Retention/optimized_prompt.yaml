active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a debate format, argue for or against a mandatory 7-year retention period for vendor continuous monitoring
    data. Cite NIST SP 800-53 AU-11 (Audit Record Retention), real-world breaches like SolarWinds, and regulatory trade-offs
    (e.g., GDPR minimization vs. audit needs). Groups of 3-4 debate, then vote and reflect on consensus.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    ''1-year retention (underestimates audit needs)'', ''Indefinite (ignores GDPR minimization)'', ''Post-incident only (misconception
    vs. continuous)''. Base on voter-noted misconceptions, similar controls (e.g., confuse AU-11 with AU-2), or real-world
    variances (e.g., SOC 2 vs. NIST periods). Ensure 1-2 highly tempting distractors.'

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Bloom''s Objectives: [insert full array from ''learning_objectives''].

  - Active Learning: Use for context/explanations [insert summaries from ''active_learning''].

  - Scaffolding: Generate flashcards progressively across 4 layers [insert full ''scaffolding'' content]. Ensure coverage:
  25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4.

  - Research Context: Core concepts (definitions from provided summary); NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 (AU-11: retain audit records
  per policy; SA-4: security in acquisitions; SA-9: monitor external services; full SA family for acquired systems and services);
  Other frameworks: ISO 27001 (A.18.1.3 records mgmt), SOC 2 (CC3.4 retention), GDPR (Art 5(1)(e)); Sources: NIST 800-53r5
  (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r5), NIST 800-161 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-161r1), ISO 27001 (https://www.iso.org/standard/82875.html).


  Generate flashcards per exact schema [insert full ''flashcard_schema'']. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, e.g., [{''type'':...,
  ''front'':..., ''back'':{...}, ''tags'':[...]}, ...]. Ensure variety, high-quality distractors, comprehensive coverage of
  objectives/layers/standards. Prioritize active recall, spaced repetition best practices.'
