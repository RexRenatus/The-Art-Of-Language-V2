  discussion_prompt: 'In a supply chain attack like SolarWinds, how would inadequate third-party API log retention hinder
    incident response? Debate optimal retention periods (e.g., NIST CSF Detect alignment: 90-365 days minimum) balancing compliance
    requirements (GDPR, SOC 2) against storage costs, considering log fields like requester IP, endpoint, and outcome.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Logs only for internal APIs'');
    2) Confused term/framework (e.g., GDPR retention as ''indefinite''); 3) Extreme value (e.g., ''7 days'' vs. ''1 year'').
    Ensure distractors are realistic from research (e.g., wrong retention periods like 30 days).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 15 high-quality flashcards on ''Third-Party API Access Log Retention''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Retention > Third-Party and Supply Chain Asset Retention > Vendor
  Access and Activity Retention > Third-Party API Access Log Retention). Voter consensus: 100% approval on pedagogy and completeness
  enhancements.


  Incorporate this research context: Core concepts (API, Third-Party API, Access Log fields: IP/timestamp/endpoint/user-agent/outcome,
  Log Retention). Standards: NIST CSF 2.0 (Govern/Detect), NIST SP 800-228 (API security logging), ISO 27001, GDPR (6-12 months),
  PCI-DSS (1 year), SOC 2. Best practices: 1-year min retention, secure storage, integrity, SIEM integration. Big picture:
  Enhances incident response (e.g., SolarWinds), supply chain security.


  Use exact LEARNING OBJECTIVES, SCAFFOLDING LAYERS, ACTIVE LEARNING activities, and FLASHCARD SCHEMA provided. Balance: 2-3
  per Bloom''s level, 3-4 per layer. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards matching the schema. Ensure explanations tie to
  prior knowledge (APIs/logging basics) and real-world (vendor policies, costs vs. compliance).'
