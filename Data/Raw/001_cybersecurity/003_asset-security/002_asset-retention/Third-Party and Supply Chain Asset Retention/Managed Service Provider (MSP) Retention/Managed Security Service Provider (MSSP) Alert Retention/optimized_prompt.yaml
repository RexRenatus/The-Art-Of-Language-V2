active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a scenario where storage costs are rising and a new regulation requires 2-year retention, debate the
    trade-offs of MSSP alert retention periods, considering NIST SP 800-92 guidelines on log management, compliance requirements,
    and threat hunting benefits.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
