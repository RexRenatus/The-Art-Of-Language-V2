active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the risks of inadequate BAA retention (e.g., HIPAA fines up to $1.5M per
    violation) and propose how it links to broader supply chain risk management. Support arguments with HIPAA §164.530(j)
    and real-world breach examples from HHS.gov.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., retention ''1 year'' vs. ''6 years''; ''no retention needed post-term'' vs. ''term + 6 years''; confuse §164.530(j)
    with §164.504; mix NIST with unrelated regs). Ensure distractors test common errors from incomplete compliance knowledge.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Generate
  50 high-quality flashcards on ''Business Associate Agreement (BAA) Retention'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security
  > Asset Retention > Third-Party and Supply Chain Asset Retention > Contract and Legal Document Retention > BAA Retention).
  Cover all Bloom''s levels via these objectives: [insert learning_objectives array]. Incorporate 4-layer scaffolding: [insert
  scaffolding JSON]. Use active learning ties where relevant: [insert active_learning summaries]. Ensure completeness: Best
  practices include retention for term + 6 years (HIPAA §164.530(j), 45 CFR §164.504), secure storage (encrypted, access controls),
  audits, amendments handling. Sources: HHS.gov, NIST SP 800-53. Concept map: Central BAA Retention linked to HIPAA, Third-Party
  Risk, Legal Laws, Asset Security.


  Flashcard distribution: 10 Remember/Understand (Layer 1-2), 15 Apply (Layer 3), 15 Analyze/Evaluate (Layer 2-4), 10 Create
  (Layer 4). Mix formats: 40% definition/TF, 40% MC with distractors, 20% scenario apply/create.
