  discussion_prompt: 'In a critical infrastructure scenario like a power grid under cyber threat (e.g., Stuxnet-like attack),
    debate the optimal change log retention period for SCADA systems: 90 days (cost-effective) vs. 3+ years (forensic depth).
    Support with NIST SP 800-92, NERC CIP-008, and risk considerations.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''No retention needed for OT''), 2) Partial
    truth (e.g., ''30 days per NIST''), 3) Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Infinite retention''). Ensure plausibility
    from voter/research context (e.g., truncated NIST takeaways). Vary difficulty by Bloom''s level.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in SCADA System Change Log
  Retention (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Retention > Mobile/Endpoint > IoT/OT Retention > SCADA
  Change Log Retention). Use the provided learning objectives (spanning Bloom''s Taxonomy), active learning components, 4-layer
  scaffolding (with full content), flashcard schema, and distractor protocol to generate 25 high-quality flashcards.


  **Content Sources (Complete per voter consensus):** NIST SP 800-92 (Log Management: retention 90+ days, lifecycle); NIST
  SP 800-82 (ICS/SCADA security, log importance); NERC CIP-008 R5 (1-year retention for change evidence); NIST CSF (Detect/Respond).
  Best practices: Risk-based (90 days operational, 1-3+ years compliance/critical infra). Key takeaway: Effective retention
  enables incident investigation, compliance, threat detection in OT (e.g., Stuxnet log analysis).


  **Prior Knowledge:** Logging basics, asset security, SCADA fundamentals.


  **Instructions:**

  1. Cover all Bloom''s levels and scaffolding layers proportionally.

  2. For each flashcard, output in exact schema: Front (question), Back (answer, explanation with source/Bloom''s/scaffold
  tie-in/active mini-prompt, distractors if MCQ).

  3. Ensure active learning integration (e.g., questions prompt discussion/problem-solving).

  4. Make explanations educational, tying to real-world OT (power grids), connections (forensics, compliance).

  5. Output as numbered JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}}, ...].
