active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of short-term (90 days) vs. long-term (7 years) retention for certificate-based
    authentication events. Argue using NIST SP 800-63C-4 and SP 800-92 guidelines, compliance requirements (e.g., PCI-DSS
    for payment card auth, GDPR for privacy), storage costs, and detection of anomalies like certificate misuse. Which approach
    best balances security and privacy? Address misconceptions such as certificates being 'infinitely trustworthy' without
    detailed logging.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    revocation logging'' vs. actual CRL/OCSP reqs); 2) Related but incorrect standards (e.g., ''90 days total'' vs. ''90 days
    online + 1 year archival''); 3) Confusions with other auth (e.g., password log fields); 4) Extreme values (e.g., ''7 years
    online'' vs. cost-effective tiers). Ensure distractors are 70-80% plausible to challenge learners.'
