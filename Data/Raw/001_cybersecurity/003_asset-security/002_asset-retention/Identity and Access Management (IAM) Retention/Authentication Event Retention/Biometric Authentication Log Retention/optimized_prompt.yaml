active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a biometric authentication system for a high-security facility, should logs be retained for 1 year
    or 7 years? Debate the trade-offs between compliance (e.g., NIST CSF Respond function), forensic value, storage costs,
    and privacy risks (e.g., biometric data sensitivity under GDPR), citing NIST SP 800-63 guidelines.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Avoid randomness: Ground in research/voter suggestions (e.g., 1yr vs 7yr debate).'
    - 'Coverage: Ensure distractors test analysis (trade-offs) and application (scenarios).'
