      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The core difference between bilateral and multilateral trust agreements in NIST SP 800-63C-4 lies in their establishment: bilateral is direct between two parties, whereas multilateral involves a federation authority to manage relationships among multiple parties, enabling transitive trust.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly link agreement types to specific FAL levels, consent mechanisms, or cryptographic methods, failing to identify the fundamental distinction in how the agreements are established and managed (direct vs. facilitated by a third party).",
        "analogy": "A bilateral trust agreement is like a direct contract between two friends to share a car. A multilateral trust agreement is like joining a car-sharing club with a central administrator who manages memberships and rules for all users."
