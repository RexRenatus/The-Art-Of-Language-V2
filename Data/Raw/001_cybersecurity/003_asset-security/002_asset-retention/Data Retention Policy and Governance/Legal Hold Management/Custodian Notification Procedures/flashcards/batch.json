        "core_logic": "The core difference lies in their purpose and duration: legal holds are specific, temporary preservation orders driven by litigation needs, whereas retention policies are broader, ongoing schedules for data lifecycle management. This functions by ensuring that specific data is preserved when legally required, overriding routine deletion schedules until the legal matter is resolved.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors incorrectly reverse the scope, assign roles, or misrepresent the primary functions of legal holds and retention policies, failing to distinguish between a reactive legal mandate and proactive lifecycle management.",
        "analogy": "A legal hold is like a 'stop' sign placed on a specific road due to an emergency, temporarily halting all traffic. A data retention policy is like the regular speed limit and traffic rules for all roads, dictating normal flow and eventual closure."
