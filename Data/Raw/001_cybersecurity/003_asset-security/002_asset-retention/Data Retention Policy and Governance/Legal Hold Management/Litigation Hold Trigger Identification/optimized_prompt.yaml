active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In groups, debate whether a vague customer complaint email triggers a duty to preserve. Provide arguments
    for and against, citing factors like claim potency, threats received, and case law such as Zubulake v. UBS (e.g., is it
    a 'stronger indicator' like a demand letter?).
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one explains 'duty to preserve' vs. 'litigation hold' using examples (e.g., subpoena = yes trigger;
    office rumor = no) and non-examples, then switch roles and provide feedback.
  problem_solving: 'Analyze three real-world scenarios: (1) Receipt of a cease-and-desist letter, (2) Board discussion of
    a potential lawsuit, (3) Internal email about a regulatory inquiry. For each, identify triggers, recommend actions (e.g.,
    notify legal, suspend deletion), and discuss spoliation risks. Follow with think-pair-share on integration with cybersecurity
    asset retention.'

  - Scaffolding: Use 4 layers progressively [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE].


  Content Knowledge (Web-grounded, voter-consensus complete):

  - Core: Litigation hold suspends routine destruction to preserve relevant ESI upon duty to preserve (triggered by reasonable
  anticipation of litigation). Avoid spoliation sanctions (FRCP 37(e)).

  - Triggers: Formal (summons/complaint, subpoena). Anticipatory (reasonable factors: claim potency, threats/demand letters/cease-and-desist,
  board discussions; vague complaints debatable per Zubulake v. UBS).

  - Process: Good-faith evaluation > notify > hold.

  - Sources: Zubulake v. UBS Warburg, FRCP.
