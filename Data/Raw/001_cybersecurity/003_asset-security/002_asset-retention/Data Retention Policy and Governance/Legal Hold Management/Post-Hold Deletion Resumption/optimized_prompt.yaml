active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the potential consequences of prematurely resuming deletions post-hold
    in a litigation scenario. Consider impacts on data integrity, legal liability, and NIST CSF Recover (RC.RP-1) compliance.
    Support arguments with real-world examples from sources like the Sedona Conference.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 2-3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: (1) Common misconceptions (e.g., confusing resumption
    with hold initiation), (2) Related but incorrect concepts (e.g., standard deletion vs. post-hold), (3) Partial truths
    (e.g., omitting audit trail). Ensure distractors test analysis skills and align with voter consensus on completeness (e.g.,
    NIST Recover details).'
