    2. Related but wrong concept (e.g., confuse with encryption); 3. Partial truth (e.g., ''Annual audits only, ignore post-contract'').
    Base on real-world errors from sources like FDIC cases. Ensure distractors promote critical thinking.'

  **Prior Knowledge Required:** Builds on Data Retention Policy basics, Asset Security fundamentals, third-party risk management.


  **Research Context (Complete Summary):**

  Third-Party Retention Compliance Verification ensures organizations verify third-party providers adhere to data retention
  policies. Core Concepts: Third-party relationships (contracts/outsourcing, FDIC.gov); Data Retention (storage/disposal,
  Drata.com); Compliance Verification (audits/monitoring).

  Standards: NIST SP 800-161 Rev. 1 (Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management, https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/161/r1/final);
  FDIC Interagency Guidance on Third-Party Relationships: Risk Management (full risk assessment, due diligence, contract oversight,
  ongoing monitoring, termination/contingency; https://www.fdic.gov/news/financial-institution-letters/2023/fil23047a.pdf);
  Others: GDPR Art. 28(3)(g) processor obligations, HIPAA Business Associate Agreements.

  Best Practices: 1. Due diligence pre-contract; 2. SLAs with retention clauses/audit rights; 3. Continuous monitoring (reports/certifications);
  4. Independent audits; 5. Post-contract data destruction verification (certs/logs).

  Connection Mapping: Prerequisites (retention lifecycle); Related (Retention Audit); Cross-domain (Legal: GDPR/HIPAA; Business:
  Contracts; Supply Chain: NIST); Real-world: Banking (FDIC), Cloud (vendor audits).
