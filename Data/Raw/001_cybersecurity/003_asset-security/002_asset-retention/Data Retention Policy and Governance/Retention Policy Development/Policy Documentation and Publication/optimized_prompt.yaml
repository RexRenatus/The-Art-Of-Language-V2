  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the trade-offs between making retention policies fully public for transparency versus restricting
    access to prevent adversaries from exploiting them. Reference NIST SP 800-53 PM controls (e.g., PM-9: Risk Management
    Strategy) and consider impacts on asset security in a healthcare scenario handling Federal Contract Information (FCI).'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse policy with procedures; mix
      NIST SP 800-53 with CSF functions; overlook CUI/FCI distinctions).
    - Distractors must be realistic (e.g., partially correct but missing key element) and derived from research context/voter
      suggestions.
    - Avoid obvious wrongs; ensure one distractor is a frequent error (e.g., 'Policies should always be public' vs. access
      controls).
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (20 Basic Q/A, 20 MCQ, 10 Cloze)
  covering ''Policy Documentation and Publication'' in the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Retention
  > Data Retention Policy and Governance > Retention Policy Development > Policy Documentation and Publication.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use elements like discussion debates on policy access, peer teaching on doc vs pub, healthcare FCI scenarios
  in explanations.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute evenly across 4 layers [PASTE FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM ABOVE]; tag each card accordingly.

  - Prerequisites: Link to asset classification/policy fundamentals.

  - Standards: NIST SP 800-53 (PM controls), CSF (Identify/Protect), SP 800-161 Rev. 1 (Supply Chain Risk Management Practices
  for Federal Information Systems and Organizations: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-161r1).

  - Concept Map: Central ''Policy Doc/Pub'' -> Inputs (standards/assets), Processes (draft/review), Outputs (channels), Dependencies
  (governance).


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly [PASTE FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Ensure progressive complexity, voter consensus (100% approval),
  and web-grounded accuracy. Output ONLY a JSON array of 50 flashcards.'
