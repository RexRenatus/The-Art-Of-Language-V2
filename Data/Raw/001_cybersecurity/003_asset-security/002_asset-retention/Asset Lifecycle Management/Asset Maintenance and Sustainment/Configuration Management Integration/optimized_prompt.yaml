  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the trade-offs of strict SecCM baselines versus DevOps agility in preventing breaches like SolarWinds:
    How does rigid CM enhance security, and what risks does it introduce to operational speed? Provide evidence from NIST
    SP 800-128.'
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one partner explains one of the four NIST SP 800-128 SecCM phases (Planning, Identifying/Implementing
    Configurations, Controlling Changes, Monitoring) using a hand-drawn diagram; the partner teaches it back and quizzes on
    key elements like CCB role.
  problem_solving: 'Analyze a scenario where an unauthorized configuration change exposes assets (e.g., unpatched server baseline
    drift): Identify CCB failures, perform inventory and impact analysis, and propose fixes integrating SecCM phases and tools
    like Ansible for baseline enforcement.'

    - Related but incorrect terms (e.g., 'patch management' instead of 'baseline')
    - Out-of-sequence phases (e.g., Monitoring before Planning)
    - Edge cases from real-world (e.g., DevOps agility as distractor for strict CCB)

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Configuration Management
  Integration'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Retention > Asset Lifecycle Management > Asset Maintenance
  and Sustainment > Configuration Management Integration).


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for university-level learning using Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, and
  4-layer scaffolding. Incorporate these exact elements:


  **Learning Objectives:** [Paste the full learning_objectives array here]


  **Active Learning:** [Paste the full active_learning object here] – Tie 10% of cards to these (e.g., scenario from problem-solving).


  **Scaffolding:** [Paste the full scaffolding object here] – Distribute cards: 15 Layer 1, 15 Layer 2, 10 Layer 3, 10 Layer
  4.


  **Research Context:** Use NIST SP 800-128 SecCM phases (Planning/Baseline, ID/Implement, Change Control, Monitoring), SCAP
  tools, baselines, CIs, CCB. Sources: NIST SP 800-128 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-128.pdf),
  SCAP (https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/scap).


  **Output Format (JSON array of objects):** Each flashcard: {"type": "MCQ|Q&A", "front": "Question text", "back": {"answer":
  "...", "explanation": "... (ref Bloom''s, layer, source, example)", "bloom_level": "REMEMBER/etc.", "scaffolding_layer":
  "1-4", "references": ["list"] }, "distractors": ["opt1","opt2","opt3"] (for MCQ only) }.


  **Rules:** Follow flashcard_schema exactly. Distractors must be plausible. Ensure completeness (e.g., SCAP details). Balance:
  60% MCQ. Promote retention via active recall.'
