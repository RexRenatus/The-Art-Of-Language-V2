active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue for or against maintaining EOL assets in production environments. Use NIST SP
    800-40 Rev. 4 principles to support your position, considering cost, risk, compliance, and alternatives like segmentation
    or decommissioning.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ (use for ANALYZE/EVALUATE): 4 options (1 correct, 3 distractors). Distractors: 1) Common misconception
    (e.g., ''Schedule during peak hours for visibility''); 2) Plausible but incomplete (e.g., ''Apply patches without testing'');
    3) Extreme/opposite (e.g., ''Immediately decommission without risk assessment''). Ensure distractors teach by contrasting
    best practices.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 30 high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Maintenance Window
  Planning for EOL Assets'' (Category: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Retention > Asset Lifecycle Management > End-of-Life
  (EOL) Management > Maintenance Window Planning for EOL Assets).


  **Completed Research Context:**

  - **Core Concepts:** EOL Assets: Vendor-unsupported (no patches/support). Maintenance Window: Scheduled maintenance period.
  Asset Inventory: Updated asset list. Vulnerability Management: Identify/assess/remediate vulns (challenging for EOL). Risk
  Management: Control threats.

  - **Standards:** NIST SP 800-40 Rev. 4 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-40r4): Patch/maintenance planning—prioritize,
  schedule off-peak, test/rollback. NIST SP 800-82 Rev. 3 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-82r3): OT security for legacy/EOL
  ICS—recommend isolation, monitoring, migration. NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r5): Controls
  (CM-8 inventory, RA-5 scanning). Best Practices: Off-peak scheduling, enhanced monitoring, segmentation, contingency/rollback,
  decommissioning paths.

  - **Prior Knowledge:** Asset Inventory and Vulnerability Management basics.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives from above].

  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers from above].

  **Active Learning:** [Insert the 3 activities from above]—tie flashcards to these for application.


  **Generation Instructions:**

  - Cover all Bloom''s levels proportionally (5-6 per level), all scaffolding layers, objectives, and research.

  - 40% Q&A/Cloze (REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND), 30% MCQ (ANALYZE), 30% Scenario-based (APPLY/EVALUATE/CREATE).

  - Ensure completeness: Include best practices, NIST details, risks, steps.

  - Use Flashcard Schema exactly: Output as numbered JSON array.

  - Make engaging, measurable, with distractors teaching misconceptions.

  - Tags always include topic hierarchy.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 30 flashcards.'
