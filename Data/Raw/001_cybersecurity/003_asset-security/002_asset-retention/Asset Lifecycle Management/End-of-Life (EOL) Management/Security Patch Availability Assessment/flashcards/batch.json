By ensuring timely updates are available and applied, organizations reduce their attack surface and mitigate risks associated with known vulnerabilities.",

        "analogy": "Assessing patch availability is like checking if there are effective fire extinguishers readily available in a building; the goal is to ensure you can quickly put out a fire (exploit a vulnerability) if one starts."
