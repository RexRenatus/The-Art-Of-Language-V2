active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of using crypto-shredding versus physical destruction
    for deleting sensitive data in a multi-tenant cloud environment. Consider factors like cost, scalability, compliance (e.g.,
    GDPR), and recovery risks. Support arguments with references to NIST SP 800-88.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions: 1) Overly simplistic (e.g.,
    ''Crypto-shredding deletes the data file''), 2) Confuses with alternatives (e.g., ''Same as overwriting data''), 3) Edge
    cases/risks (e.g., ''Works even with weak encryption''). Ensure distractors teach by correction in explanation.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Crypto-Shredding (Cryptographic\

  \ spanning Bloom's Taxonomy (Remember to Create) and 4-layer scaffolding:\n- Layer 1 Foundation: Definitions, prior knowledge\
  \ (encryption basics), concept map.\n- Layer 2 Components: Keys, data at rest, NIST 800-88.\n- Layer 3 Implementation: Steps\
  \ (identify, confirm encryption, delete keys, verify), e.g., AWS S3.\n- Layer 4 Integration: Compliance (GDPR/NIST), best\
  \ practices (robust encryption, no key backups, key rotation, multi-key, verification, audit), risks.\n\nIncorporate active\
  \ learning: Tie cards to discussion (pros/cons vs physical erasure), peer teaching (steps), problem-solving (cloud scenarios).\n\
