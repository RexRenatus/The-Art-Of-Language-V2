active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the feasibility of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) in production environments today. Consider
    computational costs, security guarantees, and real-world alternatives like secure multi-party computation. What industries
    (e.g., healthcare, finance) stand to benefit most, and why? Support arguments with examples from genomic privacy or cloud
    analytics.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

      (claim PHE does multiplication unlimited); Overstate FHE readiness (ignore 10^6x slowdown); Cite irrelevant standards
      (e.g., AES-256 instead of NIST HE).'
    - 'Ensure plausibility: Use real terms but wrong context (e.g., ''bootstrapping decrypts data'' vs. refreshes noise).'

  learning. Topic: Encryption in Use (Homomorphic Encryption). Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Lifecycle
  Management > Data Encryption and Key Management > Encryption Methods > Encryption in Use (Homomorphic Encryption).


  Core Content: Use provided research (HE allows computations on ciphertext; FHE by Gentry 2009; PHE e.g. Paillier; apps:
  cloud, genomics). Integrate scaffolding layers, prior knowledge (basic encryption), big picture (data in use, GDPR), limitations
  (costs, noise), standards (ISO 27001/18, NIST).


  Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE].

  Active Learning: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE] - reference in explanations.


  Generate 40-50 flashcards per EXACT schema:

  - Balance: 10 per Bloom level (tag each).

  - Cover scaffolding layers evenly.

  - 50% MCQ with distractors per protocol.

  - Output JSON array: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''bloom'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''...'',
  ''explanation'': ''...'', ''source'': ''...''}]


  Ensure university pedagogy: Scaffolded, misconception-busting, application-focused. No fluff; precise, measurable.'
