      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "A man-in-the-middle attack during asymmetric key exchange involves an attacker intercepting the communication between two parties. The attacker can then establish separate key exchanges with each party, pretending to be the other. This allows the attacker to decrypt messages from one party, potentially modify them, and re-encrypt them for the other party, effectively eavesdropping and manipulating the entire communication without either legitimate party realizing they are not communicating directly with each other.",
        "distractor_analysis": "MITM attacks focus on impersonation and traffic manipulation, not directly on brute-forcing private keys or forcing symmetric algorithm downgrades as the primary outcome. Direct private key compromise is a different attack vector.",
        "analogy": "A man-in-the-middle attack during key exchange is like two people trying to pass secret notes via a corrupt postal worker. The postal worker intercepts the notes, reads them, potentially changes them, and then passes them on, making each person think they are communicating directly with the other."
