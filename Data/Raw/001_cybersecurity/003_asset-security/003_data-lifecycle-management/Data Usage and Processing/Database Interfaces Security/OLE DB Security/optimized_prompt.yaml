  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (20 Basic Recall, 20 Multiple Choice, 10 Application/Scenario) optimized for Anki/Quizlet,
  covering all voter priorities: complete best practices (least privilege, Windows/SQL Auth, input validation/parameterized
  queries, secure connection strings/no hardcoding, TDS/SSL encryption, provider config/patching, auditing); sources (Microsoft
  OLE DB/SQL Server docs, OWASP Top 10/Injection, NIST SP 800-53/800-45).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Prior Knowledge: Basic DB (SQL/tables), IAM (least privilege), APIs.

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL FROM ABOVE]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL FROM ABOVE]


  Use Flashcard Schema: [INSERT FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Ensure progressive coverage: 30% Layer 1-2, 40% Layer 3, 30% Layer
  4. Balance Bloom''s: 20% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate, 20% Create.


  Core Content:

  - Definitions: OLE DB API, consumers/providers, rowsets, provider-specific.

  - Risks: Injection, auth bypass, data exposure.

  - Best Practices: Full list as voted.

  - Comparisons: vs. ODBC.
