active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Using real-world cases like the 2015 Anthem breach (primarily Security Rule failures in ePHI protection)
    or the 2024 Change Healthcare incident (Privacy and Security violations in data handling), debate whether failures were
    mainly Privacy Rule or Security Rule issues. Propose alternative compliance strategies that balance patient privacy with
    operational efficiency, addressing ethical tensions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors from: (1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''HIPAA only for electronic data''); (2)
    Partial truths (e.g., list only 2/3 safeguards); (3) Related but incorrect concepts (e.g., NIST CSF functions mismatched
    to HIPAA); (4) Real-world edge cases (e.g., non-covered entities). Ensure one distractor is highly plausible to test nuance.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in HIPAA Privacy and Security
  Rules (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Lifecycle Management > Data Governance and Compliance > Regulatory
  Compliance > HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste full list above].

  - Active Learning: Use discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving to inspire scenario-based cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [Paste full scaffolding above]; reference layers in explanations.

  - Prior knowledge: Connect to data classification/privacy basics.

  - Research Context: PHI (identifiable health info any form), ePHI (electronic), Covered Entities (providers/plans/clearinghouses),
  Business Associates (service providers), Privacy Rule (use/disclosure standards), Security Rule (Admin/Phys/Tech safeguards
  for ePHI CIA triad). Align with NIST SP 800-66 (implementation guidance), NIST CSF mappings.


  Follow this exact Flashcard Schema [Paste full schema above] to generate high-quality, optimized flashcards. Output ONLY
  a JSON array of 40-50 flashcards, e.g., [{''question'': ''...'', ''answer'': ''...'', ...}, ...]. Ensure variety, engagement,
  and alignment with Bloom''s Taxonomy for active recall.'
