active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent does the right to data portability balance user empowerment with business interests? Debate
    using examples like Facebook's data download tool versus challenges for small controllers (e.g., technical feasibility
    of direct transmission). Consider ethical trade-offs and potential GDPR fines for non-compliance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors based on voter-identified misconceptions and research: (1) Overly broad scope
    (e.g., ''all personal data including inferred profiles''), (2) Wrong formats (e.g., ''PDF'' vs. machine-readable), (3)
    Incorrect conditions (e.g., ''manual processing'' or ''legitimate interest basis''), (4) Exceptions ignored (e.g., ''always
    direct transmission''). Ensure distractors are 70% plausible from real-world errors per ICO guidance.'

  > Right to Data Portability). Voter consensus: 82.9% approval (7 voters) emphasizes completeness (GDPR Art 20 details: conditions
  like automated processing/consent/contract, provided data only, exceptions like derived data/disproportionate effort), pedagogy
  (Bloom''s progression, active learning), scaffolding, and sources (GDPR eur-lex.europa.eu, ICO ico.org.uk, EDPB).


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Active Learning: [insert summaries above]

  - Scaffolding: 4 layers [insert details above]

  - Prior knowledge: GDPR personal data, controllers, Art 15 access.

  - Big picture: Enables data switching for competition/compliance.

  - Concept map: Central ''Right to Data Portability'' -> definitions, Art 20, related rights, examples.

  - Research: Portability empowers reuse across services; formats CSV/JSON; excludes inferred data.


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (10 per Bloom''s pair: Remember/Understand, Apply/Analyze, Evaluate/Create; 20 mixed
  for scaffolding layers). Cover all objectives, layers, misconceptions. Balance types: 20 basic Q&A, 15 cloze, 15 MCQ.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each matching this schema: {''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''type'': ''basic|cloze|mcq'',
  ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'', ''opt3''] (MCQ only)}. Ensure active recall, spaced repetition
  optimization (concise fronts, detailed backs), university pedagogy (scaffolded complexity).'
