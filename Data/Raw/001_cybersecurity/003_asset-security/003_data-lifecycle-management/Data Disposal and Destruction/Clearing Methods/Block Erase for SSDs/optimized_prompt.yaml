  ### Completed Research Summary

  Block erase erases entire NAND flash blocks on SSDs for sanitization. Key concepts: NAND (pages read/write, blocks erase);
  wear leveling (even write distribution, defeats overwriting); over-provisioning (hidden residual data). Why overwriting
  fails: Moves data via wear leveling, leaves remnants. Methods: ATA Secure Erase (standard command), firmware tools (e.g.,
  hdparm, manufacturer utilities). Standards: NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1 (Purge: Secure Erase for SSDs); Rev. 2 (Guidelines for
  Media Sanitization, emphasizes block erase, crypto erase via encryption keys, destruction); DoD 5220.22-M (clearing standards);
  IEC 62443 (industrial). Sources: NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-88r1.pdf),
  Rev. 2 Draft (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/88/r2/draft); DoD 5220.22-M (https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodd/522022m.pdf).
