        "core_logic": "NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 2 stresses that media sanitization effectiveness is highly dependent on the media type. For example, degaussing is effective for magnetic media but not SSDs, while cryptographic erase is ideal for encrypted SSDs. Overwriting methods that work for HDDs may be inefficient or ineffective for SSDs due to their internal wear-leveling and over-provisioning. Therefore, selecting the correct method based on media type is crucial for ensuring data irrecoverability.",

Using a powerful magnet (degaussing) to clean a glass window (SSD) won't work, just like using a soft cloth (clearing) might not be enough to remove permanent marker from a wall (highly sensitive data on magnetic media). You need the right tool for the right job."
