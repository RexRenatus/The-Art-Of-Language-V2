        "core_logic": "The DoD 5220.22-M standard's effectiveness stems from its multi-pass overwriting process, which ensures that data is overwritten multiple times with specific patterns (zeros, ones, random characters). This systematic overwriting works by disrupting the magnetic or electronic states representing the original data, making recovery extremely difficult and contributing to asset security.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly associate the standard with encryption, degaussing, or file-level deletion, which are different security concepts or methods.",
        "analogy": "It's like painting over a message multiple times with different colors to ensure the original message is completely obscured, rather than just using a single coat of paint."
