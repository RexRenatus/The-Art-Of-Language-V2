active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of degaussing versus physical shredding for destroying
    classified data on LTO-8 tape media in a government agency. Consider cost, environmental impact, compliance with NIST
    SP 800-88 Rev. 2 (Table A-3), and recovery risks. Reference real-world examples from breaches involving tape backups.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions: 1. Overgeneralization (e.g., ''Degaussing
    works for all tapes'' – false for modern LTO with error correction). 2. Confusion with other methods/media (e.g., ''Overwriting
    = Destroy''). 3. Outdated/inaccurate standards (e.g., ''Shred to 6mm particles'' – NIST requires ≤2mm x 2mm for tape).
    Ensure distractors are realistic from voter/research context.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Asset Security > Data Lifecycle
  Management > Data Disposal and Destruction > Media-Specific Destruction > Tape Media Destruction.


  **Context:** Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Lifecycle Management > Data Disposal and Destruction
  > Media-Specific Destruction > Tape Media Destruction. Key source: NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 2 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/88/r2/final).
  Focus: Tape sanitization (Clear: overwrite; Purge: degauss NSA-approved; Destroy: shred ≤2mm x 2mm/incinerate). Prior knowledge:
  General sanitization, data classification.


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list from JSON above].

  - Scaffolding: Generate 20-30 flashcards distributed: 30% Layer 1 (REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND), 30% Layer 2-3 (APPLY/ANALYZE),
  40% Layer 4 (EVALUATE/CREATE).

  - Active Learning Tie-ins: Each flashcard back includes a mini-prompt (e.g., ''Discuss in peer teaching: ...'').

  - Concept Map: Ensure coverage of central node and branches.


  **Output 25 flashcards in JSON array:**

  [{ "front": "Question A) opt1 B) opt2 C) opt3 D) opt4", "back": "Correct: A. Explanation: ... (NIST cite). Bloom: ANALYZE.
  Layer: 3. Activity: Problem-solve scenario Y." }, ...]


  Use Flashcard Schema exactly: MCQ with distractors from protocol. Vary question types (defs, scenarios, comparisons). Ensure
  university-level rigor, no criminal assistance.'
