active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, Student A explains the full periodic classification review process (including triggers, steps,
    and tools) to Student B. Student B then teaches it back using a self-created example of an asset (e.g., a customer database
    post-merger). Switch roles and provide feedback on accuracy.
  problem_solving: 'Simulate a scenario: A dataset classified as ''internal'' pre-merger now contains acquired PII post-merger.
    Review its sensitivity, propose an updated classification (e.g., ''confidential''), justify new controls, and document
    risks if unreviewed. Use NIST SP 800-171r3 criteria for CUI protection.'

  Best practices: University pedagogy (Bloom''s progression, active learning prompts in explanations), voter consensus (completeness
  on NIST/ISO, measurable objectives), web-grounded (cite sources), Anki/SuperMemo optimized (active recall, 1 fact per card,
  images if describable). Ensure factual accuracy; no fabrication.


  Output ONLY as JSON array of flashcards: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
