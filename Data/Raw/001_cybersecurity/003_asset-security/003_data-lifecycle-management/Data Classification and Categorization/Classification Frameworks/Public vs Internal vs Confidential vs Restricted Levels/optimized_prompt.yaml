  Restricted Levels.


  **Topic Hierarchy:** Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Lifecycle Management > Data Classification and Categorization
  > Classification Frameworks > Public vs Internal vs Confidential vs Restricted Levels.


  **Full Topic Content (Completed and Structured):**


  Data classification categorizes data by sensitivity and impact for tailored security. Levels:


  1. **Public:** Intended for public; no harm. Char: Open access. Ex: Press releases, marketing, financial reports. Sec: Integrity
  checks.

  2. **Internal:** Org-only; minor embarrassment. Char: Low sensitivity. Ex: Memos, directories, policies. Sec: Login, VLANs.

  3. **Confidential:** Serious damage (financial/legal/rep). Char: Medium-high. Ex: Customer PII, contracts, legal documents,
  HR records, non-public IP. Sec: Encryption at rest/transit, RBAC, auditing.

  4. **Restricted:** Catastrophic harm. Char: Highest criticality. Ex: Trade secrets, classified data, crypto keys, critical
  infra plans. Sec: Need-to-know, MFA, air-gapping, HSMs.


  **Comparison Table:** [As in scaffolding Layer 2].

  **Sources:** NIST SP 800-53 (Security Controls), ISO 27001 (Annex A.8), CISSP Official Guide (Domain 2).


  **Pedagogical Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list from above].

  - Scaffolding: Generate cards across 4 layers [Insert summaries].

  - Active Learning: Inspire cards from activities (e.g., scenario cards from discussions).


  **Generate 60 flashcards using the schema:**

  - Balance: 10 Remember/Understand (Layer 1-2), 20 Apply/Analyze (Layer 2-3), 20 Evaluate (Layer 3), 10 Create (Layer 4).

  - Types: 25% Basic, 35% MCQ (3 distractors per common errors), 25% Application, 15% Comparison.

  - Distractors: Plausible (e.g., confuse Internal/Confidential examples).

  - Output JSON array: [{''id'':1, ''type'':''MCQ'', ''bloom_level'':''Apply'', ''scaffold_layer'':3, ''front'':''...'', ''back'':''...'',
  ''explanation'':''...'', ''sources'':[''NIST'']}, ...]


  Ensure active recall, spaced repetition friendly, university-level rigor.'
