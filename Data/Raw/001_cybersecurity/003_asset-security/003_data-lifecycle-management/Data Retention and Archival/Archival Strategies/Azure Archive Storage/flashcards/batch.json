        {
          "text": "It is used for active data that needs frequent access and modification.",

        {
          "text": "It is the initial tier for ingesting new data due to its low cost.",
          "misconception": "Targets [ingestion strategy confusion]: Archive is not suitable for initial data ingestion due to retrieval costs and latency."

        }
      ],
      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Data lifecycle management involves moving data through different storage tiers based on access frequency and retention needs. Azure Archive Storage represents the final, most cost-effective tier for data that has reached the end of its active lifecycle but still requires long-term retention, thus aligning perfectly with this principle.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors misrepresent Archive Storage's role in the data lifecycle by suggesting it's for active data, initial ingestion, or temporary staging, all of which contradict its purpose as a long-term, low-cost retention tier.",
        "analogy": "Data lifecycle management is like managing a library: books move from new arrivals (Hot), to general circulation (Cool), to a special collections archive (Archive) when they are rarely read but must be preserved."
