active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Analyze the triggering events for a litigation hold. In groups, debate whether receiving a whistleblower
    complaint always requires an immediate hold or if further assessment is needed, considering risks of spoliation vs. over-preservation

    - 'Base on common misconceptions: e.g., confuse custodian (individual data controller) with data steward (IT/system manager);
      assume all events trigger holds without assessment; overlook metadata/ESI breadth; suggest deleting data during holds.'
    - 'Ensure plausibility: Use similar terms (e.g., ''routine deletion'' vs. ''suspension''); partial truths (e.g., ''only
      emails'' vs. ''all ESI''); edge cases (e.g., ''whistleblower always immediate'' vs. ''assess relevance'').'

    - No more than 60% MCQs; prioritize definitions (30%), scenarios (20%) for active recall.

  **Topic Hierarchy:** Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Lifecycle Management > Data Retention and Archival > Retention
  Policy Development > Litigation Hold Procedures.


  **Completed Research Context:** A litigation hold preserves relevant data to prevent spoliation during anticipated litigation/investigations.
  Key terms: Litigation Hold (internal preservation order); Spoliation (evidence destruction/alteration); ESI (emails, texts,
  social media, docs, databases); Custodian (individual data controller); Data Steward (IT/records manager); Metadata (data
  context like timestamps).


  Triggering Events: Subpoena/court order; lawsuit complaint/service; regulatory investigation notice; whistleblower complaint;
  internal audit/wrongdoing discovery; anticipated disputes (e.g., terminations).


  Step-by-Step Procedures: 1) Legal identifies trigger, assesses scope; 2) Draft/distribute hold notice (matter desc., ESI
  types, no-delete instructions, contacts); 3) ID custodians/stewards; 4) Suspend routine destruction (auto-delete, overwrites);
  5) Custodians acknowledge, search ESI; 6) IT preserves backups; 7) Monitor/remind compliance; 8) Collect ESI securely; 9)
  Document/release post-resolution.


  Best Practices: Employee training; legal hold software (e.g., Catalyst); audit trails; over-preserve to avoid sanctions.
  Risks: Fines, adverse inferences (e.g., Arthur Andersen case). Ties to data lifecycle: Suspends disposition phase.

  **Pedagogy Integration:** Use provided learning_objectives (span Bloom''s: remember/understand/apply/analyze/evaluate/create),
  active_learning activities for context, scaffolding_layers (prior_knowledge + 4 layers) for progression. Prioritize prior
  knowledge links to data retention basics.


  **Flashcard Generation:** Create 50 flashcards following exact flashcard_schema. Cover all objectives/layers evenly. Use
  distractor_protocol for MCQs. Ensure university-level: precise, evidence-based, active recall-focused.


  **Output Format:** JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'':
  ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''type'': ''...''}]. No extra text.'
