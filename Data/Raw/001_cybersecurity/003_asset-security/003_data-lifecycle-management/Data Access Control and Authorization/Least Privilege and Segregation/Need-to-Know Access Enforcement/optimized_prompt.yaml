  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the following: ''How does strict need-to-know enforcement impact productivity
    versus security in a remote work environment? Provide real-world examples from sectors like healthcare or finance, and
    propose mitigations using just-in-time (JIT) access.'' Encourage critical thinking by requiring evidence from sources
    like GSA guidelines.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  focus: ''
  content: 'Define core terms: Need-to-know (access only for specific job duties); Least Privilege (minimum access overall);
    CIA Triad (Confidentiality protects data from unauthorized disclosure). Importance: Minimizes breach risk, enhances accountability,
    prevents insider threats. Example: In healthcare, nurses access only assigned patient charts.'
- level: 2
  name: Layer 2
  focus: ''
  content: 'Relationships: Need-to-know operates within Access Control (post-authentication via Authorization); complements
    Segregation of Duties (no overlapping full access). Links to data lifecycle (classify data first). Tools overview: IAM
    systems enforce via policies.'
- level: 3
  name: Layer 3
  focus: ''
  content: 'Steps: 1. Define roles/jobs; 2. Map permissions to specific needs (avoid broad access); 3. Implement RBAC (role-based)
    or ABAC (attribute-based); 4. Conduct regular audits/reviews and use JIT access. Tools: IAM (e.g., Okta, Azure AD), logging
    for accountability. Example: Annual access reviews revoke unused permissions.'
- level: 4
  name: Layer 4
  focus: ''
  content: 'Connect to Zero Trust (continuous verification); Data Lifecycle Management (access tied to classification); Incident
    Response (audit trails for forensics). Optimization: JIT/PIM (privileged identity management). Real-world: GSA guidelines
    enforce in federal systems to improve accountability and reduce misuse.'

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse need-to-know with full least
    privilege); 2) Related but incorrect concept (e.g., role-based without need-specific mapping); 3) Extreme/overly broad/narrow
    interpretation (e.g., ''no access ever'' or ''access everything''). Ensure distractors are plausible for cybersecurity
    learners, drawn from research context (e.g., over-provisioning risks).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Asset Security and Data
  Lifecycle Management. Topic: Need-to-Know Access Enforcement (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Lifecycle
  Management > Data Access Control and Authorization > Least Privilege and Segregation > Need-to-Know Access Enforcement).
  Voter consensus: 82.9% approval, priorities on Bloom''s Taxonomy, 4-layer scaffolding, active learning, completeness from
  GSA/NIST sources.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives (span all Bloom''s levels as listed).

  - Scaffolding layers (cover all 4 layers progressively; include prior knowledge, analogy, concept map elements).

  - Active learning ties (e.g., reference discussion scenarios in explanations).

  - Research: Definitions from GSA CIO-IT Security-01-07 Rev. 7; importance (minimize breaches, accountability); steps (roles,
  RBAC/ABAC, audits); integrations (zero trust, JIT).


  Generate 40 high-quality flashcards (10 per Bloom''s pair: Remember/Understand, Apply/Analyze, Evaluate/Create; balanced
  across layers). Use schema: JSON array of objects with ''front'', ''back'', ''type'' (mcq/cloze/short_answer), ''bloom_level'',
  ''scaffolding_layer'', ''distractors'' (for mcq), ''explanation'', ''hint''. MCQs: 4 options (1 correct). Distractors per
  protocol. Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, misconceptions addressed. Vary formats
  for engagement. Output ONLY valid JSON array.'
