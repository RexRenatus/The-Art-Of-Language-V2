        "core_logic": "In differentially private histograms, if the system dynamically creates bins based on the data (e.g., only showing bins for months where sales occurred), the very existence or non-existence of a bin can reveal information without noise. For example, if no sales occurred in June, a dynamically generated histogram might simply omit the June bin, implicitly stating 'zero sales' with perfect certainty. By pre-specifying all possible bins (e.g., all 12 months), noise can be added to each count, including zero counts, ensuring the privacy guarantee holds.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractor 1 incorrectly links bin specification to accuracy. Distractor 2 wrongly connects it to epsilon calculation. Distractor 3 reverses the requirement, suggesting it's for non-private histograms.",
        "analogy": "Imagine asking a group to report the number of people wearing red shirts. If you only ask them to report counts for colors *actually seen*, and no one wore blue, you might not get a report for blue at all. With DP, you must ask for counts for *all* possible colors (red, blue, green, etc.), even if the count is zero, to prevent the absence of a color from revealing information."
