active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, explain the roles of data exporters and importers under GDPR Article 44-50. Teach back the differences
    between standard transfer tools (e.g., SCCs, BCRs) and derogations (Article 49), using analogies like 'border control
    checks for data'.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: An EU firm transfers HR personal data to a cloud provider in Brazil (no adequacy decision).
    Step through a TIA: Identify risks (e.g., local laws), select tools (e.g., SCCs + encryption), evaluate supplements, and
    document per EDPB template.'

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema: Front (MCQ question + 4 options), Back (correct answer, detailed
  explanation with GDPR/EDPB/Schrems II references, distractor rationale, Bloom''s level, scaffolding layer, active learning
  link).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste full list above]

  - Active Learning: Embed links (e.g., ''Discusses SCCs effectiveness per discussion prompt'').

  - Scaffolding: Distribute across 4 layers [paste full layers].

  - Prerequisites/Big Picture: GDPR Art 44-50, CIA triad, fines risk.

  - Completeness: Full GDPR Chapter V details, EDPB TIA steps, examples (Schrems II, EU-Brazil scenario).


  Flashcard Schema Rules: [paste full schema]. Ensure distractors from misconceptions (e.g., SCCs suffice without supplements).
  Balance Bloom''s: 40% low (Remember/Understand), 60% high (Apply+). Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'':
  {''correct'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ...}}].


  Prioritize university pedagogy: Active recall, spaced repetition, misconceptions correction.'
