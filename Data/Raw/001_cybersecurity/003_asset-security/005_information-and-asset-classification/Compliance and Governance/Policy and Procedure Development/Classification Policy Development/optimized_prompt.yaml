  discussion_prompt: In groups, discuss the challenges of implementing data classification policies in a large organization
    (e.g., user resistance, legacy data). Propose solutions drawing from NIST IR 8496 and SP 800-53, and debate how classification
    impacts access control and compliance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Common error (e.g., ignore CIA for cost-based); 3) Extreme/opposite (e.g., ''share publicly'' for sensitive data).
    Ensure plausibility from research context.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Asset Security and Compliance
  domains. Topic: Classification Policy Development (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and Asset Classification;
  Entry: Compliance and Governance > Policy and Procedure Development).


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning objectives: [insert full list from ''learning_objectives'']

  - Scaffolding layers: [insert full details from ''scaffolding_layers'']

  - Active learning for context: [insert summaries]

  - Research: NIST IR 8496 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2023/NIST.IR.8496.ipd.pdf), NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5; common
  levels (Public/Internal/Confidential/Restricted); CIA criteria.

  - Prior knowledge: Asset ID and policy basics.

  - Concept map: Central ''Classification Policy'' connected to Data Governance (parent), Data Management/Access Control (outcomes),
  NIST controls/Metadata (related/enablers).
