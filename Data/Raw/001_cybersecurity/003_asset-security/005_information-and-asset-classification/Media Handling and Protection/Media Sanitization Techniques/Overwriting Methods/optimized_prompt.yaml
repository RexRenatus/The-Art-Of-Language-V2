active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate whether single-pass overwriting is sufficient for modern HDDs and SSDs versus legacy multi-pass
    methods like DoD 5220.22-M. Reference NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1, address data remanence misconceptions, and consider factors
    like media type and data classification.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common myths (e.g., ''3-pass DoD required for
    all media''); 2) Confusions between categories (e.g., Clear as physical); 3) Outdated standards (e.g., multi-pass for
    SSDs); 4) Edge cases (e.g., wrong media type). Ensure distractors are realistic but incorrect per NIST SP 800-88.'

  > Media Sanitization Techniques > Overwriting Methods).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE] – Weave in prompts/scenarios.

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL DETAILS FROM ABOVE] – Distribute cards: 8 Layer 1, 8 Layer 2, 8 Layer 3, 6 Layer 4.

  - Ensure 40% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate/Create.

  - Cover key content: NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1 (Clear: single-pattern overwrite; Purge: advanced overwrite/lab-proof; Destroy:
  physical), data remanence, DoD 5220.22-M (historical multi-pass), tools (DBAN), modern best practices (fewer passes), SSD
  vs. HDD differences, prerequisites (data classification).


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: [INSERT FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Output types: 10 Basic Q&A, 10 MCQ (with distractors),
  10 Application Scenario.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 30 flashcards: [{''id'':1, ''front'':''...'', ''back'':''...'', ''type'':''...'', ''bloom_level'':''...'',
  ''layer'':1, ''tags'':[''...''], ''explanation'':''...''}]. Ensure variety, no repetition, measurable verbs, and pedagogical
  alignment. Prioritize accuracy from NIST sources.'
