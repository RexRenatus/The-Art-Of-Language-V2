active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given NIST SP 800-88 Revision 1 guidelines, debate whether physical destruction is always required for
    optical media versus other sanitization levels. Consider factors like cost, environmental impact, data classification,
    and real-world data breach case studies (e.g., improper CD disposal leading to leaks).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., ''Clear'' or ''Purge'' for optical media); 2) Incomplete procedures (e.g., ''scratching surface'' instead of shredding);
    3) Confusing with other media (e.g., degaussing for CDs). Ensure distractors are realistic from voter/research context
    (e.g., assuming rewritability).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Asset Security. Generate
  30 high-quality flashcards (10 MCQ, 10 Cloze, 10 Short Answer) on ''Optical Media (CD/DVD) Handling'' following university
  pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives, active learning integration, 4 scaffolding layers, and voter consensus (accuracy:
  NIST SP 800-88 Revision 1; completeness: include labeling/storage/transport/inventory; engagement: case studies).

  Key Content: Optical media definitions; NIST methods (Clear/Purge inapplicable; Destroy via shred/incinerate); handling
  (label/store/transport/inventory); comparisons; compliance; misconceptions (scratching insufficient). Use big picture: Asset
  Security role, NIST CSF. Ensure accuracy, no Clear/Purge for optical.'
