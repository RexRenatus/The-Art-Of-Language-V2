active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of using tape media for backups in a modern cybersecurity
    context (e.g., cost vs. sequential access delays, sanitization challenges). How does it fit into asset security compared
    to cloud or disk alternatives? Support with NIST SP 800-88 references.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Degaussing works on SSDs'—wrong, only
      magnetic media; 'Overwrite is sufficient for Top Secret'—no, requires purge/destroy).
    - 'Draw from research: Mix tape-specific (sequential access) with general media errors (e.g., confuse with optical media).'
    - 'Ensure 1-2 distractors are ''close but wrong'' (e.g., correct method but wrong standard: ''Use consumer degausser for
      classified'').'
    - 'Vary difficulty: Easier cards (Layer 1) have obvious distractors; advanced (Layer 4) subtler policy/compliance errors.'
    quantity: Generate 20-30 flashcards total, balanced across Bloom's levels (4-5 per level) and scaffolding layers.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Asset Security (Tape Media
  Management). Use the provided topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and Asset Classification > Media
  Handling and Protection > Removable Media Management > Tape Media Management. Incorporate this comprehensive content summary:


  Core Concepts: Tape media (sequential magnetic storage for backups/archiving/DR), data remanence, sanitization (degaussing,
  destruction). NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1: Clear (overwrite), Purge (degauss—NSA-approved for classified, e.g., 5,000 Oe+; disrupts
  magnetic alignment), Destroy (shred/incinerate). Asset lifecycle: Acquisition-Use-Sanitization/Disposal. Compliance: GDPR/HIPAA.
