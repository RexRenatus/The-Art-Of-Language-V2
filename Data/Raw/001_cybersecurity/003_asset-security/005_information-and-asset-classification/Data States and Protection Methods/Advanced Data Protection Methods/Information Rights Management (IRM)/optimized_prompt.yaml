active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios might IRM fail to protect sensitive information, such as when shared outside the organization?
    Debate the trade-offs between usability and security in real-world implementations like Microsoft Azure IRM or Adobe Content
    Server, considering ethical implications and alignment with NIST SP 800-53 controls (e.g., AC-3 Access Enforcement).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema: {front, back: {answer, explanation, distractors (array), source},
  metadata: {bloom_level, scaffolding_layer, difficulty}}.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives spanning Bloom''s: REMEMBER (defs/principles), UNDERSTAND (differences/links), APPLY (permissions/scenarios),
  ANALYZE (failures), EVALUATE (trade-offs), CREATE (policy design).

  - Scaffolding layers progressively: Layer 1 Foundation (defs, prior links: classification/RBAC/encryption), Layer 2 Components
  (permissions/policies/tools), Layer 3 Implementation (steps: assess/classify/define/deploy/integrate/test; NIST AC-3/AC-4/AC-16),
  Layer 4 Integration (zero-trust, misconceptions, big picture).

  - Active learning ties: Reference discussion (IRM failures/trade-offs), peer teaching (components), problem-solving (financial
  report scenario).

  - Research: NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r5), Azure RMS, Seclore. Misconceptions for distractors:
  network-only, replaces encryption, no revocation.


  Best practices: Active recall (questions test retrieval), spaced repetition (concise), scaffolding (build complexity), distractors
  plausible from errors/edges. Distribute: 30% L1 easy REMEMBER, 25% L2 med UNDERSTAND/APPLY, 25% L3 med APPLY/ANALYZE, 20%
  L4 hard EVALUATE/CREATE. Mix: 50% MCQ (4 opts), 30% cloze, 20% SA.


  Output as JSON array of flashcards. Ensure educational depth for university-level cybersecurity (CISSP-aligned).'
