  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages and limitations of RBAC by classification compared to Attribute-Based
    Access Control (ABAC) in a healthcare organization handling patient data at different classification levels (e.g., Public
    vs. Confidential). Consider scalability, compliance with NIST SP 800-53, and enforcement challenges.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
