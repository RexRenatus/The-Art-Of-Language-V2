active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a debate format, argue whether the performance benefits of caching and temporary storage outweigh
    the security risks in high-stakes environments like healthcare. Support your position with specific NIST SP 800-53 controls
    (e.g., SC-4, AC-12) and real-world examples of data leaks from poor temporary storage practices.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    mcq_format: 'Always use 4 options (A-D) for MCQs/APPLY/ANALYZE/EVALUATE cards: 1 correct, 3 plausible distractors based
      on common errors (e.g., confusing volatile with persistent storage; mixing AC-12 session termination with MP-6 sanitization;
      overstating ''temporary = no controls needed''). Distractors should be realistic from research context (e.g., wrong
      control family, incomplete control).'
    generation_rules: Draw from scaffolding layers progressively; ensure distractors test prior knowledge anchors (e.g., data
      classification); avoid obvious wrongs.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Asset Security domain.
  Topic: Temporary Storage Controls (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and Asset Classification > Asset
  Handling Requirements > Storage Requirements > Temporary Storage Controls). Use the provided research context: Core concepts
  (data in use, volatile memory, temporary files, cache, session data); NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 controls (AC-12 Session Termination,
  SC-4 Information in Shared Resources, MP-6 Media Sanitization, SC-28 Secure Cryptographic Key Support); NIST SP 800-171
  Rev. 3 (Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information); best practices (auto-deletion, memory scrubbing, encryption). Sources:
  NIST SP 800-53r5 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r5, 2020); NIST SP 800-171r3 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-171r3,
  2024).


  Incorporate university pedagogy: Align flashcards to these SMART learning objectives [insert full list above]. Structure
  content across 4 scaffolding layers [insert full layers above]. Infuse active learning elements (e.g., scenario prompts
  from discussion/problem-solving).


  Generate flashcards following EXACT schema [insert full schema above]. Ensure progressive difficulty (foundation to integration),
  link to prior knowledge (data classification/states), and high voter consensus (84.3%) on NIST focus. Output ONLY a JSON
  array of 50 flashcards, each as an object with keys: front, back, explanation, bloom_level, type, references. No additional
  text.'
