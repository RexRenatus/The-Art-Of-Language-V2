  distractor_protocol: Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse UEBA with SIEM; overlook
    entities; static vs. dynamic baselines). Ensure distractors are 70% similar to correct answer in wording/structure but
    factually wrong. Reference voter-noted issues like UEBA vs. traditional tools.

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives (Bloom''s Taxonomy): [insert full array from ''learning_objectives'']

  - Active Learning: Use to inspire application-based cards (e.g., scenario prompts from discussion/problem-solving).

  - Scaffolding (Progressive Layers): [insert full descriptions from ''scaffolding'']. Distribute flashcards across layers
  (25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4).

  - Prior Knowledge: Link to data classification, access controls, IDS anomalies.

  - Big Picture: UEBA in zero-trust, NIST CSF Detect/Respond, MITRE ATT&CK, AI/ML.

  - Concept Map: UEBA central → UBA/baselines/anomaly detection/risk scoring → threats (insider, APTs, exfiltration).

  - Sources: NIST SP 800-53, NIST CSF, MITRE ATT&CK, Gartner UEBA reports.

  - Voter Consensus: 67.1% approval; emphasize completeness, real-world cases, misconceptions (UEBA ≠ SIEM).


  Generate 40 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet (spaced repetition, active recall). Cover all objectives
  and layers.


  Use exact Flashcard Schema: [insert full schema from ''flashcard_schema''].


  Output ONLY a JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}}, ...]. Ensure variety: 50% definition/remember, 30% apply/analyze
  scenarios, 20% evaluate/create. Make questions challenging yet scaffolded.'
