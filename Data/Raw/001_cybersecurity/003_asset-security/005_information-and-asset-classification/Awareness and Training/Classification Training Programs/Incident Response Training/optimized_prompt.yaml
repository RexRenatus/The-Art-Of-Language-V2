active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the shift in NIST SP 800-61r3 from traditional incident handling to integration with CSF 2.0.
    What challenges might organizations face in implementing this broader risk management approach (e.g., resource allocation,
    skill gaps), and how can targeted training programs address them? Support arguments with evidence from NIST sources.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse traditional NIST phases with
      CSF 2.0; mix up 'Containment' with 'Eradication'; outdated definitions pre-r3).
    - Distractors must be realistic (e.g., from older NIST revisions or partial truths).
    - Ensure one distractor is a 'close but wrong' variant (e.g., wrong phase order).
    - Avoid obvious errors; promote active recall/discrimination.
    examples:
    - 'Q: Primary phases in NIST CSF 2.0 IR? A: Govern-Identify-Protect-Detect-Respond-Recover. Distractors: Preparation-Detection-Containment
      (traditional); Detect-Respond-Recover only.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Incident Response Training
  (corrected hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Operations > Incident Management > Awareness and Training > Incident Response
  Training Programs > Incident Response Training). Use the provided learning objectives (Bloom''s Taxonomy: REMEMBER to CREATE),
  active learning activities, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema to create 50 high-quality, spaced-repetition optimized
  flashcards.


  Incorporate:

  - NIST SP 800-61r3 and CSF 2.0 as core sources (e.g., phases: Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover).

  - Ties to asset classification (e.g., prioritizing confidential assets in IR).

  - Voter priorities: Pedagogy, accuracy, completeness.


  Follow flashcard schema exactly:

  - 60% MCQ with 3 distractors (plausible errors per protocol).

  - Front/Back structure with explanation, Bloom''s level, scaffolding layer.

  - Promote active learning (e.g., scenario Qs from problem-solving exercise).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...''}}]. Ensure variety, no duplicates, university-level rigor.'
