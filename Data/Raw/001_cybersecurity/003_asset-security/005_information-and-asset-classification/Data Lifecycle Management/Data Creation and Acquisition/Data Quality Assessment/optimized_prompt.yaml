active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate which of the six data quality dimensions is most critical for cybersecurity
    asset security. Use real-world examples, such as duplicate alerts causing fatigue in SIEM systems due to poor uniqueness,
    to support your arguments and explore trade-offs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors from: 1. Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Completeness means high data volume''
    vs. required fields); 2. Confused dimensions (accuracy vs. validity); 3. Partial truths (e.g., timeliness as ''speed of
    collection'' vs. up-to-date); 4. NIST misapplications (e.g., wrong control family); 5. Real-world inversions (success
    as failure). Ensure plausible for intermediate learners.'

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list from above]

  - Active Learning: Use examples from discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving for realism.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers (tag each with Layer 1-4).

  - 6 Dimensions: Accuracy, Completeness, Consistency, Timeliness, Validity, Uniqueness.

  - NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5: Focus CM family (CM-1 Policy & Procedures, CM-2 Baseline Configuration, CM-3 Configuration Change
  Control, CM-6 Configuration Settings, CM-8 System Component Inventory, CM-9 Configuration Management Plan); RA-3 Risk Assessment.

  - Real-world: SIEM duplicate alerts (uniqueness failure).

  - Misconceptions: Accuracy≠Validity; Completeness≠Volume.

  - Sources: NIST SP 800-53r5 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r5), DAMA-DMBOK2.


  Generate 40 flashcards (10 per Bloom''s pair: Remember/Understand, Apply/Analyze, Evaluate/Create; balanced across layers).
  Follow exact schema: {''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''correct'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [{''text'': ''...'', ''why_wrong'':
  ''...''} x3], ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''1-4''}}.

  Output as JSON array of flashcards.'
