      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Network protection capabilities like zero trust and moving target defense are designed to prevent lateral movement by segmenting the network and dynamically altering communication paths, because this limits an attacker's ability to spread from one compromised system to others.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors misrepresent the goals of network protection by suggesting a complete external block (too restrictive), focusing solely on encryption (a data-level control), or conflating it with vulnerability patching (a system-level control).",
        "analogy": "Network protection is like having a maze with constantly shifting walls and checkpoints. Even if an intruder gets past the first checkpoint, the maze makes it incredibly difficult for them to reach other areas of the building."
