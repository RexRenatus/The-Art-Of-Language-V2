  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the following: ''In what real-world scenarios (e.g., military operations
    or intelligence sharing) would disclosing Secret-classified information cause "serious damage" to national security, but
    not rise to "exceptionally grave damage"? Provide examples and counterarguments, referencing Executive Order 13526 criteria.''
    Encourage critical thinking by requiring participants to cite prior knowledge of basic classifications (public, internal,
    confidential).'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors from common errors: 1) Understate/overstate damage (e.g., ''minor damage'' for
    Secret), 2) Confuse levels (Secret vs. Confidential/Top Secret), 3) Misattribute authority (OCA vs. derivative classifier),
    4) Ignore standards (wrong EO reference). Ensure plausibility for active recall testing.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for the topic ''Secret
  Classification'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and Asset Classification > Information and
  Data Classification > Classification Schemes and Levels > Secret Classification). Use this completed Research Context:


  **Secret Classification:** Level where unauthorized disclosure could cause **serious damage** to national security (EO 13526).
  **Classified Information:** Protected per national security directives. **National Security:** US defense/foreign relations.
  **Damage:** Serious for Secret. **OCA:** Authorized to originally classify. **Derivative Classification:** Incorporating/marking
  from classified sources (not mere reproduction). **Need-to-Know:** Required access for duties. **Unauthorized Disclosure:**
  Transfer to unauthorized parties.


  **Standards:** Executive Order 13526 (Dec 29, 2009): Defines Confidential (damage), Secret (serious), Top Secret (grave);
  mandates OCAs, 25-year rule. DoDM 5200.01: Marking (e.g., SECRET//NOFORN), handling. **Sources:** EO 13526 (archives.gov/isoo),
  DoDM 5200.01 (esd.whs.mil), NISPOM, ISC standards.


  Prior Knowledge: Builds on basic IT classifications (public/internal/confidential).
