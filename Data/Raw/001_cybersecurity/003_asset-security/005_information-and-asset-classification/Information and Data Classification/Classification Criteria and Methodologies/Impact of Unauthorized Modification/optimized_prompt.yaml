active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a healthcare organization, an employee makes an unauthorized change to patient data classification
    settings to speed up access. Discuss the potential impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad),
    and debate whether this should be treated as a malicious insider threat or negligence, considering ethical, risk, and
    classification implications.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    vs. Detect), 3) Overgeneralization (e.g., wrong function family). Ensure plausible for learners at prior Bloom''s level.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Asset Security and Information
  Classification. Topic: ''Impact of Unauthorized Modification'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information
  and Asset Classification > Information and Data Classification > Classification Criteria and Methodologies > Impact of Unauthorized
  Modification). Consensus: 100% voter approval on completeness (full NIST CSF ID/PR/DE/RS/RC), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression),
  scaffolding (4 layers), and activities.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: Use elements in scenario-based cards (e.g., healthcare discussion, SolarWinds peer teach, cloud problem-solving).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [PASTE scaffolding here]; prerequisites: CIA triad basics.

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following this EXACT schema:

  [{''id'': int, ''layer'': str (1-4), ''bloom_level'': str, ''nist_reference'': str (e.g., ''DE.CM''), ''source'': str, ''front'':
  {''question'': str, ''options'': [''A) ...'', ''B) ...'', etc.], ''hint'': str (optional)}, ''back'': {''correct_answer'':

  Ensure: University pedagogy (active recall, spaced repetition); Distractors per protocol; Balance Bloom''s/layers; Real-world
  ties (e.g., SolarWinds, healthcare); No criminal assistance. Output ONLY the JSON array.'
