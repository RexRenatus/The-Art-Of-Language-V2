  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''A CMDB is essential for cybersecurity but often fails
    due to poor data accuracy.'' Provide evidence from NIST SP 800-128 or ITIL, and propose solutions. (Encourages critical
    thinking and evidence-based arguments.)'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Asset Security and CMDB.\
  \ Use the provided topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and Asset Classification > Technology and\
  \ Automation > Asset Management Systems > Configuration Management Database (CMDB). Incorporate completed research context:\
  \ CMDB is a centralized repository for IT assets/configurations/relationships; key concepts: CI, baseline, CM, SecCM. NIST\
  \ SP 800-128: Comprehensive guide for SecCM (planning, implementing, controlling, monitoring configs for security; https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-128.pdf).\
  \ ITIL: CMDB central to ITSM config mgmt. Voters prioritized completeness, Bloom's pedagogy, 4-layer scaffolding, concept\
  \ map, active learning, cross-links (DevOps/compliance).\n\nGenerate 60 high-quality flashcards following this EXACT schema\
  \ per card:\n{\n  'layer': 1-4 (from scaffolding),\n  'bloom_level': 'REMEMBER|UNDERSTAND|APPLY|ANALYZE|EVALUATE|CREATE',\n\
  \  'front': 'Question text',\n  'type': 'Cloze|MCQ|Short Answer',\n  'back': {\n    'answer': 'Direct answer',\n    'explanation':\
