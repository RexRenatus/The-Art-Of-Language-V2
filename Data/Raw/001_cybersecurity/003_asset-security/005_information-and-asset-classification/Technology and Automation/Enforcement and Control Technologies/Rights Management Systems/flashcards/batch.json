      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "RMS offers superior control because it governs post-access actions like printing or copying, functioning by embedding granular usage policies directly with the asset. This is a significant advantage over encryption, which primarily ensures confidentiality and doesn't dictate specific user actions after decryption.",
