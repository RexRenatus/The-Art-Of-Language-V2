active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a scenario where a company faces frequent ransomware attacks, debate whether a hybrid backup architecture
    provides superior protection compared to cloud-only or on-premises-only approaches. Consider factors like RTO, RPO, cost,
    compliance with NIST CSF, and potential misconceptions that hybrid is always best. Support your position with real-world
    examples and sources.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    for RPO); 2) Partial truths (e.g., ''Cloud-only is always cheaper''); 3) Confused terms (e.g., mix RTO/RPO); 4) Edge cases
    (e.g., non-applicable standards). Ensure plausible for testing analysis.'

  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Active Learning: Use concepts from discussion (ransomware trade-offs), peer teaching (standards quiz), problem-solving
  (financial firm design) to inspire scenario flashcards.

  - Scaffolding Layers: [insert full descriptions above]. Distribute flashcards evenly (10 per layer).

  - Prior knowledge: Link to basic backups (full/incremental, 3-2-1 rule).

  - Research: NIST CSF (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework: Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover), MCSB (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/backup-recovery:
  BR-1 strategy, BR-2 immutability, BR-3 testing), ZTA principles.


  Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards following this exact schema:

  Output ONLY a JSON array of objects, e.g., [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': 1, ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'']}}, ...]. Ensure university-level pedagogy:
  active recall, spaced repetition, misconception-busting distractors.'
