      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Cloud environments abstract the underlying infrastructure. While cloud providers offer logging services (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, Azure Monitor), gaining the deep, granular visibility into database activity that on-premises DAM tools provide can be challenging due to provider controls and shared responsibility models.",

You can see what happens inside the office through provided security feeds (cloud logs), but you can't directly access the building's main electrical panel or network infrastructure."
