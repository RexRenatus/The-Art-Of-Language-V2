active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using a traditional DMZ versus a Science DMZ for high-volume
    scientific data transfers. Consider factors like performance, security risks, and compliance with NIST standards. Support
    your arguments with real-world examples from sources like ESnet's Science DMZ deployments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Distractor 1: Semantic confusion (e.g., confuse DMZ with VLAN).

    - Distractor 2: Overgeneralization (e.g., ''DMZ eliminates all firewalls'').

    - Distractor 3: Edge case reversal (e.g., swap inner/outer firewall roles).

    Ensure distractors are realistic from research (e.g., outdated practices) and educate via explanations.'

  **Research Context**: DMZ is a buffer subnetwork between internal LAN and external networks (TechTarget). Key: Perimeter
  network, DTN (high-perf transfer), Science DMZ (EPOC.global). Best Practices (NIST SP 800-41/53): Firewall configs (dual
  firewalls, stateful), least privilege, minimal services, monitoring/SIEM, audits, secure protocols (SFTP/HTTPS), segmentation.
  Examples: ESnet Science DMZ. Sources: [TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/DMZ), [EPOC.global
  Science DMZ PDF](https://epoc.global/media/filer_public/af/c2/afc22619-f669-4570-a566-a4c22562e0de/science-dmz-secure-high-performance-data-transfer.pdf),
  NIST SP 800-41/53.
