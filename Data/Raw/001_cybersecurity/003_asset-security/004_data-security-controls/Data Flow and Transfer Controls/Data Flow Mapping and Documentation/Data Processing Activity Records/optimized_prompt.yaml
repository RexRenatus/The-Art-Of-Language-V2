  Incorporate this full research context:

  - Personal Data/Processing definitions from uillinois.edu.

  - RoPA: Comprehensive records of processing activities per GDPR Art. 30 (controllers: >250 employees or risks; all processors).
  Elements: purposes, categories, recipients, transfers, retention, security (privacyengine.io, ico.org.uk).

  - NIST: SP 800-53 Rev5 (RA-3, PM-9 for risk mgmt/assets); NISTIR 8053 (data flows). Sources: gdpr.eu/art-30, ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/accountability-and-governance/accountability-framework/records-of-processing-activities-ropa.

  - Case: British Airways €20M fine (poor processing docs).


  Use provided learning_objectives (span Bloom''s: 1 Remember, 1 Understand, 1 Apply, 1 Analyze, 1 Evaluate, 1 Create), active_learning_components
  for scenario inspiration, scaffolding_layers (balance flashcards: 6-8 per layer), and flashcard_generation_schema EXACTLY.


  Generate 25-30 flashcards covering all objectives/layers, including prior knowledge links, concept map elements, template
  usage, real-world cases. Vary types: definitions, scenarios, critiques.


  Output ONLY a valid JSON array in snake_case: [{''question'': ''...'', ''correct_answer'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''d1'',''d2'',''d3''],
  ''explanation'': ''...''}, ...]. No extra text.'
