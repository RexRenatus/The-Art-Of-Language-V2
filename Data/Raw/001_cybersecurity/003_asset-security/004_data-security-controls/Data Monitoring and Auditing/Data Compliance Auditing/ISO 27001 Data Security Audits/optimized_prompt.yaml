  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors that are plausible but incorrect: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confusing
    Annex A count/themes), 2) Related but off-topic concept (e.g., NIST instead of ISO), 3) Partial truth (e.g., outdated
    2013 version numbers). Ensure distractors promote critical thinking by requiring analysis of nuances like 2022 vs. prior
    editions.'
