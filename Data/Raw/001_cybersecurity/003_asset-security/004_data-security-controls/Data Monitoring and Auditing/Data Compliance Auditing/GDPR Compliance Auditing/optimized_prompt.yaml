  **Topic Context:**

  - Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Security Controls > Data Monitoring and Auditing > Data Compliance Auditing
  > GDPR Compliance Auditing.

  - Research Summary: GDPR (EU Reg 2016/679) mandates auditing for personal data protection. Core: Accountability (Art. 5(2),
  demonstrate compliance via RoPAs Art.30, DPIAs Art.35). ICO (UK regulator) provides Data Protection Audit Framework (systematic
  assessment) and Guide to Accountability/Governance (leadership, evidence). 9 ICO Toolkits: accountability, DPO, contracts,
  data sharing, security (Art.32), international transfers, rights, breach mgmt, training. Case studies: British Airways £20m
  fine (2018 breach). Compare NIST Privacy Framework. Sources: ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-accountability-and-governance,
