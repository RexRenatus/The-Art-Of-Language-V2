        "core_logic": "Forensic readiness ensures that audit logs are collected, protected, and retained in a manner that supports future investigations. This proactive approach is crucial because it guarantees that when an incident occurs, the necessary evidence is available and trustworthy, thus upholding the chain of custody.",
