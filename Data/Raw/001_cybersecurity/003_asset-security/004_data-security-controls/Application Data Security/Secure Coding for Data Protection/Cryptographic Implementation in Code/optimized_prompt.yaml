active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using symmetric vs. asymmetric encryption in a real-world
    web application for protecting user data at rest. Consider performance, key management complexity, and vulnerability to
    side-channel attacks. Provide evidence from standards like NIST SP 800-57.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''AES uses public/private
    keys'' for symmetric Q), 2) Partial truths (e.g., outdated practices like DES), 3) Related but incorrect concepts (e.g.,
    hashing vs. encryption), 4) Voter priorities (key mgmt flaws, insecure code patterns). Ensure distractors are realistic
    from OWASP/NIST pitfalls. Balance across layers/objectives.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Cryptographic Implementation
  in Code'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Security Controls > Application Data Security > Secure
  Coding for Data Protection > Cryptographic Implementation in Code). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning
  activities, 4 scaffolding layers, and flashcard schema to generate 50 high-quality MCQ flashcards (12-13 per layer, spanning
  all Bloom''s levels).


  Incorporate:

  - Voter consensus: Complete key management (full lifecycle incl. destruction), Python code examples (cryptography lib for
  AES/RSA), secure vs. pitfalls.

  - Research context: Definitions (crypto, algos, keys, AES symmetric, RSA asymmetric), standards (AES-256, NIST).

  - Pedagogy: University-style (active recall, spaced repetition), scaffolded progression.


  Generate flashcards progressively: Layer 1 (foundation definitions), Layer 2 (components/frameworks), Layer 3 (code impl.),
  Layer 4 (integration/pitfalls).

  Ensure variety: 20% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 30% APPLY/ANALYZE, 30% EVALUATE, 20% CREATE. Include code-related Qs (e.g., ''Fix
  this snippet'').


  Output strictly as JSON array of 50 objects matching the flashcard schema. No extra text.'
