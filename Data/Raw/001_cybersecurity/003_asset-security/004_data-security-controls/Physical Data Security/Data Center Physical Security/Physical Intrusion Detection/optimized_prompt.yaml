active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the pros and cons of different PIDS sensor types (e.g., PIR motion detectors vs. microphonic cable
    sensors) for securing a high-value data center perimeter. Consider factors like cost, false positive rates, environmental
    resilience, and integration with cybersecurity measures. Use real-world examples, such as physical aspects of the 2019
    Equifax breach, to support arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    3 distractors per MCQ.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Physical Intrusion Detection
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Security Controls > Physical Data Security > Data Center Physical
  Security > Physical Intrusion Detection). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities, 4-layer scaffolding,
  and flashcard schema to generate 50 high-quality flashcards.


  Incorporate: University pedagogy (Bloom''s progression), voter consensus (clarity, completeness with full sensor list incl.
  microphonic cables, real-world cases like Equifax), web research (PIDS defs from deepsentinel.com, sensors: PIR/microwave
  motion, vibration, etc.; cyber-physical security from accenture.com).


  Prioritize: Scaffolding coverage (12-13 cards/layer), objectives span, active learning ties (e.g., scenario cards for problem-solving).
  Fix sources: deepsentinel.com.


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"front": "...", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "bloom_level":
  "...", "scaffolding_layer": "...", "distractors": ["...", "...", "..."]}} (omit distractors if non-MCQ). Ensure engaging,
  precise, educational content for data center focus.'
