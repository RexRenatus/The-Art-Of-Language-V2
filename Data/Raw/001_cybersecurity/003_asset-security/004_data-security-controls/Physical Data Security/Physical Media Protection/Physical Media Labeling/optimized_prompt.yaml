active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a cloud-centric era, debate the ongoing relevance of physical media labeling. Analyze real-world breaches
    (e.g., lost labeled USBs causing data leaks like the 2010 Wikileaks incident) versus cloud alternatives, categorizing
    risks (physical loss vs. misconfiguration) and proposing hybrid solutions. Address misconceptions like 'physical media
    is obsolete.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    guidelines: 'Generate plausible distractors based on common misconceptions: 1) Labeling only for digital media (ignore
      paper/output); 2) Confuse with encryption/sanitization; 3) Overlook non-removable media; 4) Misstate standards (e.g.,
      ''MP-03 is for cloud only''); 5) Partial truths (e.g., markings without caveats). Ensure 70% of cards are MCQs.'
    count: 3 distractors per MCQ, labeled A/B/C/D with correct indicated.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Asset Security (Physical
  Media Labeling). Use the provided topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Security Controls > Physical Data
  Security > Physical Media Protection > Physical Media Labeling.


  Incorporate this optimized content:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM JSON]

  - Active Learning: Use elements for scenario-based cards (e.g., discussion debates as prompts).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers (Layer 1: 30%, Layer 2: 25%, Layer 3: 25%, Layer 4: 20%).

  - Research Context: Physical media labeling per NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 MP-03 (Media Marking): Organizations shall (a) establish
  and document media labeling requirements; (b) affix external labels to removable media and output indicating sensitivity,
  distribution limits, handling caveats. NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1: Guidelines for Media Sanitization (links labeling to disposal).
  FIPS 199: Categorization (Low/Mod/High). Examples: HDDs, USBs, paper. Sources: https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final,
