active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains how Gaussian or Laplace noise addition works in differential privacy; the
    partner teaches back with a simple dataset example (e.g., adding noise to ages in a patient record).
  problem_solving: Design a noise addition strategy for a mock customer dataset (e.g., add Laplace noise to salaries with
    a calibrated epsilon); test utility by recomputing averages and discuss privacy guarantees against re-identification attacks.

  **Research Context (Web-Grounded, Completed):** Noise addition is a perturbation technique in data masking/anonymization,
  adding random noise (e.g., Gaussian N(0,σ²) or Laplace Lap(0,b)) to numerical data to prevent re-identification while preserving
  utility for analysis. NIST SP 1800-28B (''Mobile Device Security: Corporate-Owned Personally-Enabled (COPE)'') and NISTIR
  8062 discuss anonymization via noise in shared datasets; NIST CSF 2.0 (Protect: PR.DS-5 data-in-transit security, ID.AM-1
  asset inventory) supports via obfuscation. Examples: Add Laplace noise to salaries (b = sensitivity/ε) for differential
  privacy (DP: ε-DP bounds re-identification). Goals: Obfuscation (hide patterns), deterrence (increase attacker effort),
  utility balance. Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), NIST SP 1800-28B (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1800-28B.pdf),
  NIST Privacy Framework (https://www.nist.gov/privacy-framework), OWASP Data Anonymization (https://owasp.org/www-project-cheat-sheets/cheatsheets/Data_Anonymization_Cheat_Sheet.html).


  **Incorporate Exactly:**

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the learning_objectives array here verbatim]. Cover all evenly (4-5 cards per level).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards: Layer 1 (6 cards), Layer 2 (6), Layer 3 (7), Layer 4 (6).

  - Active Learning: Tie 20% of explanations to discussion/peer/problem-solving (e.g., ''Practice in peer teaching'').


  **Output 25 Flashcards Strictly in JSON Array:** Use exact flashcard_schema structure. Vary types: 40% definition/cloze,
  30% explanation/short answer, 20% MCQ (with distractors), 10% scenario/application. Ensure accuracy to data masking focus
  (not general obfuscation). No duplicates; progressive difficulty mirroring Bloom''s/scaffolding.'
