active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether the 'Right to be Forgotten' (Right to Erasure) should have exceptions
    for public interest (e.g., criminal records or news articles). Support arguments with specific GDPR articles (e.g., Article
    17), real-world examples (e.g., Google delisting cases), and ethical considerations in cybersecurity contexts like threat
    intelligence sharing.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ cards (50% of total): Generate 4 options (1 correct, 3 distractors based on voter-noted misconceptions/common
    errors, e.g., ''Erasure deletes all data immediately'' as distractor for Right to Erasure; confusing controller/processor
    roles; mixing restriction with portability; ignoring timelines/exceptions). Distractors must be plausible (e.g., from
    real GDPR misinterpretations) and explained on back (why wrong).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Data Subject Rights Management
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Security Controls > Privacy and PII Protection > Privacy Regulation
  Compliance > Data Subject Rights Management). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities, 4-layer
  scaffolding, and flashcard schema to generate high-quality, pedagogically optimized flashcards.


  CONTENT COVERAGE: Ensure completeness of 8 GDPR Data Subject Rights (Informed, Access, Rectification, Erasure/''Forgotten'',
  Restriction, Portability, Object, Automated Decision-Making/Profiling). Include definitions (Layer 1), components/relationships
  (Layer 2), DSAR handling steps/timelines (Layer 3), integrations (DLP, IAM, automation; Layer 4), prior knowledge (PII,
  data classification), examples, misconceptions.


  PEDAGOGY: Align cards to Bloom''s objectives. Incorporate active learning (e.g., scenario cards for problem-solving). Use
  scaffolding progression in card tags/sequences.


  OUTPUT FORMAT: JSON array of 75 flashcards. Each: {''front'': ''Question/Prompt (text or cloze)'', ''back'': ''Answer |
  Explanation (with ref, example, layer, misconception) | Blooms: Level | Tags: [right_name, layer_X, activity_type]''}.


  Generate now: 30% MCQs with distractors (plausible misconceptions), 40% Q&A definitions/scenarios, 30% higher-order (analyze/evaluate/create
  prompts). Vary difficulty; ensure web-grounded accuracy (GDPR Articles 12-23).'
