active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In light of the 2024 NPRM proposals to the HIPAA Security Rule, debate whether requiring annual technology
    asset inventories and network maps for ePHI is feasible for small healthcare practices versus large hospitals. Consider
    costs, resources, ethics, scalability, and propose practical compromises to balance security and accessibility.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: Distractors must be plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse 'covered entities' with
    'business associates'; mix HIPAA Privacy vs. Security Rule; outdated pre-NPRM requirements). Ensure 1-2 distractors are
    'near-misses' (e.g., correct term but wrong context), 1 overly broad/general, 1 unrelated but HIPAA-adjacent.

  Use this research context: [Insert full research context here, including core concepts (ePHI, covered entities, etc.), HIPAA
  Security Rule safeguards, 2024 NPRM proposals for annual asset inventories/network maps/anti-malware/port controls (https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/nprm-fact-sheet/index.html),
  and sources]. Best practices: Use tools like CMDB for inventories, diagramming software for maps; common challenges: Incomplete
  assets, dynamic networks.
