active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a healthcare organization, should doctors have access to all patient records in the hospital database,
    or only those relevant to their current patients? Debate the implications for patient privacy (confidentiality via need-to-know),
    emergency response (least privilege exceptions), and workflow efficiency, referencing NIST SP 800-53 AC-6 and common misconceptions
    about universal 'role-based' access.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''need-to-know allows role-based universal
    access''), 2) Related but incorrect concept (e.g., mix-up with least privilege extremes), 3) Edge case reversal (e.g.,
    over-restricting emergencies). Ensure plausibility from voter-noted pitfalls like universal access myths.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Need-to-Know Access Enforcement''
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Data Security Controls > Access Control for Data > Data Access Control
  Lists > Need-to-Know Access Enforcement).


  Generate 20 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet using university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (use provided
  objectives), active learning (discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving tie-ins), 4-layer scaffolding (reference layers in
  explanations), and voter consensus (e.g., ABAC/RBAC comparisons, healthcare/gov scenarios).


  Incorporate this research context: Need-to-know restricts access to job necessities (granular least privilege). Key: Subjects/objects/attributes;
  models RBAC/ABAC (NIST 800-162); NIST SP 800-53 AC-6: Least privilege/need-to-know via ACLs, reviews; CIA confidentiality;
  sources NIST 800-53/162, CIS Controls, ISO 27001.
