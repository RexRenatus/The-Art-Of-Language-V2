        "core_logic": "A 'Joiner, Mover, Leaver' (JML) process is essential because it systematically manages access rights throughout a user's lifecycle, ensuring timely provisioning, modification, and deprovisioning. This structured approach functions by linking HR events to automated or semi-automated access control workflows.",
