active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios would you choose incineration over pulverization for data sanitization, and vice versa?
    Consider factors like media type (e.g., SSDs vs. paper), data sensitivity (e.g., CUI), cost, environmental impact, site
    capabilities, and NIST 800-88 guidelines. Debate with evidence from real-world data breaches caused by improper disposal
    (e.g., lost hard drives in breaches like the 2017 Equifax incident).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    is always cheaper than pulverization'' – wrong due to equipment costs; ''Pulverization works equally on SSDs and HDDs
