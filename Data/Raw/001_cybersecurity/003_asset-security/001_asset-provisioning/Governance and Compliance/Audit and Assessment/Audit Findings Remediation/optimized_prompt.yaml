active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given limited resources, debate how to prioritize audit findings remediation in asset security (e.g.,
    risk-based vs. compliance-driven approaches). Use real-world examples from NIST SP 800-53, GAO CPAG reports, or FISMA
    compliance to support arguments, considering impacts on organizational cybersecurity maturity.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g., confuse POA&M with
    risk register), 2) Partial truths (e.g., wrong framework like ISO 27001 instead of NIST), 3) Edge cases (e.g., reverse
    prioritization logic), 4) Web/research-grounded errors (e.g., outdated GAO guidance). Ensure distractors are realistic
    to challenge understanding without being tricky.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom''s Taxonomy, active
  learning, and scaffolding. Generate high-quality, optimized flashcards for the topic ''Audit Findings Remediation'' (Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Provisioning; Governance and Compliance > Audit and Assessment > Audit Findings Remediation).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ''learning_objectives'']

  - Active Learning: Use elements like discussion on prioritization, peer teaching on POA&Ms, problem-solving scenarios in
  explanations/tags.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute content across 4 layers: [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING ARRAY].


  Follow this exact output schema for 30 flashcards: JSON array of objects matching [FLASHCARD_SCHEMA details]. Ensure variety:
  12 MCQ (with distractors), 9 basic, 9 cloze. Balance Bloom''s (5-6 per high level), layers. Make fronts engaging/active
  (e.g., ''Apply: Create a POA&M milestone for...''). Explanations reference objectives/activities/sources. Output ONLY the
  JSON array, no extra text.'
