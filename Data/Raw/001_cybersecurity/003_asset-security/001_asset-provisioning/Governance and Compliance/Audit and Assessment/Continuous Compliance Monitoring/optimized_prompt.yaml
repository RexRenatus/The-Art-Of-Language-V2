  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the shift from reactive periodic audits (prior knowledge from Governance
    and Compliance) to proactive CCM: What are the trade-offs in cost, scalability, and risk reduction? Use examples from
    NIST CSF and Equifax to support arguments.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''CCM is only periodic'' vs.
    continuous), 2) Confusable term (e.g., SIEM vs. SOAR), 3) Partial truth (e.g., lists one standard but misses key ones).
    Ensure distractors promote analysis (e.g., mix traditional vs. continuous methods).'

  **Content Synthesis (use this as source material, ensuring completeness):** CCM ensures real-time adherence to standards
  like NIST CSF (Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover), ISO 27001 (ISMS), COBIT 2019 (governance), CIS Controls, GDPR,
  HIPAA, PCI DSS. Core concepts: CCM (continuous vs. periodic audits), standards/policies. Big picture: Proactive shift in
  asset lifecycle (provisioning-decommissioning). Prior knowledge: Builds on point-in-time audits. Components: GRC, SIEM,
  automation; data flows. 7 Processes: 1.Define Standards; 2.Implement Controls; 3.Integrate; 4.Collect/Analyze; 5.Alert;
  6.Remediate; 7.Review. Integrations: SIEM/SOAR/DevSecOps. Case studies: Equifax (periodic failures). Concept map: CCM →
  Standards → Components → Processes → Integrations → Audit Readiness.


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Align cards to these Learning Objectives [insert full list above]. Use 4 Scaffolding Layers [insert
  full descriptions above]. Incorporate Active Learning [insert summaries above] in explanations (e.g., ''Apply in problem-solving
  exercise'').


  **Generate Flashcards:** Output ONLY a JSON array of 50-100 flashcards following EXACT Flashcard Schema [insert full schema
  above]. Balance: 20% Remember/Understand (Layer 1-2), 30% Apply/Analyze (Layer 2-3), 30% Evaluate (Layer 3-4), 20% Create
  (Layer 4). Vary types: 40% MCQ (w/ distractors), 30% Cloze, 20% Short answer, 10% Diagram/concept map prompts. Ensure university-level:
  active recall, spaced repetition friendly, higher-order thinking. Sources: NIST CSF, ISO 27001, COBIT, web research provided.'
