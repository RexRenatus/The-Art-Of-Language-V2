active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the pros and cons of using X.509 certificates versus alternative identity methods (e.g., symmetric
    keys or tokens) for resource-constrained IoT devices. Consider security, scalability, deployment challenges, and misconceptions
    about certificate overhead.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards following the exact Flashcard Schema:

  - Balance: 10 per Bloom''s level (Remember to Create), cover all layers.

  - Types: 40% MCQ (1 correct + 3 distractors per protocol), 30% Cloze, 20% Short answer, 10% Scenarios.

  - Each card: Front (question + Bloom level), Back (answer, explanation with layer/source/active hook, distractors if MCQ).

  - Ensure university pedagogy: Active recall, misconceptions addressed, voter-approved completeness (AWS workflow, ACME/EST).

  - Output as JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'':
  ''...'', ''distractors'': [...], ''source'': ''...'', ''active_hook'': ''...''}}, ...]


  Prioritize accuracy from sources; make engaging for CISSP/CompTIA Security+ learners.'
