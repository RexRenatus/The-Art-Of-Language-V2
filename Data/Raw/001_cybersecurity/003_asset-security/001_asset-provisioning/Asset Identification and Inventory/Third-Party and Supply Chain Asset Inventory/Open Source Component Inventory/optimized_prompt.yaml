active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In groups of 3-4, debate the feasibility of mandating SBOMs for all software per NTIA guidelines. Consider
    challenges for small organizations versus enterprises, using real-world examples like the SolarWinds supply chain attack.
    Each group presents pros/cons and a recommendation (15-20 minutes).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Open Source Component Inventory\
  \ (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Provisioning > Asset Identification and Inventory > Third-Party\
  \ and Supply Chain Asset Inventory > Open Source Component Inventory).\n\nIncorporate these pedagogical elements:\n- Learning\
  \ Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]\n- Active Learning: Use for scenario-based cards (e.g., 'Based on the discussion\
  \ prompt, what is a key pro of SBOM mandates?')\n- Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL LAYERS FROM ABOVE] - Cards must reference layers\
  \ explicitly.\n\nGenerate flashcards per this schema: [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD_SCHEMA FROM ABOVE].\nOutput ONLY a JSON array\
  \ of 50 flashcards, e.g., [\n  {\n    \"type\": \"multiple_choice\",\n    \"question\": \"...\",\n    \"options\": [\"A.\
