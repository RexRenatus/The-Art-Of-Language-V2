        "core_logic": "Network Protection and User Access Controls work together by controlling communication pathways and authenticating users, respectively. Network protection segments the network and enforces traffic rules, while user access controls verify identity and permissions. This synergy works by ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can communicate through approved network channels, creating a robust defense-in-depth strategy for asset security.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly swap roles or misassign core functions between network protection and user access controls, failing to recognize how controlling communication pathways complements identity verification and permission enforcement.",
        "analogy": "Network protection is like the roads and highways of a city, while user access controls are the security checkpoints and ID scanners at specific buildings; both are needed to manage movement and access securely."
