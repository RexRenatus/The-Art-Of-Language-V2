learning_objectives:
  analyze:
  - objective: Compare and contrast license types and their implications for compliance, such as perpetual vs. subscription
      models.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  understand:
  - objective: Explain the role of software license inventory in ensuring license compliance, cost optimization, and risk
      mitigation within Software Asset Management (SAM).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Classify different types of software licenses (e.g., perpetual, subscription, open-source) in a given organizational
      scenario.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  evaluate:
  - objective: Assess the risks of non-compliance with software licenses (e.g., fines, audits) and prioritize mitigation strategies.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  create:
  - objective: Design a step-by-step process for creating and maintaining a software license inventory, integrating automation
      tools.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  remember:
  - objective: Recall the definition of software license inventory and its key components (e.g., software title, version,
      license type, quantity, expiration).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In groups, discuss real-world consequences of software license non-compliance (e.g., Microsoft SAM audits
    resulting in millions in fines). How does a robust license inventory prevent this? Share examples from your experience
    or news.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate high-quality flashcards for ''Software
  License Inventory'' using university pedagogy (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning scaffolding).


  **Topic Context:** Category: Cybersecurity | Domain: Asset Security | Subdomain: Asset Provisioning | Entry Domain: Asset
  Identification and Inventory | Entry Subdomain: Software Asset Inventory. Full Hierarchy: Level 1: Cybersecurity - Level
  2: Asset Security - Level 3: Asset Provisioning - Level 4: Asset Identification and Inventory - Level 5: Software Asset
  Inventory - Level 6: Software License Inventory.


  **Incorporate Exactly:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste full learning_objectives JSON here].

  - Scaffolding Layers: [Paste full scaffolding JSON here, including prior knowledge, assessments, CIS Controls completion
  (Control 2 full subcontrols), ISO 19770, examples like Microsoft SAM audits]. Sources: CIS Controls v8 (cisecurity.org),
  ISO/IEC 19770 (iso.org), Flexera/Snow docs.

  - Active Learning: Draw questions from discussion/peer/problem-solving for engagement.


  **Generate 25 flashcards per flashcard_schema:** Strictly follow structure/output_format. Balance coverage. Every card tags
  bloom_level, layer, hierarchy. MCQs: EXACTLY 3 distractors (plausible via protocol). Explanations: 2-4 sentences, tie to
  objectives/standards/real-world. Ensure active recall (no direct quotes). Vary difficulty progressively (foundation to integration).'
