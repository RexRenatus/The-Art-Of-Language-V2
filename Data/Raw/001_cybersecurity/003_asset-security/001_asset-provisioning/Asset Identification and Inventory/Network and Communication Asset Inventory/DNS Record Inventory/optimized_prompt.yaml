active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate how incomplete DNS inventories contribute to real-world risks like subdomain
    takeovers (e.g., CISA alerts on DNS abuse in ransomware campaigns) and propose mitigation strategies tied to zero-trust
    architectures.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Content Context (Completed Research):** [Insert full research summary here, including core concepts, ecosystem (registrars,
  NS, resolvers, zone files), record types, inventory definition, tools (dig, nslookup, axfr, DNSdumpster, SecurityTrails),
  step-by-step process, CISA alerts (e.g., DNS in ransomware C2), sources (NIST SP 800-53 ID.AM-1/2, CIS Control 1, ISO 27001
  A.8.1.1)]. Big picture: Prevents subdomain takeovers, shadow IT; supports zero-trust.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Paste full list from above].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Paste full scaffolding from above].


  **Active Learning Ties:** Ensure cards prompt recall for discussions (e.g., risks), peer teaching (definitions), problem-solving
  (scenarios).


  Generate 50 flashcards per the schema: Structure front/back as specified, distractors per protocol, cover all layers/objectives
  evenly. Output as JSON array of objects. Each card must be precise, educational, and traceable to sources. Promote mastery
  in asset security.'
