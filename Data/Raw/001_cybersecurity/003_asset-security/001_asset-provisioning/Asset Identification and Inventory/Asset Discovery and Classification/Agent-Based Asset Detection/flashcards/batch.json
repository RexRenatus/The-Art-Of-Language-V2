        "core_logic": "By providing a comprehensive and accurate list of all assets, agent-based detection helps identify 'shadow IT' (unauthorized devices or software) and ensures that all known assets are considered for security patching and configuration management. This visibility is crucial because unmanaged assets are often unpatched and represent significant security risks.",
