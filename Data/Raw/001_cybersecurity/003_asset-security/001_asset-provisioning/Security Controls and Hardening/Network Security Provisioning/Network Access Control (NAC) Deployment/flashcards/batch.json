      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "ZTA's core principle is 'never trust, always verify,' meaning every access request is treated as potentially hostile, because implicit trust is removed. NAC is a critical enabler of ZTA by functioning as a Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) that verifies identity and posture before granting access, aligning with ZTA's continuous verification requirement.",
