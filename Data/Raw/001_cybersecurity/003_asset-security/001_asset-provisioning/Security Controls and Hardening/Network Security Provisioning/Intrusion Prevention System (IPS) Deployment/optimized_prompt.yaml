active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, assign each partner one of the four IDPS classes (Network-Based, Wireless, NBA, Host-Based). The
    teacher explains the class using a hand-drawn diagram, key NIST SP 800-94 characteristics, and deployment considerations;
    the partner quizzes with 3 questions and teaches back to confirm understanding.
  problem_solving: 'In groups, given a real-world scenario (e.g., an e-commerce site facing DDoS attacks and remote access
    needs), design an IPS deployment plan: select IDPS class(es), justify per NIST SP 800-94, simulate traffic analysis steps,
    integrate with firewalls/zero-trust, and present trade-offs.'

    rules:
    - 'Plausible but incorrect: e.g., for IPS definition, distractor ''Monitors only without blocking'' (that''s IDS).'
    - 'Common errors: Mix classes (e.g., ''Wireless IDPS analyzes wired traffic''), truncate NIST steps.'
    - 'Balanced: 1 subtle (near-miss), 1 obvious wrong, 1 attractive misconception from research (e.g., ignore NBA for behavior
      analysis).'
    - 'Avoid randomness: Ground in web research/voter suggestions (e.g., false positives in host-based).'
    coverage: 20% pure recall (no distractors), 50% MCQ, 30% cloze. Ensure even distribution across objectives/layers.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Intrusion Prevention System
  (IPS) Deployment (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Provisioning > Security Controls and Hardening
  > Network Security Provisioning > IPS Deployment). Use the provided research context, voter consensus (82.9% approval),
  and pedagogical structure to create optimized Anki-style flashcards.


  **Research Context (Embed Fully):** IDS monitors for incidents; IPS detects and prevents; IDPS combines both (NIST SP 800-94).
  Four IDPS classes: Network-Based (network traffic), Wireless (wireless protocols), NBA (behavior analysis), Host-Based (host
  events). NIST SP 800-94 guides deployment: planning, placement, config, monitoring. NIST SP 800-53: SI-4 monitoring, SC-7
  boundaries, AU-2 logging, etc. Best practices: inline deployment, tuning false positives, zero-trust integration.


  **Learning Objectives (Cover Evenly):** [Insert the 6 objectives above].


  **Scaffolding Layers (Distribute Cards):** [Insert the 4 layers above].


  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Flashcards should prompt recall usable in discussions (e.g., trade-offs), peer teaching (diagrams/classes),
  problem-solving (scenarios).


  **Flashcard Schema (Strict Output Format):** Generate 50 flashcards in JSON array: [{''id'':1, ''front'':''...'', ''back'':{''answer'':''...'',
  ''explanation'':''...'', ''distractors'':[''A:...'',''B:...''] if MCQ, ''tags'':[''REMEMBER'',''Layer1'',''NIST SP 800-94'']}}].
  Follow distractor protocol exactly. Mix types: 40% Q&A, 40% MCQ, 20% cloze. Ensure progression: 25% Layer1, 25% Layer2,
  25% Layer3, 25% Layer4. Bloom''s coverage: balanced across levels. Link to big picture (asset lifecycle, zero-trust). Output
  ONLY the JSON array – no extra text.'
