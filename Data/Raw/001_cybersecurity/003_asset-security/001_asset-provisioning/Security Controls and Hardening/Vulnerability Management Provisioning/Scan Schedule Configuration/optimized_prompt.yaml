active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of implementing daily vulnerability scans for high-risk
    assets versus weekly scans for others, considering factors like resource impact, detection timeliness, and compliance
    with NIST RA-5 and FedRAMP. Cite specific examples from CISA asset inventory guidance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol:
    rules: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions:'
    examples:
    - Wrong frequency (e.g., 'annual' instead of 'monthly' for FedRAMP).
    - Misattributed standard (e.g., CIS frequency for NIST control).
    - Overly aggressive timing (e.g., 'peak hours' vs. 'off-peak').
    - Ignoring prerequisites (e.g., no asset inventory mention).
    ensure: Distractors are realistic (from research/voter suggestions), one partially correct to test analysis.

  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Provisioning > Security Controls and Hardening > Vulnerability Management

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema. Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives (spanning Bloom''s: Remember to Create).

  - Active learning ties (e.g., reference discussion debates in explanations).

  - 4-layer scaffolding (tag each card with layer).

  - Voter priorities: FedRAMP details (monthly scans, reporting), prerequisites (asset inventory), best practices (daily high-risk/off-peak/automation,
  NIST/CIS examples), concept map flows.

  - Research: NIST RA-5 (periodic/random scans), CISA asset inventory/taxonomy, vulnerability management cycle.
