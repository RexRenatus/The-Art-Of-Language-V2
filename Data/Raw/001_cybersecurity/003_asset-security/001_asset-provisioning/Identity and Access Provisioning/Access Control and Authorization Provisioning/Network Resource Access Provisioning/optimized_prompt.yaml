active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the implementation of Zero Trust Architecture versus traditional VPN-based access in a hybrid
    work environment. Consider factors like security, user experience, and implementation costs. Provide arguments for and
    against each approach.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains the full lifecycle of access provisioning (granting, managing, revoking) using
    the least privilege principle, while drawing a diagram of network resources. The partner then teaches it back with a modified
    scenario (e.g., adding a new employee). Switch roles.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario of a mid-sized company with on-prem servers and cloud apps facing insider threat risks,
    students design a network resource access provisioning policy incorporating NIST SP 800-207 ZTA principles. Include authentication
    methods, authorization rules, and a review cadence. Present and critique peer designs.

    (e.g., ''trust inside perimeter''), 2) Partial truth (e.g., ''VPN is always secure''), 3) Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g.,
    ''deny all access''). Ensure plausible, derived from real standards/misuses. Explain distractors in ''explanation''.'

  **Research Context (Complete):** Network resource access provisioning grants/denies access to resources (servers, apps,
  databases, cloud services) based on policies, attributes. Key: Authentication (verify identity, NIST SP 800-63), Authorization
  (permissions), Least Privilege (min access needed, NIST SP 800-53 AC-6), ZTA (''never trust, always verify'' per-session,
  NIST SP 800-207). Lifecycle: Grant (provision), Manage (review), Revoke. Standards: NIST SP 800-53 Rev5 (AC-2 Account Mgmt,
  AC-6 Least Privilege); NIST SP 800-207 ZTA; ISO/IEC 27001 A.9 Access Control. Sources: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf,
  https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf, https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63-3.pdf.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives from above].


  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Reference discussion (ZTA vs VPN), peer teaching (lifecycle diagrams), problem-solving (policy
  design) in explanations.


  **Scaffolding:** Generate 5-8 flashcards per layer: [Insert the 4 scaffolding layers from above].


  **Flashcard Generation Rules:**

  - Cover all objectives across layers/Bloom''s levels.

  - 60% MCQ (with distractors per protocol), 20% definition/cloze, 20% scenario/application.

  - Promote active recall: Questions test retrieval, not recognition.

  - University pedagogy: Scaffold from simple to complex; include peer-discussion hooks.

  - Output EXACTLY as JSON array per schema: [Insert full flashcard_schema.structure].

  - Ensure completeness: All cards reference standards/sources; distractors realistic.

  - Voter Consensus: 100% approval on completeness, pedagogy, activities – prioritize NIST/ZTA/least privilege.
