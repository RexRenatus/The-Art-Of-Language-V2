active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a mid-sized company handling sensitive customer data, debate the trade-offs between implementing strict
    Separation of Duties (SoD) in privileged access provisioning versus operational efficiency. What real-world examples from
    NIST SP 800-53r5 or SOX compliance illustrate potential fraud risks if SoD is ignored? Categorize scenarios where SoD
    is essential versus optional. (Encourages critical thinking, addresses misconceptions that SoD is only financial, and
    promotes compare/contrast.)
  peer_teaching: 'Pair up and use the teach-back method: Student A explains core SoD concepts (e.g., conflict of interest
    prevention per NIST AC-5) with a non-example (single admin handling access requests and audits), then Student B rephrases
    and provides an example from asset provisioning. Switch roles. (Enhances understanding through explanation and active
    recall.)'
  problem_solving: Given a real-world scenario of a healthcare organization's identity provisioning process, groups must map
    roles to prevent any single person from requesting, approving, and implementing privileged access. Use NIST SP 800-53r5
    AC-5 as a guide; identify violations and redesign with a SoD matrix. Present solutions. (Applies concepts practically
    with high real-world relevance.)

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: Use to inspire scenario-based cards (e.g., discussion trade-offs, peer teach-backs, healthcare problem-solving).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across layers (tag each: Layer1_Foundation, etc.), build prior knowledge links.

  - Big Picture: Emphasize insider threat reduction, NIST AC-5, SOX compliance.
