  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one explains JIT vs. permanent roles in ARA (using NIST SP 800-162 attributes), then switch for
    teach-back. Peers quiz each other on enforcement of least privilege.
  problem_solving: 'Design ARA rules for a hospital scenario: Assign roles to doctors/nurses based on attributes (shift, department,
    patient sensitivity) to enforce least privilege. Solve for edge cases like emergencies, then peer-review for NIST compliance.'

  **Completed Research Context:**

  Automated Role Assignment (ARA) automates granting roles/permissions based on rules/attributes, enhancing IAM efficiency
  and security.


  Core Concepts: Role (permissions set); ARA (auto-assignment via policies); IAM (right access framework); ABAC (attribute-based:
  user/resource/action/environment); RBAC (role-based); JIT Access (temporary privileges).


  Standards:

  - NIST SP 800-162: ABAC Implementation Guide – Policies as Boolean functions of attributes for fine-grained control.

  - NIST SP 800-207: Zero Trust Architecture – Dynamic, JIT ARA essential.

  - NIST SP 800-53: AC controls.

  - ISO/IEC 27001: Annex A.9 Access control.

  - CIS Controls: Automated access provisioning.


  Best Practices:

  1. Map attributes to roles (dept, location, time).

  2. Use tools: Okta (Workflows), SailPoint (IdentityIQ), Saviynt.

  3. Enforce least privilege/JIT.

  4. Audit/monitor.

  Pitfalls: Complex policies, stale attributes, privilege creep.


  Real-world: Hospitals use ABAC-ARA for HIPAA-compliant patient data access.
