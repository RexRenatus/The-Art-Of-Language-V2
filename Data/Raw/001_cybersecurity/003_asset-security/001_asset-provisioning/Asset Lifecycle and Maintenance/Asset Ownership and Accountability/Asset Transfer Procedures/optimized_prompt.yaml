active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the potential risks of improper asset transfer (e.g., data leakage during
    relocation or reuse) and propose mitigation strategies based on NIST SP 800-53 MP-6 and SP 800-88. Consider real-world
    scenarios like employee offboarding or hardware relocation, and vote on the most critical control.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Asset Security. Topic:
  Asset Transfer Procedures (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Asset Provisioning > Asset Lifecycle and Maintenance
  > Asset Ownership and Accountability > Asset Transfer Procedures). Use voter consensus (82.9% approval): Emphasize NIST
  SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (MP-6 Media Sanitization, MP-2 Media Access), NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1 (Clear/Purge/Destroy techniques), full
  citations, asset lifecycle integration, prerequisites (classification/inventory/ownership).
