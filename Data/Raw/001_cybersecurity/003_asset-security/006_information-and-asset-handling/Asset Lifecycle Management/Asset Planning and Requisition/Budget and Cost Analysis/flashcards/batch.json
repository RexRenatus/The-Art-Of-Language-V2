        "core_logic": "Integrating CSRM into ERM ensures that cybersecurity budgeting is not an isolated activity but is strategically aligned with the organization's overall mission and risk posture. This holistic approach allows for better prioritization of asset protection investments based on their contribution to enterprise objectives and acceptable risk levels.",
