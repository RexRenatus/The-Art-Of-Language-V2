active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given limited resources, debate whether to harden all systems uniformly or prioritize critical assets,
    using CIS Benchmarks as reference. Consider trade-offs in security vs. usability, and reference dependencies on asset
    inventory and prior knowledge of the CIA triad.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ types (20% of cards): Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g.,
    for ''What reduces attack surface?'': Distractors like ''Adding more services'' or ''Ignoring patches''). Ensure correct
    answer is grounded in CIS Benchmarks/NIST; distractors from research pitfalls like over-focusing on usability.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy\
  \ (Bloom's Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Topic: System Hardening Procedures (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset\
  \ Security > Information and Asset Handling > Secure Provisioning of Assets > Asset Configuration and Hardening > System\
  \ Hardening Procedures). Consensus-approved (82.9%) with voter priorities integrated.\n\nCore Content: System hardening\
  \ reduces attack surface by eliminating unnecessary services, ports, accounts; uses CIS Benchmarks (OS configs), NIST, ISO\
  \ 27001. Examples: Disable services (e.g., SMBv1), patch vulnerabilities, least privilege. Prior knowledge: OS admin, networking,\
  \ CIA triad. Concept map: 'System Hardening' → Attack Surface Reduction, CIS Benchmarks, Standards (NIST/ISO), Asset Inventory.\n\
  \nLearning Objectives (span Bloom's):\n1. Remember: Define terms (hardening, attack surface).\n2. Understand: Explain CIS\
  \ Benchmarks.\n3. Apply: Demo procedures (checklists).\n4. Analyze: Compare frameworks.\n5. Evaluate: Critique configs.\n\
  6. Create: Design plans.\n\nScaffolding Layers:\n- L1 Foundation: Definitions, prior knowledge, concept map.\n- L2 Components:\
  \ Elements (services/ports/accounts), frameworks.\n- L3 Implementation: Steps (CIS application, examples).\n- L4 Integration:\
  \ Automation, continuous hardening.\n\nActive Learning Ties: Include cards prompting discussion (resource trade-offs), peer\
  \ teaching (OS comparisons), problem-solving (e.g., e-commerce breach scenarios).\n\nGenerate 40 flashcards following this\
  \ exact schema per card (output as JSON array):\n{\n  \"front\": \"Question or cloze (e.g., 'System hardening reduces the\
  \ ____ by disabling unnecessary ____.' )\",\n  \"back\": \"Concise answer (e.g., 'attack surface; services')\",\n  \"explanation\"\
