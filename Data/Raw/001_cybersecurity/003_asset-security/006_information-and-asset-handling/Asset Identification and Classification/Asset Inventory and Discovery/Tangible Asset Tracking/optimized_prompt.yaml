active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, analyze how inadequate tangible asset tracking contributed to real-world supply
    chain attacks like SolarWinds. Debate the role of provenance tracking in zero-trust architectures and propose preventive
    measures tied to NIST standards.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse tangible with intangible
    assets); 2) Partial truth (e.g., valid for lifecycle but not tracking); 3) Extreme/outdated view (e.g., ignore NIST updates).
    Ensure distractors test deeper understanding, not trivia.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in 'Tangible Asset Tracking'\
  \ (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and Asset Handling > Asset Identification and Classification\
  \ > Asset Inventory and Discovery > Tangible Asset Tracking). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning components,\
  \ 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema to create 50 high-quality flashcards (10-15 per Bloom's level pair: Remember/Understand,\
  \ Apply/Analyze, Evaluate/Create).\n\nIncorporate:\n- Voter consensus: Completeness (full NIST SA controls: SA-3, SA-8,\
  \ SA-10; sources populated); Pedagogy (Bloom's progression); Prior knowledge (asset types); Big picture (SolarWinds, zero-trust).\n\
  - Research: Tangible assets, lifecycle, inventory, tracking, tamper detection, provenance; NIST SP 800-53 SA family, 800-161r1.\n\
  \nOutput ONLY in JSON array of flashcards, each as:\n{\n  'bloom_level': 'REMEMBER',\n  'scaffolding_layer': 1,\n  'front':\
  \ 'Question text...',\n  'back': {\n    'answer': '...',\n    'explanation': '...',\n    'active_tie': '...',\n    'source':\
