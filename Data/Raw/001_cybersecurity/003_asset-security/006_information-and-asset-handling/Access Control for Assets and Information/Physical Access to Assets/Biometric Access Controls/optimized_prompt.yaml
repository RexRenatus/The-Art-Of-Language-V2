  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, Student A explains the enrollment process (capture -> template -> store) versus authentication
    (live scan -> match -> decision) using a smartphone's Face ID as an example, including IAL/AAL interplay. Student B then
    teaches back behavioral biometrics (e.g., gait analysis, voice patterns) and quizzes Student A on differences and real-world
    applications.
  problem_solving: In groups, design a biometric access control system for a corporate headquarters (e.g., iris + palm vein
    for executive floors). Calculate hypothetical FAR/FRR impacts (e.g., FAR < 1 in 10^4 for AAL3), propose multi-factor integration
    (e.g., with PIN), and reference real-world failures like airport e-gates. Present risk mitigations like liveness detection.

    rules:
    - Distractors must be plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse FAR with FRR; mix physical/behavioral; wrong
      NIST levels).
    - '1 distractor: Semantic opposite (e.g., high FAR for low-security).'
    - '1 distractor: Common mix-up (e.g., enrollment as authentication).'
    - '1 distractor: Edge case/extreme (e.g., zero FAR unrealistic).'
    - 'Balance coverage: 60% MCQs across layers, 20% higher Bloom''s (analyze/evaluate/create as open-ended).'
    - 'Generate 40-60 flashcards: 10 per layer, mixed objectives.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Biometric Access Controls
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and Asset Handling > Access Control for Assets and Information
  > Physical Access to Assets > Biometric Access Controls).


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema. Integrate:

  - Learning objectives (span Bloom''s: REMEMBER to CREATE as listed).

  - Scaffolding (Layer 1-4 content exactly; ~12 cards per layer, progressive).

  - Active learning (include 5-10 cards tying to discussion/peer/problem-solving, e.g., hospital debate, Face ID example,
  corporate design).

  - Research context: NIST SP 800-63-4/800-76-2 (full PIV specs: fingerprints minutiae FAR≤0.01%, face FAR≤0.1%, iris FAR≤0.0001%),
  FAR/FRR, liveness, GDPR.


  Output ONLY in JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''correct_answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''1-4'', ''references'': ''...''}}, ...].


  Schema strictly: MCQ fronts with 4 options (label A-D, bold correct); backs with full explanation/distractor rationale.
  Distractors plausible per protocol. Ensure university-level pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, no hints
  on front.'
