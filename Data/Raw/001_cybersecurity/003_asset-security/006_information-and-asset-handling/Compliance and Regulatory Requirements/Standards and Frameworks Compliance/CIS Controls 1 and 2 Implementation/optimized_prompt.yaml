    inventory), 2) Partial truth (e.g., valid for another control), 3) Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., ignore cloud assets).
    Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter-noted misconceptions like shadow IT or patching confusion.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for university-level cybersecurity education. Generate 30 high-quality
  flashcards (15 basic Q&A, 15 MCQ) on ''CIS Controls 1 and 2 Implementation'' (Category: Cybersecurity, Domain: Asset Security,
  Subdomain: Information and Asset Handling, Entry: Compliance and Regulatory Requirements, Standards and Frameworks Compliance).
  Topic Hierarchy: Level 1 Cybersecurity > Level 2 Asset Security > Level 3 Information and Asset Handling > Level 4 Compliance
  and Regulatory Requirements > Level 5 Standards and Frameworks Compliance > Level 6 CIS Controls 1 and 2 Implementation.


  Incorporate these elements for optimized pedagogy:

  - Learning Objectives: [REMEMBER: List key components... CREATE: Design plan...] (Distribute flashcards across Bloom''s
  levels: 30% remember/understand, 40% apply/analyze, 30% evaluate/create).

  - Active Learning: Weave in discussion (small biz feasibility), peer teaching (diagram/switch), problem-solving (shadow
  IT audit) as example prompts in explanations.

  - Scaffolding: Layer 1 Foundation (definitions, prior knowledge: ITIL/assets), Layer 2 Components (sub-controls/CAS), Layer
  3 Implementation (steps/tools), Layer 4 Integration (NIST/links). Tag each flashcard with layer (e.g., #Layer1).

  - Big Picture: Foundational controls (1st of 18 CIS), compliance (NIST/ISO), 80%+ attack surface reduction.

  - Research Context: Enterprise assets (devices/IoT/cloud), software assets (OS/apps), inventory/control, unauthorized risks.
  CIS v8.1, CAS for assessment. Tools: Nessus/SCCM. Examples: SolarWinds, shadow IT.


  Use Flashcard Schema:

  - Basic: {''front'': ''Q'', ''back'': ''A'', ''bloom_level'': ''Remember'', ''layer'': ''1'', ''explanation'': ''Detailed...''}

  - MCQ: {''front'': ''Q\nA) ... B) ... C) ... D) ...'', ''correct'': ''A: Explanation'', ''distractors'': {''B'': ''Why wrong...'',
  ...}, ''bloom_level'': ''Analyze'', ''layer'': ''3'', ''full_explanation'': ''...''}


  Distractors: Plausible (misconceptions, partial truths, extremes). Explanations: 50-100 words, reference objectives/activities/sources.
  Voter Consensus: 100% approval on completeness/pedagogy. Ensure comprehensive CAS coverage, full sources (CIS Controls v8.1,
  CAS IGs). Output as JSON array of 30 flashcards.'
