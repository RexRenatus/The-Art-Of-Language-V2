active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the potential consequences of failing a compliance audit in asset security
    (e.g., regulatory fines, reputational damage). How do frameworks like NIST CSF and ISO 27001 mitigate these risks? Support
    your arguments with examples from real-world breaches like SolarWinds (related to supply chain risks in NIST SP 800-161).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ cards (70% of total): Create 4 options (1 correct, 3 distractors). Distractors must be plausible
    (e.g., common misconceptions, partial truths, related but incorrect frameworks like confusing NIST SP 800-53 with SP 800-171).
    Base on real standards variances (e.g., distractor: ''ISO 27001 focuses only on physical assets'' vs. correct broad scope).
    Ensure no giveaways; randomize order.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  Compliance Audit Preparation (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and Asset Handling > Compliance and
  Regulatory Requirements > Audit and Documentation > Compliance Audit Preparation). Use this synthesized research context:


  Core Concepts: [Insert full Layer 1-4 content from scaffolding_layers above]. Standards: NIST CSF, SP 800-53 (asset controls),
  SP 800-161 Rev1 (supply chain risk mgmt), ISO 27001 (A.8 assets), CIS Controls v8 (asset inventory), PCI DSS (configs/access).
  Practical steps: [Layer 3]. Sources: NIST SP 800-53 (csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final), SP 800-161 (csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/161/r1/final),
  ISO 27001 (iso.org/standard/27001), CIS (cisecurity.org/controls).


  Incorporate pedagogy: Learning Objectives: [paste learning_objectives array]. Active Learning: Use in explanations [paste
  active_learning]. Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [reference scaffolding_layers content].


  Generate flashcards per schema: [paste flashcard_schema]. Ensure university-level: Bloom''s progression, active recall,
  spaced repetition friendly. Balance: 20% Remember/Understand (Layer1-2), 30% Apply (Layer3), 30% Analyze/Evaluate (Layer3-4),
  20% Create (Layer4). Vary types: 70% MCQ w/distractors, 20% Q&A, 10% Cloze. Output ONLY valid JSON array of cards.'
