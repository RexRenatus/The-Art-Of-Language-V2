active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In an organization handling personal data under GDPR, should teams always fulfill DSARs within the 1-month
    timeline, even if it risks exposing sensitive asset information via disproportionate effort exemptions? Debate the trade-offs
    between compliance, efficiency, and security, using real-world examples like the British Airways data breach and NIST
    SP 800-171 access control principles.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    1 month); 2) Confusable term (e.g., CCPA vs. GDPR exemption rules); 3) Extreme/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Always grant
    full access'' ignoring least privilege). Ensure distractors test analysis/evaluation, grounded in research/voter accuracy

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  Right to Access Procedures (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and Asset Handling > Compliance and
  Regulatory Requirements > Data Protection Regulations > Right to Access Procedures). Focus on data subject rights (GDPR
  Art. 15 DSARs: access personal data, timelines 1mo/extendable, ID verification, exemptions) integrated with asset security
  (least privilege, NIST SP 800-171 AC family, SP 1800-28 practices).


  Prior Knowledge: CIA triad, authentication/authorization.

  Big Picture: Ensures compliance, prevents breaches, masters asset protection.
