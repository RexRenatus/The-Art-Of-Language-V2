active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the consequences of a broken chain of custody in a cybersecurity incident
    response scenario involving physical media transfer (e.g., a hard drive from a compromised site). Identify at least three
    preventive measures and justify their priority based on risk to asset integrity.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Asset Security (Domain:

  Custody for Media). Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and Asset Handling > Media Handling and
  Protection > Media Transfer and Transportation > Chain of Custody for Media.


  Incorporate this research context: Chain of Custody (CoC) tracks media assets (e.g., USBs, HDDs) via documentation (who/what/when/where/why/how)
  to ensure integrity/accountability. Broken CoC risks tampering. Standards: NIST SP 800-88 (sanitization), SP 800-53 (audit
  protection), CISA Insights (CoC for CI), ISO 27001 A.8.3, CIS v8 Control 4. Sources: cisa.gov/insights_chain-of-custody-and-ci-systems_508.pdf.


  Use these exact learning objectives (Bloom''s progression), active learning activities, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard
  schema provided below. Prioritize voter consensus: pedagogy (Bloom''s, scaffolding), completeness (NIST/standards, examples
  like USB handoffs).
