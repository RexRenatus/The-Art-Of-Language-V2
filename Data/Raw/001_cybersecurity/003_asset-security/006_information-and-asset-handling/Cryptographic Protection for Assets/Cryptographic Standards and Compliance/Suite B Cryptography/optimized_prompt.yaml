  **Topic Summary (Complete & Authoritative):** Suite B Cryptography: NSA''s standardized algorithms for U.S. government (unclassified
  to Top Secret). Superseded by CNSA Suite. Core: AES-128/256 (FIPS 197 symmetric encryption); ECDH (key agreement, NIST P-256/P-384
  per SP 800-56A); ECDSA (signatures, P-256/P-384 per FIPS 186-4); SHA-256/384 (hashes, FIPS 180-4 Secure Hash Standard).
  Secret: 128-bit AES, P-256, SHA-256; Top Secret: 256-bit AES, P-384, SHA-384. Implementation: OpenSSL e.g., `openssl req
  -newkey ecparam -pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:prime256v1 -keyout privkey.pem -pubout`. Transition: CNSA adds longer keys, quantum
  prep. Sources: NSA Suite B (cnss.gov), NIST FIPS 180-4/186-4/197, SP 800-57/56A.


  **Prior Knowledge Link:** Builds on AES symmetric, RSA/ECC asymmetric basics.


  **Instructions:**

  1. Generate EXACTLY 24 flashcards in a JSON array.

  2. Distribute: 1 per objective, balanced layers (6 per layer).

  3. Incorporate active learning: Weave discussion/problem-solving into 20% explanations.

  4. Ensure pedagogical progression: Scaffolding from foundation to integration.

  5. Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcard objects matching the schema EXACTLY (no extra fields). Topic_hierarchy must
  be identical copy.

  6. Questions: 70% multiple-choice (question + 4 options incl. answer), 30% cloze/short-answer.

  7. Distractors: Strictly 3, plausible, explained in explanation field.


  Schema reminder: {question, answer, distractors: [3 strings], explanation, bloom_level, scaffolding_layer, topic_hierarchy}.
