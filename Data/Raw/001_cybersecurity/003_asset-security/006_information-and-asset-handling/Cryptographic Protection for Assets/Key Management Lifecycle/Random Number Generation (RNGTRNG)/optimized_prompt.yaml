  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''PRNGs are sufficient for most cryptographic applications
    if seeded properly.'' Use real-world examples like TLS handshakes or blockchain wallets to support your position, referencing
    NIST SP 800-90 standards and common pitfalls such as seed predictability.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''PRNG is truly random''), 2) Partial
    truth (e.g., valid for non-crypto but not crypto), 3) Extreme/edge case (e.g., ignores min-entropy). Ensure plausible
    for cybersecurity learners; avoid obvious wrongs.'

  Topic: Random Number Generation (RNG/TRNG) under Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and Asset Handling > Cryptographic
  Protection for Assets > Key Management Lifecycle > RNG/TRNG. Voter Consensus (100% approval): Emphasize clarity (e.g., Min-entropy:
  ''quantifies the negative log of the probability of the most likely outcome''), complete NIST SP 800-90A/B/C details (A:
  DRBGs, B: entropy estimation/validation, C: planting), prior knowledge (crypto basics, info theory), big picture (TLS, blockchain,
  attacks), concept map (RNG/TRNG central → TRNG/PRNG branches → entropy/NIST → keys).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Active Learning: Tie explanations to discussion/peer teaching/problems (e.g., ''Apply in blockchain scenario'').

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers [insert full scaffolding above]; tag each card with layer.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using this schema [insert full flashcard_schema above]. Ensure university-level pedagogy:
  Bloom''s progression, active recall, spaced repetition friendly. Use research context: TRNG (physical e.g., thermal noise),
  CSPRNG (unpredictable PRNG), entropy/min-entropy/seed defs. Output ONLY in JSON array of objects, each: {''front'': ''...'',
  ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'', ''opt3''], ''scaffolding_layer'':
  ''Layer X'', ''source'': ''...'', ''blooms_level'': ''Remember/etc''}}. Vary difficulty; fix any truncations for completeness.'
