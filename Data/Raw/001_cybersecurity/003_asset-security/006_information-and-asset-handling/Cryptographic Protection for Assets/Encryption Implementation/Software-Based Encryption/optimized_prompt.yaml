active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios would you choose symmetric encryption over asymmetric, and vice versa? Debate the trade-offs
    in speed, security, and key management for protecting corporate assets, using real-world examples like HTTPS (TLS handshake)
    or full-disk encryption (BitLocker). Reference NIST SP 800-57 for key management best practices.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards (20 basic/Q&A, 15 cloze deletions, 15 MCQs) covering the full topic. Distribute evenly:
  12 Layer 1, 13 Layer 2, 13 Layer 3, 12 Layer 4; span all Bloom''s levels (8-10 per objective).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Embed elements (e.g., cards prompting discussion scenarios, peer-teach explanations, problem-solving
  flaws).

  - Scaffolding: [INSERT FULL LAYERS FROM ABOVE] – Tag each card with layer.

  - Core Content: Definitions (encryption/decryption/keys/symmetric/AES/asymmetric/RSA/plaintext/ciphertext); NIST SP 800-57
  Pt3 (key lifecycle, application recs); FIPS 140-3; Python/Java impl examples; Hybrid systems; Trade-offs (speed/security).

  - Prior Knowledge: CIA triad confidentiality, data classification.


  Strictly follow Flashcard Schema: [INSERT FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Output a JSON array of 50 flashcards. Ensure active learning
  tie-ins (e.g., ''Debate: When use symmetric?''), measurable pedagogy, web-grounded (cite sources with URLs), and distractors
  for engagement. No duplicates; vary difficulty.'
