active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between rapid asset restoration (e.g., using unverified
    backups) versus thorough validation for integrity in a ransomware scenario. Reference NIST SP 800-184 guidelines and real-world
    examples like the Colonial Pipeline attack to support arguments on resilience impacts.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 distractors per MCQ: (1) Semantic trap (similar term, e.g., ''Detect'' instead of ''Recover''),
    (2) Common misconception (e.g., ''Always pay ransom for quick recovery''), (3) Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g.,
    ''Restoration ignores backups''). Base on voter-noted gaps, real-world errors (e.g., unverified backups in ransomware),
    and NIST distinctions.'

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste full array from above].

  - Active Learning: [Paste summaries from above] – weave into explanations.

  - Scaffolding: 4 layers [Paste full scaffolding from above] – categorize flashcards accordingly (10-15 per layer).

  - Prior knowledge: Assume familiarity with NIST Detect/Respond phases.

  - Sources: NIST CSF Recover (planning, improvements); NIST SP 800-184 (Guide for Cybersecurity Event Recovery: recovery
  planning, event recovery processes—prioritize assets, restore/validate, communications—lessons learned); real-world (ransomware
  cases); big picture (resilience, maturity).

  - Concept Map: Central ''Asset Recovery & Restoration'' → NIST Recover → Planning/Processes/Lessons → Prerequisites (Incident
  Response) → Outcomes (Resilience).


  Generate flashcards using exact schema: [Paste full flashcard_schema.structure]. Follow distractor protocol and explanation
  requirements strictly.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''id'':1, ...}, ...]. Ensure 100% consensus alignment: complete, factual, progressive
  Bloom''s (Remember 20%, Understand 20%, Apply 20%, Analyze 15%, Evaluate 15%, Create 10%). High-quality, exam-ready (e.g.,
  CISSP-style).'
