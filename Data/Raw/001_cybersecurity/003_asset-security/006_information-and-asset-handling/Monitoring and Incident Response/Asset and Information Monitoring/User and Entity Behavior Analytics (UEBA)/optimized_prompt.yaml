  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the ethical implications of UEBA: Does constant behavioral monitoring infringe on employee privacy
    more than it enhances security? Use examples of risk scoring for anomalies (e.g., unusual data exfiltration) to argue
    pros (e.g., early APT detection) and cons (e.g., false positives leading to unwarranted investigations).'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Use this comprehensive content:

  - Research summary: UEBA uses ML/AI to detect anomalies from behavioral baselines for users (UBA) and entities (EBA like
  servers/IoT). Key: baselining, anomaly detection (e.g., unusual logins/data exfiltration), risk scoring, alerting. Superior
  to rule-based for insider threats/APTs.

  - Prerequisites: Logs, IDS/IPS, basic ML/anomaly detection.

  - Scaffolding: [Insert full scaffolding from above].

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full list].

  - Active Learning: Incorporate concepts from discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving for scenario cards.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following the exact schema:

  - Cover all Bloom''s levels and layers proportionally.

  - 40% MCQs with 4 options (1 correct, 3 distractors per protocol).

  - Ensure active recall: Questions test application/analysis.

  - Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''distractors'':
  [''A'',''B'',''C''] if MCQ}, ''metadata'': {...}}].

  - Make explanations formative: Link to objectives, correct misconceptions, suggest active learning tie-ins.

  - Optimize for Anki/Quizlet: Concise fronts, rich backs.'
