  distractor_protocol: 'Create distractors based on:

    - Common misconceptions (e.g., confusing exfiltration with leakage).

    - Plausible alternatives (e.g., legitimate traffic patterns like high HTTPS POSTs).

    - Partial truths (e.g., symptoms of other phases).

    - Real-world edge cases (e.g., encrypted legitimate cloud sync vs. exfil). Ensure distractors are 70-80% plausible to
    challenge learners without frustrating.'

  **Pedagogical Guidelines**:

  - Align flashcards to these Bloom''s Taxonomy learning objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives array here].

  - Scaffold content across 4 layers: [INSERT scaffolding_layers array here].

  - Incorporate active learning: Reference discussion prompts, peer teaching, and problem-solving exercises where relevant.

  - Ensure completeness: Cover all techniques (HTTP/HTTPS with entropy/payload analysis, DNS tunneling, email, cloud storage/APIs,
  USB/physical, FTP/SCP) and detections; include phases, real-world examples (SolarWinds, Capital One).


  **Generation Instructions**:

  - Generate 25 high-quality MCQ flashcards balanced: 30% Layer 1-2 (remember/understand), 40% Layer 3 (apply/analyze), 30%
  Layer 4 (evaluate/create).

  - Follow exact flashcard schema: [INSERT flashcard_schema.structure here].

  - Use distractor protocol: [INSERT flashcard_schema.distractor_protocol here].

  - Output as numbered list in Markdown format for easy import (e.g., Anki). Make questions active and scenario-based where
  possible (e.g., ''In a PCAP, high subdomain entropy suggests...'').

  - Voter-approved focus: University pedagogy, web-grounded (e.g., sentinelone.com phases), no gaps in HTTP/HTTPS detection.'
