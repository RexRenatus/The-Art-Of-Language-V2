active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between strict AUP enforcement for security and allowing flexibility for productivity—use
    real-world examples like social media policies during remote work to spark critical thinking on ethics, compliance, and
    business impacts.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    for no rules); 4) Web research contrasts (e.g., varying sources on enforcement). Ensure distractors are realistic but
    incorrect.'

  **Core Content (Web-Grounded Research Summary, Completed per Best Practices)**:

  An AUP defines approved/prohibited uses of IT resources (networks, systems, data) as a code of conduct. Asset Security protects
  assets from unauthorized access/use. Importance/Benefits: Risk mitigation (breaches, malware), Legal compliance (HIPAA,
  GDPR, PCI DSS—avoids fines), User clarity/expectations, Productivity guidance, Incident response basis, Due diligence for
  audits. Key Components: Purpose, Scope, Rules (e.g., no personal email on corp systems, BYOD restrictions), Consequences
  (warnings to termination). Development Steps: 1) Assess assets/risks; 2) Draft with stakeholders/legal; 3) Review/approve;
  4) Train users; 5) Monitor/enforce. Best Practices: Clear language, annual reviews, integrate with DLP/SIEM. Sources: business.com,

  **Learning Objectives** (Align flashcards): [Insert the 6 objectives from above].

  **Active Learning Integration**: Weave in prompts evoking discussion (trade-offs), peer teaching (components), problem-solving
  (HIPAA scenarios).

  **Scaffolding**: Generate 10 flashcards per layer [Insert the 4 layers from above].


  **Generate Flashcards**: Output 40-50 in JSON array: [{''id'':1, ''type'':''MCQ|Q&A|cloze'', ''front'':''...'', ''back'':''...'',
