  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the potential consequences of sharing an unmarked presentation containing
    sensitive financial data in a public meeting. Consider impacts on compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and propose mitigation
    strategies using marking best practices from CISSP and ISO 27001.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in CISSP Asset Security. Generate\
  \ 25 high-quality Anki-style flashcards for the topic 'Presentation and Slide Marking' using the exact Topic Hierarchy:\
  \ Level1=Cybersecurity, Level2=Asset Security, Level3=Information and Asset Handling, Level4=Information and Asset Handling\
  \ Requirements, Level5=Labeling and Marking, Level6=Presentation and Slide Marking.\n\nIncorporate these pedagogical elements:\n\
  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]\n- Scaffolding Layers: [insert full scaffolding_layers JSON above]\n- Active\
  \ Learning: Draw from scenarios for applied questions.\n- Research Context: Use provided summary, completed with ISO 27001/27002\
  \ (A.5.12 classification/marking), NIST SC-10, best practices (banners/watermarks), tools (Office 365), sources with hyperlinks.\n\
  \nFlashcard Format (strict JSON array):\n[\n  {\n    \"question\": \"...\",\n    \"correct_answer\": {\"text\": \"...\"\
  , \"explanation\": \"...\"},\n    \"distractors\": [\n      {\"text\": \"...\", \"explanation\": \"...\"},\n      {\"text\"\

  \ per card (plausible, with explanations). Balance across Bloom's/objectives/layers. Questions test completeness (e.g.,\
  \ standards, best practices). University-level rigor; no hints in questions."
