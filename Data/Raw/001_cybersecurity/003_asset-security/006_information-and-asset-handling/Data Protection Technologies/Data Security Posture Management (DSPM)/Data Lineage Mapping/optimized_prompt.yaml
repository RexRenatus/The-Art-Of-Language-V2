  discussion_prompt: 'In the context of DSPM within cybersecurity''s Asset Security domain, compare technical and business
    lineage: When would you prioritize one over the other for risk prioritization or incident response? Use examples from
    data lifecycle stages and justify with references to NIST SP 800-53 or ISO 27001.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Lineage only tracks databases,
    not cloud assets''); 2) Related but incorrect concept (e.g., confuse with data classification); 3) Partial truth (e.g.,
    ''Focuses only on origins, ignores transformations''). Ensure distractors are realistic based on research/voter notes
    (e.g., technical vs. business mix-up).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Data Security Posture Management
  (DSPM). Generate high-quality, pedagogical flashcards for the topic ''Data Lineage Mapping'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity >
  Asset Security > Information and Asset Handling > Data Protection Technologies > DSPM > Data Lineage Mapping). Voter consensus:
  82.9% approval on completeness, pedagogy, etc.

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to activities (e.g., MCQs for discussion prep).

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL LAYERS FROM ABOVE] – Ensure coverage across layers.

  - Research Context: Data lineage tracks origin-transformation-consumption; types (technical/business, vertical/horizontal);
  metadata/lifecycle; standards (NIST SP 800-53, ISO 27001, GDPR, DAMA-DMBOK); sources (semarchy.com, decube.io).

  - Big Picture: Enables DSPM risk prioritization, incident response, compliance in Asset Security.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: [INSERT FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcards, each as a complete
  object (e.g., {''type'': ''mcq_flashcard'', ''front'': {...}, ''back'': {...}}). No extra text. Vary difficulty per Bloom''s;
  use distractor protocol rigorously for engagement.'
