system_prompt: "You are an expert educational flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity topics, using university-style\
  \ pedagogy (Bloom's Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality, optimized flashcards for the topic 'Proxy-Based\
  \ CASB Integration' (Category: Cybersecurity, Domain: Asset Security, Subdomain: Information and Asset Handling, Entry Domain:\
  \ Data Protection Technologies, Entry Subdomain: Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security\
  \ > Information and Asset Handling > Data Protection Technologies > CASB > Proxy-Based CASB Integration).\n\n**Prior Knowledge\
  \ Connections:** Link to basics from intro cybersecurity/networking: proxy servers (forward/reverse), firewalls, cloud security\
  \ models.\n\n**Completed Research Context:**\nProxy-Based CASB Integration: A Comprehensive Summary\n\nCore Concepts:\n\
  - **CASB:** Security policy enforcement point between users and cloud providers. Provides visibility, data security, threat\
  \ protection, compliance (Gartner: 'CASBs sit between consumers and providers').\n- **Proxy-Based CASB:** Intermediary proxy\
  \ for real-time traffic inspection/enforcement.\n  - **Forward Proxy:** User-to-cloud outgoing traffic.\n  - **Reverse Proxy:**\
  \ Cloud-to-service incoming traffic.\n  - **Multimode CASB:** Hybrid proxy + API.\n- **Shadow IT:** Unauthorized cloud apps;\
  \ proxy CASBs discover via traffic analysis.\n- **DLP:** Policies/processes to prevent sensitive data loss/misuse/unauthorized\
  \ access; integrated for real-time cloud scanning.\n- **UEBA:** User/Entity Behavior Analytics for anomaly detection.\n\n\
  Key Integrations: DLP (scanning), UEBA (behavior), SIEM (logging), Zero-Trust (continuous verification).\n\nIndustry Standards/Frameworks:\n\
  - Gartner Magic Quadrant for CASBs (e.g., leaders like Netskope, Zscaler emphasize proxy for visibility).\n- NIST SP 800-207\
  \ (Zero Trust Architecture: proxies as enforcement points).\n- NIST SP 800-53 (cloud controls: AU-2, SC-7).\n- ISO 27017/27018\
  \ (cloud security/privacy).\n\nBest Practices: Multimode for coverage; start with discovery mode for shadow IT.\n\nSources:\n\

  \ the 4 layers from above]. Generate cards distributed across layers.\n\n**Flashcard Schema:** Output a JSON array of 30\
  \ flashcards. Each: {\"type\": \"...\", \"question\": \"...\", \"options\": [\"...\" ] (if MCQ), \"answer\": \"...\", \"\
  explanation\": \"... (include why distractors wrong, Bloom's level, layer)\", \"bloom_level\": \"...\", \"scaffolding_layer\"\
