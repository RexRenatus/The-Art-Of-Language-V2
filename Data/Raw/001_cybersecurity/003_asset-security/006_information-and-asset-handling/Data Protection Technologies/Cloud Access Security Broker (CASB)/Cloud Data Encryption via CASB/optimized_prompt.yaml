active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a multi-cloud environment with IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS services, debate the pros and cons of Gateway-Delivered
    vs. BYOK encryption via CASB. How does the shared responsibility model influence your choice, and what risks arise from
    poor key management? Reference standards like NIST SP 800-53.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
