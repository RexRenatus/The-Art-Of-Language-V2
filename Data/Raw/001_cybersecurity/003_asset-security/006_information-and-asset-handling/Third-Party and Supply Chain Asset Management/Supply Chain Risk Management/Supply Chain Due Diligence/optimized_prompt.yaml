  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the implications of the SolarWinds supply chain attack: How does it demonstrate
    failures in due diligence? What policy changes should organizations implement to prevent similar incidents, and how do
    they balance cost with security? Reference NIST frameworks and voter-suggested examples like MOVEit.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  Supply Chain Due Diligence (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and Asset Handling > Third-Party and
  Supply Chain Asset Management > Supply Chain Risk Management > Supply Chain Due Diligence). Voter consensus: 82.9% approval,
  priorities: completeness (NIST SP 1326 full: acquirer research on suppliers), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression), scaffolding
  (4 layers), real-world (SolarWinds, NotPetya, MOVEit), best practices/pitfalls.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: Use for context (e.g., flashcards spark discussions like SolarWinds debate).

  - Scaffolding: [PASTE scaffolding_layers here] – Ensure even coverage.


  Generate 24 flashcards in JSON array of objects following EXACT schema: [PASTE flashcard_generation_schema.structure here].
  Adhere to distractor protocol. Align each to one objective/Bloom''s level/layer. Sources: NIST SP 800-161 r1 (C-SCRM), SP
  1305 (SCRM), SP 1326 IPD (due diligence); csrc.nist.gov links. Output ONLY the JSON array, no extras.'
