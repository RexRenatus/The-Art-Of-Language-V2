active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the risks of granting a third-party vendor permanent vs. JIT access to your organization's CRM
    system during a product integration. Propose mitigations (e.g., temporary credentials, external IDs) and debate in groups,
    citing real-world examples like the SolarWinds supply chain breach.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 1 based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse authorization with authentication).

    - 1 based on related but incorrect concepts (e.g., permanent vs. JIT access).

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Asset Security. Generate\
  \ 50 high-quality flashcards (20 Basic, 15 Cloze, 15 MCQ) on 'Third-Party Access Authorization' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity\
  \ > Asset Security > Information and Asset Handling > Third-Party and Supply Chain Asset Management > Third-Party Asset\
  \ Access > Third-Party Access Authorization).\n\n**Completed Research Context (Integrate Fully):**\nCore Concepts: Third-party\
  \ access authorization grants external entities (vendors, contractors) limited, temporary permissions to assets via least\
  \ privilege, JIT access (granted only when needed, auto-revoked), temporary credentials, external IDs (prevents confused\
  \ deputy in cross-account access).\nStandards/Frameworks:\n- NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5: AC family (AC-2 Account Management, AC-3\
  \ Access Enforcement, AC-6 Least Privilege, IA-5 Authenticator Management for JIT/temp creds); integrates with RMF (Categorize\
  \ assets, Select controls, Implement, Assess effectiveness, Authorize, Monitor for third-party risks).\n- ISO 27001: A.9.2\
  \ User Access Management (A.9.2.1-6 for third-party reviews).\n- CIS Controls v8: Control 5 Account Management, Control\
  \ 12 Data Protection.\n- Best Practices: Zero Trust (verify explicitly, assume breach), automated provisioning/revocation\
  \ (e.g., AWS IAM roles with external IDs), supply chain risk mgmt.\nRisks: Over-privileging (SolarWinds breach), credential\
  \ theft.\nSources: NIST SP 800-53 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final), RMF (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/37/r2/final),\
  \ ISO 27001 (https://www.iso.org/standard/27001).\n\n**Pedagogy Integration:**\n- Align to Bloom's objectives: [insert learning_objectives\
  \ array here].\n- Scaffolding: Distribute cards across layers [insert scaffolding_layers here] (Layer 1: 15 cards, Layer\
  \ 2: 15, Layer 3: 10, Layer 4: 10).\n- Active Learning Tie-Ins: Reference activities [insert active_learning here] in explanations\
  \ (e.g., 'Relates to discussion on permanent vs JIT risks').\n- Prior Knowledge: Assume basics like authn vs authz.\n\n\
