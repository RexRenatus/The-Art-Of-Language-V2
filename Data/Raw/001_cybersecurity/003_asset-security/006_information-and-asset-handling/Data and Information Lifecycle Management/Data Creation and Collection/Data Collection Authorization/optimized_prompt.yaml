  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste full learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: Use components for scenario inspiration and explanation tie-ins.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers: [Paste full scaffolding_layers here].

  - Prior Knowledge: Assume basics like PII and lifecycle; connect explicitly.

  - Research Context: Core concepts (PII, purpose limitation, data minimization); NIST Privacy Framework (Identify/Govern/Control/Communicate/Protect);
  NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (IP-1 Consent, PT-2 Authority to Process PII, etc.; https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final);
  GDPR Art. 6; CCPA; Sources: NIST PF (https://www.nist.gov/privacy-framework), NIST 800-53 (above), GDPR (https://gdpr.eu/),
  CCPA (https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa).

  - Misconceptions: ''Data collection authorization only for PII''; ''One-time process''; ''Ignores ethics beyond law'' –
  use for distractors.
