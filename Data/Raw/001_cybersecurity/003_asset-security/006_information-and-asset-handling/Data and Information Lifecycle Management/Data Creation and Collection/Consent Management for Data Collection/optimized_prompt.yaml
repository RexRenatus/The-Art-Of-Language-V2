    for valid consent under GDPR.'' Use examples from cookie banners and app permissions to support your arguments, referencing
    specific regulatory requirements.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (2) Partial truth from another regulation (e.g., CCPA opt-out), (3) Exaggeration/error (e.g., ''Pre-ticked boxes are valid
    if clear''). Ensure plausible for intermediate learners; avoid obvious wrongs.'

  Generate 80 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema. Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving to inspire scenario-based cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards evenly: 20% Layer 1 (definitions), 25% Layer 2 (frameworks), 30% Layer 3 (steps/examples),
  25% Layer 4 (integration).

  - Prior Knowledge: Assume basics in data lifecycle/privacy; cards should scaffold from there.

  - Content Completeness: Cover GDPR (Art 4(11),7: freely given/specific/informed/unambiguous), UK GDPR/ICO, CCPA/CPRA (opt-out/sale),
  ISO 27701. Best practices: granular UI, withdrawal, record-keeping, CMPs. Examples: cookie banners, apps. Big picture: Compliance/trust/breach
  prevention.

  - Bloom''s Coverage: Balance across levels.


  Research Context: [INSERT FULL RESEARCH SUMMARY + EXPANSIONS: Core concepts (consent attributes), roles (controller/subject),
  standards (GDPR, CCPA), best practices (inform/action/record/withdraw), sources (gdpr.eu, ico.org.uk, oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa)].


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards, each as: {"id":1, "layer":1, "bloom_level":"REMEMBER", "front":"Question text",
  "back":{"answer":"...","explanation":"...","distractors":["A","B","C"],"source":"..."}}.

  Ensure active recall, no hints on front, detailed backs for deep learning.'
