active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a scenario where a company faces a legal audit requiring immediate access to 5-year-old archived financial
    data containing CUI, discuss the potential security risks of expedited retrieval procedures and propose mitigation strategies
    drawing from NIST SP 800-53 MP controls (e.g., media transport MP-05, access control). What trade-offs exist between compliance
    speed and asset protection?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives: [insert learning_objectives array here].

  - Active learning: [insert active_learning object here].

  - Scaffolding: Prior Knowledge + 4 layers [insert scaffolding_layers here].

  - Ensure flashcards build progressively: 40% Layer 1-2 (foundation/components), 40% Layer 3 (implementation), 20% Layer
  4 (integration).

  - Key content: Definitions (archive retrieval, data remanence, CUI); NIST SP 800-88r1 (sanitization: Clear-overwrite, Purge-degauss/encrypt
  destroy, Destroy-incinerate/shred); NIST SP 800-53 (MP-05 transport, MP-06 sanitization); Step-by-step retrieval (authenticate,
  log, integrity check, secure transport, post-sanitization); Risks (remanence, unauthorized access); Sources: NIST SP 800-88r1,
  SP 800-53, SP 800-171r3.


  Follow this exact flashcard schema [insert flashcard_schema here]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 50 flashcards, each as {"front":
  "...", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "bloom_level": "...", "references": [...], "active_learning_link":
