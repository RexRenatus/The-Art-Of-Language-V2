active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether the benefits of data aggregation for analytics (e.g., improved business
    insights) outweigh the confidentiality risks (e.g., mosaic effect from combining customer purchase data with browsing
    history). Use NIST CSF Identify and Protect functions as evidence. What controls would you prioritize, and why?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., valid for single data but not aggregation); 3) Related but wrong concept (e.g.,
    mix with integrity vs. confidentiality risk). Ensure distractors test nuance (e.g., aggregation-specific vs. general data
    risks). Balance across CIA triad.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Data Aggregation Controls
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and Asset Handling > Data and Information Lifecycle Management
  > Data Processing and Usage > Data Aggregation Controls). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities,
  scaffolding layers (including prior knowledge and concept map), and flashcard schema to create optimized, university-level
  flashcards.


  Incorporate: Real-world examples (e.g., healthcare aggregation risks); aggregation-specific risks (mosaic effect, inference
  attacks); standards (NIST SP 1800-28 for confidentiality/asset protection; NIST CSF Identify/Protect; CIS Control 3 for
  data beyond enterprise). Ensure progression via scaffolding; tag by layer/Bloom''s.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each matching the schema: {front: {question: ''...'', options: [''A. ...'', ''B.
  ...'', ...]}, back: {correct_answer: ''A. ...'', explanation: ''...'', distractors: [{text: ''...'', why_wrong: ''...''}],
  tags: [...], related_activity: ''...''}}. Generate 50 flashcards balanced per schema rules. No additional text.'
