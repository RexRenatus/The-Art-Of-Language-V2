active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using data masking for agile development teams versus
    tokenization for high-compliance financial transactions. Support your position with references to reversibility, data
    utility, and real-world breach examples from sources like tonic.ai.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    attributes); 2) Based on voter-noted gaps (e.g., confuse reversibility); 3) Derived from research misconceptions (e.g.,
    ''Tokenization is always irreversible''); 4) Plausible for mid-level learners (avoid obvious errors). Ensure one distractor
    reflects a hybrid edge case.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Data Masking and Tokenization
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Asset Security > Information and Asset Handling > Data and Information Lifecycle Management
  > Data Processing and Usage > Data Masking and Tokenization).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full array from above]

  - Active Learning: Use for tie-ins in explanations.

  - Scaffolding: Base content on 4 layers [insert full scaffolding from above].


  Generate 50-100 high-quality flashcards following the exact schema:

  [insert full flashcard_schema from above]


  Ensure cards progress Bloom''s levels, use voter consensus (e.g., complete table features), web-grounded facts (tonic.ai,
  dualitytech.com), and prior knowledge links. Vary formats: cloze deletions, MCQs (with distractors), short-answer. Output
  ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects. No additional text.'
