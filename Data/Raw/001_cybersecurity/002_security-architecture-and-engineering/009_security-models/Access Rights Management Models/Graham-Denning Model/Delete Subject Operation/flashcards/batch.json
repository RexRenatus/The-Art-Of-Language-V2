        "core_logic": "The rule for securely deleting a subject in the Graham-Denning model is designed to maintain the system's security integrity. Its purpose is to ensure that all associated access rights and ownerships are completely and securely revoked. This prevents residual privileges that could be exploited for unauthorized access or privilege escalation, thereby ensuring that the subject's removal from the system is complete from a security perspective.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The first distractor focuses on resource management, not security. The second focuses on a symptom (login prevention) rather than the root cause (revocation of all rights). The third focuses on auditing, which is a separate concern.",
        "analogy": "The purpose of the rule for securely deleting a subject is like ensuring a former employee's access badges are deactivated and their company accounts are closed. The main aim is to prevent them from accessing sensitive areas or information they are no longer authorized to access."
