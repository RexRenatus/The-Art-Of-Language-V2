      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Chained delegation introduces complexity in maintaining security because trust and policy enforcement must be managed across multiple hops. As described in RFC 9115, this requires careful attention to contractual agreements and the consistent application of CSR templates at each stage of delegation to prevent unauthorized actions or privilege escalation. It functions by extending the security perimeter across interconnected entities.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly suggest implicit trust, elimination of security controls like CSR templates, or automatic privilege escalation, failing to recognize the need for rigorous, multi-level security management in chained delegation.",
        "analogy": "Chained delegation is like a relay race where each runner (entity) must securely pass the baton (capability/certificate) according to specific rules (contracts/templates) to the next runner, ensuring the baton isn't dropped or misused."
