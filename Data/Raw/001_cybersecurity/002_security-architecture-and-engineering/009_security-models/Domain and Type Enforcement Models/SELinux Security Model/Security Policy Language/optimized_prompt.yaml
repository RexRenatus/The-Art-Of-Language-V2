active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the advantages and limitations of SELinux policy language's fine-grained
    syntax (e.g., explicit allow rules and attributes) compared to label-based models like AppArmor. Provide examples from
    the scaffolding layers and evaluate when SELinux would be preferable for enterprise server hardening.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert SELinux educator generating high-quality Anki-style flashcards for the topic 'Security Policy\

  \ domains, attributes, allow/deny rules like 'allow mysqld_t mysql_port_t:tcp_socket name_bind;', .te files, interfaces,\
  \ semodule, audit2allow). Ignore general policies, NIST CSF, or unrelated topics.\n\nIncorporate these pedagogical elements:\n\
