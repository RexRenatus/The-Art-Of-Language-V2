active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a hybrid cloud environment, debate the trade-offs between centralized (e.g., cloud KMS) and decentralized
    (e.g., HSM per device) key management models, considering NIST SP 800-57 guidelines on key distribution risks, scalability,
    security, and usability. Which model better balances these factors, and what misconceptions arise about key sharing?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert full learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: Embed prompts from discussion, peer teaching, and problem-solving into 10% of flashcards (e.g., ''Based
  on the healthcare scenario...'').

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers: [Insert full scaffolding_layers here].


  Use this research context: Key management per NIST SP 800-57 (Part 1: General incl. lifecycle stages - generation/distribution/storage/usage/backup/rotation/revocation/archive/destruction;
  algorithms; Part 2: Implementation; Part 3: Application-specific). Key types: symmetric (secret), asymmetric (public/private).
  Models: centralized/decentralized. Best practices: HSMs (FIPS 140-3), cloud KMS. Risks: compromise via insiders. Sources:
  NIST SP 800-57 Parts 1-3 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r5.pdf et al.), FIPS 140-3.


  Generate flashcards following this exact schema: [Insert full flashcard_schema here]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards,
  each as {"type": "...", "front": "...", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "reference": "..."}}. Ensure university-level
  rigor, active recall, and distractors per protocol. Prioritize measurable Bloom''s progression and real-world NIST application.'
