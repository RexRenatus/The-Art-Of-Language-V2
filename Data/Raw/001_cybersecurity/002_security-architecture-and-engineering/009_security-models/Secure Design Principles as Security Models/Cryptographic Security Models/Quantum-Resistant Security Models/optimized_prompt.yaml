active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In a group debate, argue for or against the urgency of immediate PQC migration given current quantum
    computing limitations (address common misconception: ''quantum computers already break RSA today'' – clarify they require
    CRQC scale). Use evidence from NIST standards and ''Harvest Now, Decrypt Later'' threats to support positions.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 1. Common misconceptions (e.g., 'Quantum computers break RSA today' as distractor). 2. Partial truths
    (e.g., 'Grover's algorithm breaks PQC' – actually symmetric only). 3. Confusable terms (e.g., ML-KEM vs. ML-DSA). 4. Outdated
    info (pre-NIST standards). Ensure 1 best answer, distractors plausible but incorrect.
