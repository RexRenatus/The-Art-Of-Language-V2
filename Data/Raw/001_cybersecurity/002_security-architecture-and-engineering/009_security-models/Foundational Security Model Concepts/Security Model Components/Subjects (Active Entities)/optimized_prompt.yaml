active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In Zero Trust Architecture (per NIST SP 800-207), debate whether a microservice calling another service
    always makes the caller a subject or if it is context-dependent. Argue pros/cons using examples like workload-to-workload
    access, addressing misconceptions that subjects are only humans.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (4 options: 1 correct, 3 distractors), generate plausible distractors from common misconceptions:
    e.g., ''Subjects are only humans'' (vs. processes/devices); confuse with objects; outdated perimeter trust; ignore Zero

  **Research Context (Complete):** Subjects are active entities (users, processes, devices) requesting access to objects (passive
  resources) in access control. Core: Subject-Operation-Object model; Authentication (identity verification); Authorization
  (permission check). Standards: NIST SP 800-207 Zero Trust Architecture (continuous subject verification, no implicit trust):
  https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/207/final; NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) Identify/Protect: https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework;
  NIST SP 800-181 NICE Framework (workforce roles managing subjects): https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-181. Sources: Above
  + https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/subject.


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Align flashcards to Bloom''s: REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND (Layers 1-2), APPLY/ANALYZE (Layer 3), EVALUATE/CREATE
  (Layer 4). Incorporate prerequisites (OS processes, CIA triad). Big picture: Subjects enable robust access control, foundational
  to Zero Trust preventing breaches.


  **Scaffolding:** Generate 5-8 cards per layer:

  - Layer 1 Foundation: Basics/prereqs.

  - Layer 2 Components: Relationships/frameworks.

  - Layer 3 Implementation: Steps/tools.

  - Layer 4 Integration: ZTA/NIST/optimization.


  **Active Learning Tie-Ins:** Reference discussion (ZTA microservices), peer teaching (analogies), problem-solving (hospital
  RBAC) in explanations.


  **Output Exactly:** JSON array of 20-30 flashcards per schema. Ensure active recall, spaced repetition (concise fronts),
  voter consensus (completeness/pedagogy). No extra text.'
