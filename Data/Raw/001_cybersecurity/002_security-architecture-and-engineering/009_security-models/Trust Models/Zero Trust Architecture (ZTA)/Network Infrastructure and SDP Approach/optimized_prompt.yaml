active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss the common misconception that SDP is just a 'better VPN.' How does SDP's 'never trust, always
    verify' principle (from NIST SP 800-207) address modern threats like lateral movement in breached networks? Provide real-world
    examples from remote work or cloud migrations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    distractors are realistic based on voter-noted pitfalls like perimeter confusion.'
