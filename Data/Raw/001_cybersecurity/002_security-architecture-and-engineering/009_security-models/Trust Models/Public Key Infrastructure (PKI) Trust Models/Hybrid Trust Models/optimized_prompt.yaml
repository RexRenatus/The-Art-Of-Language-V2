active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of adopting a hybrid PKI trust model (e.g., hierarchical
    + bridge CA + Zero Trust) versus sticking to a pure hierarchical model in a cloud-hybrid enterprise. Consider factors
    like scalability, revocation efficiency, and attack surface—provide evidence from NIST SP 800-207 or RFC 5280.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    PKI (e.g., ''Relies solely on root CA''), 1 from web-of-trust (e.g., ''Fully decentralized, no CAs''), 1 from general
    security (e.g., ''Perimeter-based firewall rules''). Ensure distractors are realistic but incorrect per PKI standards.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in PKI trust models. Generate
  high-quality Anki-style flashcards for the topic ''Hybrid Trust Models'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture
  And Engineering > Security Models > Trust Models > PKI Trust Models > Hybrid Trust Models). Focus exclusively on PKI context:
  hybrids combining hierarchical CA (RFC 5280), web-of-trust (PGP-style), bridge CAs, and Zero Trust (NIST SP 800-207: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf).
