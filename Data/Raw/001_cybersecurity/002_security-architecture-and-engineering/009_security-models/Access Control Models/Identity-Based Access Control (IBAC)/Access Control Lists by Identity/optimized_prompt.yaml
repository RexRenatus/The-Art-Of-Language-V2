active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains and demonstrates (via diagram, pseudocode, or tool like icacls/chmod) how
    to implement an ACL for a shared file server. The listener quizzes the explainer and teaches back a variation, correcting
    any misconceptions (e.g., confusing ACLs with firewalls).
  problem_solving: Design ACLs for a hospital system scenario (e.g., patient records resource) ensuring HIPAA compliance.
    Identify and resolve least privilege violations, then role-play access requests to test the ACLs.

    attributes); 2) Partial truths (e.g., wrong permission like ''execute'' instead of ''read''); 3) Edge cases (e.g., group
    vs user identity mix-up, ignoring inheritance). Ensure distractors are plausible to educated learners but incorrect per
    NIST/DAC standards.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security Architecture and
  Engineering. Topic: ''Access Control Lists by Identity'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering
  > Security Models > Access Control Models > Identity-Based Access Control (IBAC) > Access Control Lists by Identity). Focus
  strictly on identity-based ACLs (explicit user/group permission lists in DAC, per voter accuracy notes), distinguishing
  from ABAC (dynamic attributes, NIST SP 800-162).

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the array above].

  - Scaffolding: [paste the array above]. Cover all layers progressively.

  - Active Learning: Inspire cards from discussions/problems (e.g., hospital HIPAA, cloud scalability).

  - Voter Consensus: Examples (NTFS, Cisco ACLs, Unix chmod), best practices (least privilege, audits), concept map links.


  Generate 25-30 high-quality flashcards per the schema: [paste schema above]. Ensure university pedagogy: Bloom''s progression,
  active recall, spaced repetition friendly. Use action verbs, real-world contexts. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcard
  objects, no extra text.'
