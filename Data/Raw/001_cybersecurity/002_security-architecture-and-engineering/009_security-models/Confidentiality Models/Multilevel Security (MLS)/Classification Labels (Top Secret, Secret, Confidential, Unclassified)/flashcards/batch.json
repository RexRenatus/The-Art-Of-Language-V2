      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Distinguishing between classified and CUI is vital because they are governed by different legal frameworks (e.g., E.O. 13526 for classified, E.O. 13556 for CUI) and have distinct protection mandates, since CUI is protected by statute, regulation, or policy, while classified information is protected by national security interest. This works by ensuring appropriate controls are applied based on the specific legal and sensitivity requirements.",
