      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Defense in Depth is a foundational concept that supports Zero Trust because Zero Trust requires continuous verification and granular access controls, which are best achieved by implementing multiple, independent security layers (Defense in Depth) to enforce policies at various points, since no single verification point is sufficient.",
