active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the effectiveness of DiD in cloud-native environments versus traditional
    on-premises networks. Consider multi-vector threats like phishing, insider risks, and zero-day exploits. Support arguments
    with real-world examples (e.g., Equifax breach) and propose hybrid DiD-ZTA integrations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on voter-noted misconceptions: 1) Single-layer defense
    (e.g., ''perimeter only''), 2) Over-simplification (e.g., ''eliminates all threats''), 3) Confusion with alternatives
    (e.g., ''same as Zero Trust''), 4) Partial truths (e.g., ''focuses only on technical controls''). Ensure distractors are
    realistic from research/common errors.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Defense in Depth (DiD)
  Strategy (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information System Lifecycle > Architecture
  and Design > Security Architecture Design > Defense in Depth Strategy). Use the provided scaffolding layers, learning objectives,
  active learning activities, and flashcard schema to generate high-quality, pedagogically optimized flashcards.


  Incorporate voter consensus: Complete layers with examples—Physical (locks/CCTV), Technical (firewalls, IDS/IPS, encryption,
  antivirus, MFA), Administrative (policies, training, risk assessments), Personnel (background checks, awareness). Integrate
  ZTA/NIST/ISO 27001. Base on research: DiD uses multi-overlapping controls for redundancy; complements ZTA.


  Structure output as a JSON array of flashcards, each matching the schema: {''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'',
  ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''distractors'': [...]}}. Cover all
  Bloom''s levels/objectives, 10 cards per scaffolding layer. Ensure active learning ties (e.g., reference hospital scenario).
  Use distractor protocol for misconceptions. Make explanations educational for spaced repetition/Anki compatibility.'
