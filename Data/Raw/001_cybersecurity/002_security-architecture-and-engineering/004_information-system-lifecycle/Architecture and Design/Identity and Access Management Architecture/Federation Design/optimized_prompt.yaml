active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a federated identity system for a cloud-based enterprise, debate the trade-offs between using a general-purpose
    Identity Provider (IdP) versus a subscriber-controlled wallet. Consider impacts on security, privacy, usability, and compliance
    with NIST SP 800-63C Federation Assurance Levels (FALs). Which would you recommend for a healthcare organization handling
    sensitive patient data, and why? Address misconceptions like assuming all federations are equally secure.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    user directly'' (ignores IdP role), 2) ''Federation eliminates trust agreements'' (ignores formal agreements), 3) ''All
    federations are equally secure'' (ignores FALs), 4) ''Subscriber wallets are always more private than general IdPs'' (trade-offs
    exist). Ensure distractors are realistic and educational.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Federation Design (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information System Lifecycle > Architecture and Design
  > Identity and Access Management Architecture > Federation Design). Use the following to create optimized Anki-style flashcards:


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives above].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Draw from discussion (IdP vs. wallet trade-offs), peer teaching (core concepts/FALs), problem-solving
  (university SSO) for scenario cards.


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers above]. Ensure cards progress from Layer 1 foundations to Layer 4 integration.


  **Research Context:** Federation enables single credentials across systems via IdP (authenticates/issues assertions), RP
  (verifies), CSP (proofing), Trust Agreements, Assertions, Federated Identifiers (per NIST SP 800-63C: https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63c.html).
  Concept map: Federation Design → IdP/RP/CSP; trust/assertion edges; FAL hierarchy.


  **Flashcard Schema:** [Insert schema above]. Output 40 flashcards in JSON array: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'',
  ''bloom_level'': ''Remember'', ''layer'': 1, ''type'': ''cloze''}].


  Prioritize university pedagogy: Bloom''s progression, active recall, spaced repetition. Use action verbs, measurable outcomes.
  Correct misconceptions in explanations. Ensure accuracy from NIST SP 800-63C.'
