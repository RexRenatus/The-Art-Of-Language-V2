active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a zero-trust enterprise security model, debate the trade-offs of prioritizing endpoint DLP agents
    versus network-based monitoring for data in motion. How does this impact compliance with regulations like GDPR? Support
    your arguments with real-world breach examples (e.g., Equifax).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    base on real pitfalls like false positives or deployment gaps.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Data Loss Prevention (DLP)\
  \ Architecture (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information System Lifecycle >\
  \ Architecture and Design > Data Security Architecture > DLP Architecture). Use the provided research context (core concepts:\
  \ DLP definition, data states, classification, policies; components: endpoint agents, network monitors, cloud modules, policy\
  \ engine, management console; deployment: network/endpoint/cloud; implementation steps/best practices; integrations: SIEM/IAM/CASB;\
  \ standards: CIS Control 13, ISO 27001, NIST; big picture: zero-trust/risk management. Prerequisites: access control, encryption,\
  \ basic classification), learning objectives, active learning ideas, and 4 scaffolding layers to generate 50 high-quality\
  \ flashcards.\n\nIncorporate university pedagogy: Progress from Layer 1 (Foundation) to Layer 4 (Integration); align to\
  \ Bloom's levels; promote active recall.\n\nOutput ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each matching this schema:\n{\n  \"\
