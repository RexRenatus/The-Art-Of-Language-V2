  ## Data Flow Mapping

  Data flow mapping visualizes data paths (in motion, at rest, in use) to identify vulnerabilities, enforce controls, and
  ensure compliance.


  Core Concepts: Data Flow (system-to-system paths); Data Flow Mapping (diagramming sources, destinations, protocols, controls);
  Security Architecture/Engineering (CIA protection across lifecycle).


  Standards:

  - NIST SP 800-53 Rev5: AC-4 Information Flow Enforcement (map flows for policy-based control); CM-8/CM-13 equivalents for
  inventory/mapping data flows.

  - NIS2 Directive (EU 2022/2555): Mandates supply chain/ICT data flow visibility.

  - Others: NIST 800-37 RMF, Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool (DFDs).
