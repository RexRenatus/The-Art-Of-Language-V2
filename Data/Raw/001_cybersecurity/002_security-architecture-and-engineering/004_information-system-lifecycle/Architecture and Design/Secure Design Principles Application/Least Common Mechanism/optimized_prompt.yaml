active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains the principle using a violation example (e.g., shared printer spooler creating
    covert channels); the partner provides a teach-back with a compliant non-example (e.g., containerized per-user sandboxes)
    and quizzes the explainer on misconceptions like confusing it with Least Privilege.
  problem_solving: Given a diagram of a monolithic application with shared components (e.g., global database cache), analyze
    potential information paths, identify violations, and redesign using microservices or zero-trust principles to minimize
    common mechanisms. Present redesign with pros/cons.

    - Confuse with Least Privilege (e.g., ''Minimize user privileges'' as distractor).

    - Overlap with Economy of Mechanism (e.g., ''Use simplest mechanisms'').

    - Real-world pitfalls (e.g., ''Shared mechanisms improve performance'' ignoring risks).

    - Partial truths (e.g., ''Only hardware mechanisms count'').

    Ensure distractors test nuance (e.g., from voter misconceptions like confusing principles).'
