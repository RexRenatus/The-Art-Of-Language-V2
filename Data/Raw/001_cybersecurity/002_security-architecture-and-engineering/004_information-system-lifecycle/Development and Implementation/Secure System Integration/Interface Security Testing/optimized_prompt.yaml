active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the OWASP WSTG-API testing methods for REST vs. GraphQL APIs. Using real-world examples like the
    Twitter API breach (excessive data exposure) or Equifax incident (injection flaws), classify vulnerabilities and propose
    mitigations. Which framework best addresses modern microservices threat models, and how should it evolve?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains a specific OWASP test (e.g., WSTG-API-02 Broken Object Level Authorization)
    using a diagram of an interface; the partner performs a teach-back by identifying it in a provided vulnerable code snippet
    (e.g., a REST endpoint missing object ID checks). Switch roles and discuss common misconceptions like confusing authorization
    with authentication.
  problem_solving: Given a sample vulnerable API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder with simulated BOLA flaw), students individually design
    3-5 test cases aligned with OWASP WSTG-API, then in small groups execute using tools like Postman or OWASP ZAP, collaboratively
    prioritize fixes, and apply to practical scenarios like secure system integration in cloud environments (e.g., AWS API
    Gateway).

  ## Interface Security Testing: Comprehensive Summary

  Interface security testing evaluates APIs/web services for vulnerabilities like unauthorized access/data breaches. Core
  Concepts: Interface (boundary for exchange), Testing (systematic vuln check), Vulns/Threats/Tests.

  OWASP WSTG-API (primary framework): -00 Overview, -01 Recon, -02 BOLA (manipulate IDs), -03 Broken Auth (weak schemes),
  -04 Function Auth, -05 Excessive Data, -06 Mass Assignment, -07 Misconfig, -08 Injection (incl. Input Validation: fuzz payloads,
  check sanitization), -09 Assets, -10 Logging.

  Input Validation Testing: Detect injection/mass assign. Steps: Identify inputs, fuzz (e.g., SQLi: '' OR 1=1), analyze responses,
  verify encoding.

  Sources: OWASP WSTG v4.2 (owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide), OWASP API Security Top 10, Tools: Postman/ZAP/Burp.

  Real-world: Twitter (data exposure), Equifax (injection).
