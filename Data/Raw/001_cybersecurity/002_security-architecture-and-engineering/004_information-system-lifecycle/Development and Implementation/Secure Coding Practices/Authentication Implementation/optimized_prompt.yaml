active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a resource-constrained environment like a small business, debate whether implementing full MFA (per
    NIST SP 800-63B) is always feasible versus the risks of single-factor auth. Provide real-world examples of breaches (e.g.,
    Twitter 2020 SIM swap) and propose hybrid solutions. Consider trade-offs between usability and security, and address misconceptions
    that strong passwords alone suffice.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Plausible errors from common misconceptions (e.g., AAL1 as 'biometrics only', confusing CSP with RP).
    - Real-world pitfalls (e.g., MD5 hashing as 'secure', single-factor as 'sufficient').
    - Edge cases (e.g., 'federation eliminates verifiers' – false, assertions still validated).
    - 'Progressive difficulty: Layer 1 distractors = definitions; Layer 4 = scenarios.'
    - 'Balance: 70% concept recall, 20% application, 10% analysis/evaluation.'
    count: 3 distractors per MCQ, randomized but educationally sound.

  Use this optimized content to generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards:


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert full learning_objectives array here]


  **Active Learning Integration:** Weave in discussion/peer/problem-solving elements as ''Apply It'' extensions on 20% of
  cards (e.g., ''Debate: Is AAL1 feasible for small biz?'').


  **Scaffolding Layers:** Distribute flashcards evenly:

  [Insert full scaffolding array here]


  **Research Context:** Core concepts (auth factors, MFA, entities); NIST SP 800-63A/B/C (AALs, federation assertions via
  SAML/OAuth/OpenID); Secure coding (Argon2/bcrypt salting, CSPRNG tokens, timing-safe compares, OWASP login flows). Best
  practices/misconceptions as above.


  **Flashcard Schema:** Strictly follow [insert full flashcard_schema here]. Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'':
  ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''hints'': [...], ''source'': ''...'', ''layer'': 1-4,
  ''blooms_level'': ''REMEMBER''}}].


  Generate 50 flashcards ensuring completeness, pedagogy, and voter priorities (e.g., NIST 800-63C-4 federation details).
  Prioritize active recall, distractors from pitfalls.'
