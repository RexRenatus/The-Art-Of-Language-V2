active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs between acquiring Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software versus developing
    custom solutions for a critical infrastructure system. Consider supply chain risks, compliance with ASF, and lifecycle
    costs. Which approach would you select for a scenario involving national security data, and why?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (2) Partial truth (e.g., ''COTS reduces all risks''), (3) Confusable term (e.g., NIST CSF function misapplied). Ensure
    distractors test nuance without being obvious.'
