active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Should emergency changes bypass full authorization? Argue pros/cons using NIST CM-3, citing real-world
    examples like Log4Shell or SolarWinds. Address the misconception that speed always trumps security.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    skip CM-3''). 2. Scope errors (e.g., ''Only production changes need auth''). 3. Incomplete controls (e.g., ''CM-4 only
    post-change''). 4. Real-world failures (e.g., ''SolarWinds succeeded despite auth''). Ensure distractors are 80% plausible,
    grounded in partial truths.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Change Authorization (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information System Lifecycle > Operations And Maintenance
  > Change Management > Change Authorization). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning components, scaffolding
  layers (4 progressive layers), and flashcard schema to generate high-quality, pedagogically optimized flashcards.


  Incorporate:

  - University-style pedagogy: Progress through Bloom''s (Remember to Create).

  - Voter consensus: NIST CM-3/4/5 details, misconceptions, prior knowledge (SDLC/ITIL/Git), big picture (SolarWinds/Log4Shell
  prevention).

  - Research: NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 (CM-3: Config Change Control; CM-4: Impact Analyses; CM-5: Access Restrictions), baseline
  configs, etc.

  - Sources: NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf), NIST SP 800-128
  Guide to Enterprise Patch Management.

  explanation, distractors if MCQ, active_tie_in), ''scaffolding_layer'', ''category'' (e.g., Foundation, NIST Controls)]}.
  Ensure 40-50 cards, balanced by Bloom''s/scaffolding. No extra text.'
