active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the implications of using independent CIA levels (trigraph, e.g., M-M-H)
    in CNSSI 1253 versus the high-water mark in FIPS 200 for NSS. How does this affect risk management in national security
    contexts? Provide examples from real-world systems like intelligence databases.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs: 1) Common misconception (e.g., ''Uses high-water mark like
    FIPS 200''); 2) Related but incorrect term (e.g., ''CIA triad only''); 3) Partial truth (e.g., ''Moderate for all CIA
    levels''). Ensure distractors test subtle differences (e.g., NSS vs. non-NSS, baselines vs. overlays).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  CNSSI 1253 Application for National Security Systems (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering >
  Information System Lifecycle > Initiation and Concept Phase > Security Categorization > CNSSI 1253 Application for National
  Security Systems). Use the provided scaffolding, learning objectives, active learning ideas, and research context to generate
  high-quality Anki-style flashcards.


  **Content Foundation:** Integrate voter consensus: Independent CIA trigraph (e.g., M-M-H), differs from FIPS 199/200 high-water
  mark; CNSSI 1253 tailors NIST SP 800-53 baselines (Low/Mod/High with NSS parameters, e.g., stricter IA-2 values), overlays,
  full RMF integration, privacy controls. Sources: CNSSI 1253, NIST SP 800-53/59, RMF.org, learn.microsoft.com.


  **Pedagogy:** Align flashcards to Bloom''s objectives (1 Remember, 1-2 Understand, 1-2 Apply/Analyze, 1-2 Evaluate/Create).
  Scaffold across 4 layers. Inspire active learning (e.g., flashcards prompting categorization exercises).


  **Output Format:** JSON array of flashcards, each matching the schema: {''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'',
  ''explanation'': ''...'', ''references'': ''...'' }, ''metadata'': {...}}. Follow distractor protocol strictly. Generate
  25 flashcards balanced by layer/Bloom''s. Ensure university-level rigor, no fluff.'
