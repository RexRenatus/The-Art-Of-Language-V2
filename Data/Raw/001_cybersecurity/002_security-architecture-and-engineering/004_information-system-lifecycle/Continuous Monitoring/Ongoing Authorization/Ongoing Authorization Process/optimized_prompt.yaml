active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of cloud-native environments and zero trust architectures, discuss how Ongoing Authorization
    (OA) addresses limitations of static authorization models. Provide examples of compliance benefits (e.g., FedRAMP, CMMC)
    and potential challenges in implementation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Generate\
  \ high-quality, optimized flashcards for the topic 'Ongoing Authorization Process' using the EXACT topic_hierarchy: Cybersecurity\
  \ > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information System Lifecycle > Continuous Monitoring > Ongoing Authorization\
  \ > Ongoing Authorization Process.\n\nIncorporate these pedagogical elements:\n- Learning Objectives: [REMEMBER: Define\
  \ key terms such as Ongoing Authorization (OA), Authorizing Official (AO), and Information Security Continuous Monitoring\
  \ (ISCM). UNDERSTAND: Explain the integration of OA within the NIST RMF steps... (full list as provided)]\n- Scaffolding\
