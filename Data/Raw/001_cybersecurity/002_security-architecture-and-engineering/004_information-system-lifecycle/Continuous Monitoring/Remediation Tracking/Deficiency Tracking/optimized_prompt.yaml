active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between manual deficiency tracking (e.g., Excel spreadsheets)
    and automated tools (e.g., Jira or ServiceNow). Consider factors like scalability, accuracy, cost, and compliance with
    NIST CA-5. Provide evidence from real-world federal agency examples and propose a hybrid approach.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions: 1) Semantic confusion (e.g., mix
    up deficiency vs. vulnerability); 2) Partial truth (e.g., correct element but wrong context); 3) Extreme/oversimplified
    (e.g., ignore milestones). Ensure distractors are realistic from voter suggestions/web context (e.g., outdated manual
    methods). Balance coverage: 40% REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND, 30% APPLY/ANALYZE, 30% EVALUATE/CREATE.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Deficiency Tracking (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information System Lifecycle > Continuous Monitoring
  > Remediation Tracking > Deficiency Tracking). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities, 4-layer
  scaffolding, and flashcard schema to create 50 high-quality Anki-style flashcards.


  **Content Sources:** Integrate definitions (deficiency, vulnerability, remediation, POA&M), NIST SP 800-53 Rev5 CA-5 (POA&M
  for tracking weaknesses from assessments/monitoring; best practices: ensure accuracy/currency/availability via automation),
  RA-5 (vulnerability scanning), RMF integration, tools (Jira, ServiceNow), examples (sample POA&M entries), concept map.
  Complete best practices: Quarterly updates, risk prioritization, FISMA compliance.


  **Pedagogy:** Align flashcards to Bloom''s levels (progress from REMEMBER to CREATE). Incorporate active learning hints.
  Scaffold from Layer 1 (foundations) to Layer 4 (integration).


  **Output Format:** JSON array of objects, each: {''front'': ''Question text'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'': ''...'', ''active_learning_hint'': ''...''}}, following schema
  exactly. Ensure distractors are plausible. Cover all objectives and layers comprehensively. No duplicates; optimize for
  spaced repetition and active recall.'
