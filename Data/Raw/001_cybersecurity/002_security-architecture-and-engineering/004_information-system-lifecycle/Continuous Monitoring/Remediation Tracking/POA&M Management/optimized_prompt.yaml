active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between aggressive remediation timelines in a POA&M versus
    risk acceptance for legacy systems. How does this impact FISMA reporting and Authorization to Operate (ATO)? Support your
    position with references to NIST SP 800-53 and real-world examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Plausible but incorrect: Based on common misconceptions (e.g., milestones not SMART, confusing remediation with acceptance).'
    - 'From research: Use near-misses from definitions (e.g., ''POA&M is only for vulnerabilities'' vs. weaknesses/findings).'
    - 'Balanced difficulty: 1 easy (obvious wrong), 1 medium (partial truth), 1 hard (subtle mix-up).'
    - 'Avoid randomness: Tie to voter priorities (e.g., incomplete NIST integration).'

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use concepts from discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving to inspire analytical cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers: [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM ABOVE].

  - Voter Consensus (100% approval): Ensure completeness (NIST SP 800-53 integration: POA&Ms track weaknesses from control
  assessments; NIST 800-137 for monitoring; full sources: security.cms.gov/learn/plan-action-and-milestones-poam, security.cms.gov/policy-guidance/cms-plan-action-and-milestones-poam-handbook);
  pedagogy (Bloom''s progression, prior knowledge: NIST 800-30 risk assessment); scaffolding reorg; big picture (FISMA/ATO);
  lifecycle steps; POA&M example; RCA.

  - Research Context: POA&M as corrective plan with SMART milestones; weaknesses from NIST 800-53; remediation vs. acceptance;
  RCA for root causes. Sources: security.cms.gov (all linked pages).


  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards following the exact schema:

  [INSERT FULL FLASHCARD_SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''front'': {...}, ''back'': {...}}, ...]. Ensure university-level pedagogy: active
  recall, spaced repetition friendly, distractors per protocol. Cover all objectives/layers evenly, include 1-2 cards per
  active learning concept, real-world examples, and truncated content completions (e.g., NIST 800-53: ''Weaknesses identified
  during assessments are entered into POA&Ms for tracking to closure''). No extra text.'
