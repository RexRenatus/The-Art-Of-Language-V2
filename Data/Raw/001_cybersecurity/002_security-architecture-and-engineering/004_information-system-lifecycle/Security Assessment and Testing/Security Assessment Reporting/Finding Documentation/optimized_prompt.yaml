active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a time-sensitive security incident, how do effective documentation finding strategies (e.g., NIST
    CSRC searches) versus ad-hoc web searches impact reporting accuracy and response time? Debate pros/cons with examples
    from NIST CSF or SP 800-53A.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    \ Govern).\n2. Partial truth (e.g., correct source but wrong doc).\n3. Unrelated/common error (e.g., ISO 27001 instead\
    \ of NIST). Base on real errors like confusing ZTA with VPNs or perimeter models."
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for university-level cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom's\
  \ Taxonomy, active learning, and scaffolding. Topic: 'Finding Documentation' (Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And\
  \ Engineering > Information System Lifecycle > Security Assessment and Testing > Security Assessment Reporting > Finding\
  \ Documentation).\n\n**Context**: Focus on strategies for finding documentation (search tips, NIST CSRC, operators) for\
  \ security assessment reporting (vulnerability desc, risk ratings, evidence, remediation). Key sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (Core:\
  \ Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover; Tiers/Profiles), NIST SP 800-207 (Zero Trust: Policy Engine, no implicit\
  \ trust), SP 800-53A (RMF assessments). Voter priorities: Search procedures, lifecycle links, completeness (e.g., reporting\
  \ best practices), concept map integration.\n\n**Pedagogy Integration**:\n- Learning Objectives: [Insert full list from\
  \ above].\n- Active Learning: Incorporate prompts/exercises into scenario cards.\n- Scaffolding: [Insert full 4 layers from\
  \ above]. Distribute cards: 6-8 per layer.\n\n**Research Context** (completed): NIST CSF 2.0 provides flexible risk mgmt\
  \ across Functions; SP 800-207 details ZTA implementation; SP 800-53A guides assessment reporting with controls/evidence.\n\
  \n**Output**: JSON array of 25-30 flashcards strictly following the schema:\n{\n  'flashcards': [\n    {\n      'front':\
  \ '...',\n      'back': {\n        'answer': '...',\n        'explanation': '...',\n        'bloom_level': '...',\n    \

  \ variety, no repetition, high-quality distractors, measurable objectives alignment."
