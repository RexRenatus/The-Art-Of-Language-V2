active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group, debate whether annual contingency training is sufficient under CP-3 or if it should be triggered
    by every major system change or incident. Support arguments with NIST SP 800-53 CP-3 rationale, real-world examples like
    the SolarWinds hack, and references to SP 800-34 for contingency planning.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Plausible misconceptions: e.g., Confuse CP-3 frequency with CP-4 testing (annual vs. 3 years); mix with IR training;
      wrong triggers (e.g., ''only post-incident'' vs. periodic).'
    - '3 distractors per MCQ: 1 similar control (CP-4), 1 opposite/extreme (daily training), 1 unrelated (planning only).'
    - 'Base on real errors: From NIST discussions, e.g., overlooking role-based tailoring or update requirements.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST SP 800-53 controls.
  Generate 40 high-quality flashcards on ''Contingency Training (CP-3)'' in the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security
  Architecture And Engineering > Information System Lifecycle > Incident Response and Recovery > Contingency Planning (CP
  Family) > Contingency Training (CP-3).


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Cover via scenario cards (e.g., ransomware debate/exercise).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards: 10 Layer 1, 10 Layer 2, 10 Layer 3, 10 Layer 4.

  - Schema: Use exact structure/types/distractors as defined.


  Ensure cards promote active recall, spaced repetition: Varied formats, progressive difficulty (Bloom''s order), misconceptions
  addressed. Base content on NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 CP-3 (role-based training every 3 years/min, updates on plan changes),
  SP 800-34, CSF 2.0. Include prior knowledge links.


  Output ONLY a JSON array: [{''front'': ''Question here'', ''back'': ''Answer + Explanation + Distractor rationale if MCQ'',
  ''bloom_level'': ''REMEMBER'', ''layer'': ''1'', ''type'': ''MCQ''}]. No extra text.'
