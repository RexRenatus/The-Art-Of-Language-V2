These methods often leave data recoverable. True media sanitization requires using a full disk wiping program that overwrites the entire storage area multiple times or employing a drive's secure erase function, ensuring that all previous data is irrecoverably removed before the media is reused or disposed of.",

        "analogy": "Ensuring media is sanitized before disposal is like making sure a secret message is completely burned before discarding the paper. Simply crumpling the paper isn't enough; you need to ensure every trace of the message is destroyed so it can't be pieced back together."

        "core_logic": "NIST IR 8387 clarifies that in digital forensics, a 'digital image' refers to an exact, bit-for-bit copy of an entire storage medium (like a hard drive or USB stick). This is often called a 'forensic image.' It captures not just the visible files but also unallocated space, deleted files, and file system metadata, providing a complete snapshot of the data at a specific point in time. This 'gold standard' of copying is crucial for thorough analysis.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Each distractor uses a common or partial understanding of 'image' or 'copy' that does not align with the forensic definition of a bit-for-bit copy.",
        "analogy": "Creating a digital image is like making a perfect photocopy of an entire document, including any notes in the margins, crossed-out words, or even blank pages where something might have been erased. It's a complete replica, not just a summary or a picture of the original."
