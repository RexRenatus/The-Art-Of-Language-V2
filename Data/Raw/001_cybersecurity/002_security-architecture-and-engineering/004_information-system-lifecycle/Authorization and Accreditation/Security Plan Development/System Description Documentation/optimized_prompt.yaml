  **Core Content**: Use this completed research context:

  System description documentation details system characteristics, security/privacy requirements, architecture, controls (per
  NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5), and context. Developed/maintained via SDLC. Defines authorization boundary for RMF (NIST SP 800-37
  Rev 2: 7-step process integrating security/privacy: Prepare, Categorize, Select, Implement, Assess, Authorize, Monitor).

  NIST PL-2: Develop/document/disseminate SSP describing system, controls, responsibilities.
