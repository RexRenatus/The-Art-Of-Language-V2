active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the effectiveness of prioritizing 'Protect' over 'Detect' functions in
    NIST CSF for a high-velocity threat environment like ransomware attacks. Use real-world examples (e.g., SolarWinds breach)
    and voter-suggested metrics like residual risk to support arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs: Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse Detect with
    Respond; mix up residual vs. inherent risk; outdated CSF 1.1 functions). Ensure distractors are realistic (e.g., from
    ISO vs. NIST differences) but clearly wrong per authoritative sources.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  Risk Mitigation Strategy Effectiveness (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information System
  Lifecycle > Authorization and Accreditation > Risk Determination > Risk Mitigation Strategy Effectiveness). Consensus: 68.6%
  approval from 7 voters emphasizing NIST CSF 2.0 completeness, Bloom''s objectives, 4-layer scaffolding, sources, concept
  map, prior knowledge.


  **Completed Research Context:** Risk Mitigation: Reduce risk likelihood/impact via strategies (avoid, transfer, mitigate,
  accept). Effectiveness: Measured by residual risk reduction (inherent risk minus control effectiveness), incident probability
  decrease, posture improvement. Frameworks: NIST CSF 2.0 (Govern: GV.OV, GV.RM; Identify: ID.RA; Protect: PR.AA, PR.AT; Detect:
  DE.AE, DE.CM; Respond: RS.RP, RS.MI; Recover: RC.RP, RC.IM); NIST RMF SP 800-37 (Prepare, Categorize, Select, Implement,
  Assess, Authorize, Monitor); NIST SP 800-53 controls; ISO/IEC 27001 (Annex A controls), 27005 (risk treatment). Metrics:
  Residual risk calc, control testing (pen testing, audits), continuous monitoring. Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/cybersecurity-framework-20);
  SP 800-37r2 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/37/r2/final); SP 800-53r5 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final);
  ISO 27001:2022, 27005:2018.
