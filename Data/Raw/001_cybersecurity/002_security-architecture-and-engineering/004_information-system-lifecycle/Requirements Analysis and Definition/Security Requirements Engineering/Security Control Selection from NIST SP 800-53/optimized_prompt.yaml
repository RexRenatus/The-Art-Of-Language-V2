active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Given a scenario of a federal agency migrating to cloud services, debate and prioritize 5-7 security
    controls from NIST SP 800-53 families like SC (System and Communications Protection), SA (System and Services Acquisition),
    and SI (System and Information Integrity). Justify choices based on risk assessment (SP 800-30) and trade-offs between
    cost, usability, and security. Address misconceptions like one-size-fits-all controls.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Related but incorrect family/control (e.g., CM instead of SC), 3) Partial truth (e.g., ''Low baseline only'' vs. ''tailored
    Low''). Ensure distractors teach by elimination. Base on real NIST variations or breaches.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in NIST SP 800-53 Security
  Control Selection. Use university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy (objectives provided), active learning (discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving
  prompts), 4-layer scaffolding (with prior knowledge and big picture), progressive complexity.


  **Topic Context:** Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information System Lifecycle > Requirements Analysis
  and Definition > Security Requirements Engineering > Security Control Selection from NIST SP 800-53. Role: RMF Step 2.


  **Incorporate Exactly:**

  - Learning objectives (span Remember to Create).

  - Active learning links per card.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers.

  - Cover all 20 families, RMF steps, baselines (800-53B), tailoring/overlays, SSP.

  - Research: NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 (20 families), 800-37 RMF, 800-60 categorize, 800-30 risk, 800-137 monitoring, OSCAL, cross-maps
  (CIS/ISO).


  **Generate 50 flashcards following schema:**

  - Front: Question (MCQ/Cloze/Short answer).

  - Back: {answer, explanation (pedagogical rationale, misconceptions), references, active_learning_link, scaffolding_layer}.

  - Distractors: 3 plausible per MCQ (misconceptions, related errors, partial truths).

  - Balance: Layers, Bloom''s, families. Ensure measurable, active recall.


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of 50 flashcards.'
