active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a high-stakes cybersecurity project, how might incomplete traceability in an RTM lead to vulnerabilities?
    Debate the trade-offs between comprehensive tracing and development speed, considering real-world impacts like regulatory
    compliance and risk mitigation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs: Generate 3 plausible distractors based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse RTM columns:
    ''Source'' as ''Test Result'' instead of origin; mix SRTM with general RTM by omitting security derivation; reverse forward/backward
    traceability). Ensure distractors are realistic from research context (e.g., HHS guide errors) but incorrect per standards.'
