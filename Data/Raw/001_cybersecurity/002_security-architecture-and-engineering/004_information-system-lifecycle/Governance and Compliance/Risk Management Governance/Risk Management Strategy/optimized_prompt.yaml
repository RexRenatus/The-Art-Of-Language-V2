active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between achieving full NIST CSF Tier 4 (Adaptive) risk management
    versus maintaining Tier 2 (Risk Informed) for a resource-constrained small business. Support arguments with real-world
    examples from sources like NIST case studies and consider impacts on risk tolerance.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Use this comprehensive content:


  Core Concepts: Cybersecurity Risk (potential loss from threat exploitation), Risk Management (identify/assess/respond),
  Risk Tolerance (acceptable risk level), Cybersecurity Risk Management Strategy (plan aligning with objectives/ERM), ERM
  (holistic risk mgmt per COSO).


  Frameworks (complete): NIST CSF 2.0 Govern (GV) function: 6 categories - GV.OC Organizational Context, GV.RM Risk Management
  Strategy, GV.RR Roles/Responsibilities, GV.PO Policy, GV.OV Oversight, GV.RS Resources. Tiers: 1 Partial (ad hoc), 2 Risk
  Informed (prioritized), 3 Repeatable (defined processes), 4 Adaptive (innovative/proactive). ISO 27001: Clause 6.1 risk
  assessment/treatment. CIS Controls v8: Safeguard 1-20 prioritized. Others: NIST SP 800-30, 800-53; COSO ERM.


  Implementation: Steps - Identify (assets/threats), Assess (likelihood/impact), Prioritize, Respond (4Ts: Terminate/Tolerate/Treat/Transfer),
  Monitor/Review.


  Integration: Align with ERM, lifecycle stages, compliance (GDPR, HIPAA).


  Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (nist.gov), ISO/IEC 27001:2022, CIS Controls v8 (cisecurity.org), NIST SP 800-30/53, COSO ERM 2017,
  (ISC)² CBK.


  Prerequisites: Basic risk from Governance/Compliance.
