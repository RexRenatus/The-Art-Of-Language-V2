active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether organizations should mandate TLS 1.3 exclusively or allow TLS 1.2 for
    legacy compatibility. Consider security risks (e.g., vulnerabilities in TLS 1.2), performance, cost, and RFC 9325 recommendations.
    Support your position with evidence from real-world examples like HTTPS or VPN deployments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs: 1 common misconception (e.g., ''TLS 1.0 is secure''), 1 outdated practice
      (e.g., ''SSLv3''), 1 edge case (e.g., ''DTLS for TCP'').'
    - Base on real vulnerabilities (e.g., Heartbleed, POODLE), RFC 9325 prohibitions, or voter/research context.
    - Ensure 1 correct answer is unambiguous; distractors 70% plausible to skilled learners, 30% obvious errors.
    - 'Avoid randomness: Tie to topic hierarchy (e.g., confuse transit with at-rest protection).'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:\
  \ Data in Transit Protection (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Secure Design Principles\
  \ > Data Protection Design > Data State Protection > Data in Transit Protection). Use provided research context (RFC 9325:\
  \ Mandate TLS 1.2+, prefer 1.3; prohibit legacy; DTLS for datagrams; threats like MITM; complete session resumption, cert\
  \ validation), voter consensus (100% approval: pedagogy via Bloom's, 4-layer scaffolding, active learning), and best practices\
  \ (Anki-optimized: spaced repetition, active recall).\n\nLearning Objectives: [INSERT ARRAY FROM ABOVE].\nScaffolding Layers:\
  \ [INSERT SCAFFOLDING FROM ABOVE].\nActive Learning: Incorporate concepts from activities into flashcards (e.g., debate\
