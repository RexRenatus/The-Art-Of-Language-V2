active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of NIST SP 800-53 SA-8(5), debate whether hardware-based mechanisms (e.g., CPU privilege
    rings for memory access) are always preferable to software-based ones for efficiently mediated access. Consider trade-offs
    in performance, cost, security assurance, and flexibility. Provide examples (e.g., hardware reference monitors in secure
    enclaves) and counterexamples (e.g., software bottlenecks in virtualized environments).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    mediation'' (ignores efficiency); 2) Over-favor software/hardware without trade-offs; 3) Ignore stakeholder constraints
    (e.g., assume universal hardware preference). Ensure distractors are realistic, stem from research/voter insights, and
    teach via explanation.'

  Topic: Efficiently Mediated Access (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Secure Design Principles
  > Security Architecture Principles > Access Control Architecture > Efficiently Mediated Access). Voter consensus: 100% approval
  on completeness (complete NIST SA-8(5), AC-25, sources), pedagogy (Bloom''s objectives, active learning, 4-layer scaffolding).


  Core Content: Efficiently mediated access (NIST SP 800-53 Rev5 SA-8(5)) uses least common mechanism for policy enforcement
  on resources (CPU, memory, etc.), aligning with stakeholder requirements/constraints. Prefer efficient hardware where possible;
  distinguish from complete mediation. Sources: NIST SP 800-53 Rev5 (SA-8(5), AC-25), secure design best practices.
