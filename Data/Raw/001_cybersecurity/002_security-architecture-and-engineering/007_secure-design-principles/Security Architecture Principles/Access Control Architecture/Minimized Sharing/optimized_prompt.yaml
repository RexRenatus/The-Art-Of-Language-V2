active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of Zero Trust Architecture (NIST SP 800-207), debate the trade-offs between minimized
    sharing and operational efficiency in a cloud-native microservices environment. Consider real-world impacts like reduced
    lateral movement in breaches (e.g., SolarWinds) versus potential performance overhead.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    errors: Overstate efficiency trade-offs. 3. Partial truths: Mix with related concepts like ''need-to-know'' but invert.
    4. Real-world distractors: Reference incorrect breach outcomes.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Minimized Sharing'' (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Secure Design Principles > Security Architecture Principles
  > Access Control Architecture > Minimized Sharing). Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities, 4-layer
  scaffolding, and flashcard schema to create optimized Anki-compatible flashcards.


  Incorporate:

  - University pedagogy: Cover all Bloom''s levels progressively.

  - Voter consensus: Include NIST CSF PR.AA-05, Zero Trust (NIST SP 800-207), real-world examples (SolarWinds, Equifax), steps
  for implementation, trade-offs.

  - Research context: Least privilege, data minimization, attack surface reduction, lateral movement prevention.

  - Active learning: Weave in discussion/peer/problem-solving elements into explanations.

  - Scaffolding: Ensure even distribution across layers.


  Generate exactly 48 flashcards following the schema. Output as JSON array of objects, each with fields: front, back, type,
  bloom_level, scaffolding_layer, distractors (array or null), explanation, source. Make questions challenging yet scaffolded;
  explanations foster deep understanding and link to objectives/activities.'
