  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active Learning: Use for higher-order cards (e.g., scenarios from discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving).

  - Scaffolding Layers: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE] – Distribute flashcards: 25% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 25%
  Layer 4.

  - Research Context: Tamper-proof design ensures integrity against physical/logical tampering; key standards: NIST SP 800-160
  (lifecycle engineering), SP 800-53 PE-5(5) (tamper-proofing), SR-3 (supply chain: limit sources, verify, audit to prevent
  tampered components). Reference Monitor: Tamper-resistant mediator for access controls.
