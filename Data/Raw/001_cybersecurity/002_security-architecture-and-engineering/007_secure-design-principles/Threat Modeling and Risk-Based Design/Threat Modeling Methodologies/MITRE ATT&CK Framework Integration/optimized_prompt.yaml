active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In small groups, debate how MITRE ATT&CK enhances or challenges traditional threat modeling methods like
    STRIDE or DREAD. Provide examples of tactics where ATT&CK offers more actionable insights, and discuss potential integration
    pitfalls (e.g., over-reliance on techniques without context).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy\
  \ (Bloom's Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards for the topic 'MITRE ATT&CK Framework\
