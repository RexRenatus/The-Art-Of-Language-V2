active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a scenario where a private key is compromised, debate the timeliness of CRL issuance versus the risks
    of delayed revocation. What factors (e.g., network load, security urgency, CA policies) influence CRL or Delta CRL frequency?
    Reference real-world examples like the DigiNotar breach.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs based on voter-identified misconceptions: (1) Confusing
    CRL with full certificate invalidation or re-issuance; (2) Mixing Delta CRL role (updates only) with full CRL; (3) OCSP
    as batch vs. real-time; (4) Ignoring standards like RFC 5280; (5) Overlooking trade-offs (timeliness vs. load); Ensure
    distractors are realistic (e.g., ''OCSP lists all revocations like CRL'' instead of absurd options).'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for university-level Cybersecurity education, specializing in Security\

  \nIncorporate these elements:\n- Learning Objectives: [REMEMBER: Define key revocation and list CRL components], [UNDERSTAND:\
  \ Explain Delta CRLs], [APPLY: Check certificate vs CRL], [ANALYZE: Compare CRL/Delta/OCSP], [EVALUATE: Critique timeliness],\
  \ [CREATE: Design revocation procedure].\n- Scaffolding: Layer 1 (Foundation: definitions like CRL, Delta CRL, reasons),\
  \ Layer 2 (Components: RFC 5280, X.509, CRL structure), Layer 3 (Implementation: revocation/checking steps, best practices),\
  \ Layer 4 (Integration: OCSP, DigiNotar example, hybrid PKI).\n- Active Learning Context: Link to PKI prerequisites; use\
  \ real-world (DigiNotar); misconceptions for distractors.\n- Research: CRL (signed serial list), Delta CRL (deltas since\
  \ base), OCSP (online queries), RFC 5280 (X.509 CRL profiles), revocation reasons.\n\nGenerate 25-30 high-quality flashcards\
  \ optimized for Anki/Spaced Repetition: 40% basic/cloze, 60% MCQ. Balance: 5-8 per layer, span all Bloom's levels (prioritize\
