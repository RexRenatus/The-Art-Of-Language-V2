active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: To what extent does reducing system complexity conflict with implementing comprehensive security controls
    like Zero Trust? Debate using examples from breaches such as SolarWinds (supply chain complexity) or Log4j (dependency
    sprawl), where complexity amplified vulnerabilities. Address the misconception that simplicity compromises security.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQ (60% of cards): 4 options (1 correct, 3 distractors). Distractors must be plausible based
    on common misconceptions: 1) Partial truths (e.g., ''Reduces attack surface but increases privilege''), 2) Confusions
    with related concepts (e.g., mix with ''defense in depth''), 3) Real-world inversions (e.g., cite SolarWinds as pro-complexity).
    Ensure distractors teach by highlighting errors.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education. Generate 25-35 high-quality,
  spaced-repetition-optimized flashcards on ''Reduced Complexity'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture
  And Engineering > Secure Design Principles > Foundational Security Design Principles > Complexity Management > Reduced Complexity).


  **Incorporate these pedagogical elements:**

  - Target the exact learning objectives: [paste learning_objectives array]. Distribute cards evenly across Bloom''s levels.

  - Draw content from scaffolding layers: [paste full scaffolding object]. Ensure coverage of all layers.

  - Embed active learning hooks: Reference discussion prompts, peer activities, and problem-solving in explanations.

  - Use research context: Core concepts (Complexity, Reduced Complexity, Attack Surface, Least Privilege, Assume Breach);
  Frameworks (NIST CSF 2.0, NIST SP 800-207 ZTA); Examples (SolarWinds, Log4j); Sources as listed.

  - Prior knowledge: Link to Attack Surface and Least Privilege.


  **Output Format:** JSON array of objects, each: {"front": "Question text", "back": "Answer text", "type": "MCQ|Q&A|Cloze",
  "bloom_level": "REMEMBER|etc.", "scaffolding_layer": "1|2|3|4", "explanation": "Detailed explanation with references, distractor
  rationale if MCQ."}. For MCQ front: ''Q: ... A) opt1 B) opt2 C) opt3 D) correct''. Follow flashcard_schema strictly: atomic
  facts, active recall, 60% MCQ with distractor protocol.


  Generate now, ensuring completeness, no redundancy, and university-level rigor.'
