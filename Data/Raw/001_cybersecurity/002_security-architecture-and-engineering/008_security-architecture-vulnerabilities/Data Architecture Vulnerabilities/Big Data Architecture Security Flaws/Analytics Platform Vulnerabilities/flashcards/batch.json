        "core_logic": "MFA significantly enhances security because it requires more than one piece of evidence to verify a user's identity, making it much harder for attackers to gain access even if one factor is compromised. Analytics platforms, handling sensitive data, benefit greatly from this layered security, functioning through diverse authentication methods.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors misrepresent MFA by suggesting it speeds up logins, eliminates password complexity, or performs encryption, all of which are incorrect and fail to capture its primary security benefit.",
        "analogy": "Multi-factor authentication for an analytics platform is like needing both a key card and a fingerprint to enter a secure area; it adds layers of security beyond just having one credential."

An accurate inventory allows for effective vulnerability management and security monitoring, functioning through continuous asset tracking.",

        "analogy": "Maintaining a system component inventory for an analytics platform is like keeping an up-to-date roster of all personnel and assets in a secure facility; it's essential for knowing who and what is present at all times."

        "core_logic": "Unauthorized connections are a major security risk because they bypass established security controls, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or malware introduction. Analytics platforms must therefore implement robust boundary protection and monitoring, functioning through firewalls and intrusion detection systems.",
