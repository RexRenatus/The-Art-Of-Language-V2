  **Core Concepts (Completed from NIST/AWS):** Resource portals are ZTNA gateways for resource access. Flaws: Auth weaknesses
  (e.g., no continuous verification), data exposure, insecure controls, infrastructure vulns, poor auditing. NIST SP 800-53
  Rev. 5: AC-6 Least Privilege, IA-2/5 Auth, AU-2/12 Auditing, SC-8 Transmission Confidentiality. NIST SP 800-207 Zero Trust,
  800-63-4 Digital Identity. Examples: Okta 2022 breach (session hijacking via auth bypass). Best practices: Micro-segmentation,
  MFA+, logging.


  **Sources:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf), NIST SP

  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the learning_objectives array above].

  - Active Learning: Embed prompts in explanations (e.g., ''Discuss as in peer teaching'').

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards: 30% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 25% Layer 3, 20% Layer 4. Use [Layer:X] tags.

  - Concept Map: Reference in explanations (e.g., ''Auth flaws link to NIST IA family'').


  Follow flashcard_generation_schema exactly. Output as JSON array of flashcards, each with ''front'', ''back'' (nested as
  specified), ''bloom_level'', ''layer'', ''tags''. Ensure distractors follow protocol. Prioritize voter consensus: completeness
  (NIST full, examples), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression).'
