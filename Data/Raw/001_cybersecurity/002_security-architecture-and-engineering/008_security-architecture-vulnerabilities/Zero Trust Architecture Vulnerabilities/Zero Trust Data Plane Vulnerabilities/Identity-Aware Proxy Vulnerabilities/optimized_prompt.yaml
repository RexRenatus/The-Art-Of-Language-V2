  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''IAP eliminates the need for network firewalls in Zero
    Trust architectures.'' Use examples of IAP vulnerabilities like insecure application logic or signed header misuse to
    support your position, referencing real-world misconfigurations (e.g., hypothetical breaches from permissive IAM roles
    leading to unauthorized Compute Engine access).'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    IP for auth'' vs. identity), 2) Partial truths (e.g., ''Validate client headers'' vs. ''signed IAP headers''), 3) Related
    but wrong concepts (e.g., VPN perimeters vs. Zero Trust identity), 4) Edge cases (e.g., service accounts confused with
    user principals). Ensure distractors are realistic from voter/research context (e.g., firewall misconfigs, unvalidated
    headers).'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)\
  \ Vulnerabilities within Zero Trust Architecture (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering\
  \ > Security Architecture Vulnerabilities > Zero Trust Architecture Vulnerabilities > Zero Trust Data Plane Vulnerabilities\
  \ > Identity-Aware Proxy Vulnerabilities).\n\nGenerate 50 high-quality flashcards (balanced across 4 scaffolding layers,\
  \ spanning all 6 Bloom's objectives) using university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition, higher-order thinking.\n\
  \nIncorporate:\n- Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST HERE]\n- Scaffolding: [PASTE FULL LAYERS HERE] (10-15 cards per\
  \ layer, progressing foundation to integration; complete 'Insecure Application Logic' with header validation details).\n\
  - Active Learning: Weave in prompts (e.g., 'Apply to scenario X for problem-solving').\n- Voter Consensus: 87.1% approval;\
  \ emphasize misconfigs, real-world examples, IAM/Zero Trust prereqs.\n- Research: IAP proxies HTTPS, auth via Google, signed\
  \ headers for apps; vulns in unvalidated headers, Context-Aware bypasses, service accounts.\n\nOutput ONLY valid JSON array\
