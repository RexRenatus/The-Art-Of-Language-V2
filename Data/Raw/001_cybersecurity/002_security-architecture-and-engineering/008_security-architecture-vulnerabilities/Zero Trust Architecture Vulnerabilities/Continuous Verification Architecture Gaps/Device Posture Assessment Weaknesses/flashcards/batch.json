If device posture assessment can only determine if a device is 'compliant' or 'non-compliant' overall, but cannot differentiate access based on specific applications or services running on that device (e.g., allowing access to a secure browser but blocking access to a file-sharing app), it violates Least Privilege by potentially granting overly broad access.",

Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are not directly compromised by a lack of granular control over application access.
