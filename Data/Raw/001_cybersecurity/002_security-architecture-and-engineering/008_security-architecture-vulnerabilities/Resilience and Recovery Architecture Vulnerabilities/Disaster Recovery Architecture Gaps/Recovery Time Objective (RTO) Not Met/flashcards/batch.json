      "distractors": [
        {
          "text": "The customer portal's code is not well-commented.",
          "misconception": "Targets [code quality vs. infrastructure]: Code comments aid maintainability but don't directly impact the speed of infrastructure recovery."
        },
        {
          "text": "The use of deprecated security protocols.",
          "misconception": "Targets [security protocol vs. performance]: Deprecated protocols are a security risk, but the RTO miss points to a performance/resource issue in recovery."
        },
        {
          "text": "The incident response team's communication plan is unclear.",
          "misconception": "Targets [procedural vs. architectural gap]: While communication is important, the RTO miss implies a technical inability to restore the service quickly, not just poor coordination."
        }
      ],
      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Because RTO is about recovery *time*, a consistent failure to meet it during tests suggests the recovery environment itself is undersized or lacks adequate resources (compute, network), preventing optimal performance and thus exceeding the RTO.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors focus on code quality, security protocols (which are security, not speed, issues), or communication, which are less likely direct causes of exceeding the RTO than resource limitations in the recovery environment.",
        "analogy": "Missing an RTO for a portal recovery is like trying to run a marathon with inadequate training resources – the problem isn't the runner's technique (code comments) or the race rules (protocols), but the lack of necessary resources (compute/bandwidth) to finish on time."
