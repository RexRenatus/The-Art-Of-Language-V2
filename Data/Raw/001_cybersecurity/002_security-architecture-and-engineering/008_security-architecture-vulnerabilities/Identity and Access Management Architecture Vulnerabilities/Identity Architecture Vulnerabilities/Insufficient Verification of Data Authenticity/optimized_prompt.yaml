active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether relying solely on cryptographic signatures (to address CWE-347) is sufficient
    to mitigate CWE-345 (Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity), or if origin validation (CWE-346) and comprehensive
    NIST SP 800-63 guidelines on federation assertions are always necessary. Support arguments with real-world examples like
    the SolarWinds supply chain attack or OAuth misconfigurations.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    by explaining why wrong in ''explanation'' field. Base on real pitfalls from NIST/CWE/OWASP.'
