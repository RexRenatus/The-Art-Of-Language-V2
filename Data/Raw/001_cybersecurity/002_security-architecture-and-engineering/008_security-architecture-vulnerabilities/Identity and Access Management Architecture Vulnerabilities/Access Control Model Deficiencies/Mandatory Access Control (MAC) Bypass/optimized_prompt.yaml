active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the real-world implications of a successful MAC bypass in high-security
    environments (e.g., government or military systems using SELinux). Consider trade-offs between MAC strictness and usability,
    and propose how understanding bypasses like TOCTOU races improves defensive strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., confuse MAC with DAC override).

    - Distractor 2: Partial truth/mix-up (e.g., valid for DAC but not MAC).

    - Distractor 3: Extreme/unrelated error (e.g., irrelevant to bypass technique).

    Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter-noted techniques (e.g., mislabel TOCTOU as buffer overflow) and research
    context. Mark correct option in explanation.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² CISSP domains. Topic:
  ''Mandatory Access Control (MAC) Bypass'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Security Architecture
  Vulnerabilities > Identity and Access Management Architecture Vulnerabilities > Access Control Model Deficiencies > Mandatory
  Access Control (MAC) Bypass). Approval: 55.7% (enhance completeness per voters).


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the ''learning_objectives'' array here].

  - Active Learning: Use concepts from [discussion_prompt], [peer_teaching_activity], [problem_solving_exercise] for scenario-based
  cards.

  - Scaffolding: [paste full ''scaffolding'' object here]. Ensure cards progress layers.


  Knowledge Base (complete per voters/research):

  - MAC: Central authority enforces label-based access (no user overrides). Key: Labels, policy, kernel enforcement.

  - Vs. DAC (owner sets perms), RBAC (roles).

  - Bypass Techniques (full list): 1. Buffer overflows (kernel code corruption, e.g., CVE-2020-14386 SELinux). 2. TOCTOU races
  (timing gaps in label checks). 3. Misconfigurations (SELinux policy errors, AppArmor profile flaws). 4. Symlink attacks
  (label following). 5. Kernel exploits/privilege escalation (e.g., CVE-2019-10207).

  - Mitigations: ASLR/PAC for overflows, atomic ops/locks for TOCTOU, auditd/selinux-relabel for misconfigs, noexec mounts.

  - Sources: searchinform.com (MAC defs), jit.io (enforcement), blog.invgate.com (DAC), SELinux docs (redhat.com), AppArmor
  (ubuntu.com), NIST SP 800-53.
