      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Organizational structures and job roles are dynamic. When access control policies are not regularly reviewed and updated to reflect these changes, users may retain privileges they no longer need (privilege creep) or lose access to resources they now require. This leads to outdated access controls that do not align with current job functions, increasing security risks by granting excessive permissions or hindering legitimate operations. Therefore, periodic policy reviews are essential for maintaining an effective and secure access control posture.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors suggest policies become too simple (opposite), update automatically (false), or reviews are too costly (false economy), failing to address the core security risks of privilege creep and outdated controls.",
        "analogy": "It's like having a security badge system where old employee badges are never deactivated, and new employees don't get the correct access – the system doesn't reflect the current reality."
