  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the statement: ''In high-pressure environments, granting administrators full, permanent access
    is more practical than enforcing strict PoLP.'' Use examples from real breaches (e.g., SolarWinds) to argue for or against,
    addressing misconceptions like ''privileges can always be revoked later.'''
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
