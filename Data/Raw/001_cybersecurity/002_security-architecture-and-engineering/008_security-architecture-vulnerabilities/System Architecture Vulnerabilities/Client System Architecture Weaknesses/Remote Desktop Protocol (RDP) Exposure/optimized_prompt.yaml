active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of exposing RDP directly to the internet versus tunneling
    it through VPN or RD Gateway. Use real-world examples from sources like Berkeley Security or eSecurity Planet to support
    your arguments, and evaluate which approach best balances usability and security (prompts ANALYZE and EVALUATE).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    vs. 80/443/22), partial truths (e.g., ''NLA alone prevents MITM'' – false, needs TLS), or edge cases (e.g., ''RDP only
    uses TCP'' – ignores UDP). Ensure distractors teach via explanation. No obvious wrongs.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) Exposure (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Security Architecture
  Vulnerabilities > System Architecture Vulnerabilities > Client System Architecture Weaknesses > Remote Desktop Protocol
  (RDP) Exposure). Use this enhanced research context (complete with voter consensus additions):


  **Core Concepts:** RDP (Microsoft protocol for remote GUI access, TCP 3389, client-server). Exposure risks: internet-facing
  increases attack surface. Attacks: Brute-force (credential guessing), MITM (intercept via weak encryption pre-TLS), vulnerabilities
  (e.g., BlueKeep CVE-2019-0708). **Microsoft Best Practices (completed):** Enable NLA (auth before session), TLS 1.2+, MFA
  (Azure AD/Duo), RD Gateway (brokered access), restrict port 3389 (firewall/VPN only), change port, logging/monitoring (Event
  ID 4625), least privilege. Sources: CovertSwarm, eSecurityPlanet, Berkeley Security, NIST SP 800-53.

  layers [insert full list above]. Generate flashcards per schema [insert full schema above]. Ensure completeness: Cover mitigations
  with steps, links to networking/auth basics, higher Bloom''s emphasis. Output ONLY a JSON array of 40-50 flashcards matching
  the exact schema. No extra text.'
