active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a Zero Trust Architecture, debate the trade-offs between full observability via distributed tracing
    and data privacy risks. Using a hypothetical scenario where PII leaks through tracestate headers during a production incident
    (e.g., customer SSNs in vendor-specific fields), argue for or against mandatory redaction—support with evidence from W3C
    specs and real-world breaches like the 2023 tracing exfiltration case in a major cloud provider.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MC: 1) Semantic inversion (e.g., swap risks/benefits), 2) Common misconception
    (e.g., ''traceparent carries PII by default''), 3) Partial truth (e.g., correct for tracestate but wrong for traceparent).
    Ensure plausible for cybersecurity learners; avoid obvious errors.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on
  ''Distributed Tracing Data Exposure'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Security
  Architecture Vulnerabilities > Security Monitoring and Logging Architecture Vulnerabilities > Application Performance Monitoring
  Security Gaps > Distributed Tracing Data Exposure).


  **Incorporate these pedagogical elements:**

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the full array from ''learning_objectives'']

  - Active Learning: Use scenarios from [reference active_learning and real_world_scenarios] for applied cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across Prior Knowledge, Layers 1-4, Big Picture, Sources.

  - Research Context: [paste full ''scaffolding'' content including completions: tracestate fully described as ''vendor-specific
  list of key-value pairs for additional trace context, max 512 chars''; mitigations complete; big_picture; sources].


  **Output Format:** JSON array of objects, each: {''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''blooms_level'': ''...'', ''distractors_used'': ''[array for MC]'', ''source'': ''...''}}. Follow Flashcard Schema exactly.
  Vary types (40% MC, 30% Q&A, 30% Cloze). Ensure measurable, active recall. Distractors per protocol. Cover all Bloom''s
  levels and layers progressively.'
