  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on voter-noted misconceptions (e.g., confusing fog
    decentralization with cloud centralization; overemphasizing latency without security trade-offs; mixing edge/fog roles).
    Ensure distractors are 70% correct-sounding but flawed (e.g., ''Fog reduces attack surface like cloud'' as distractor
    for increased surface fact). Vary difficulty: 1 easy (obvious wrong), 1 medium (partial truth), 1 hard (common error).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university pedagogy (Bloom''s
  Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality Anki-style flashcards for ''Fog Computing Architecture Weaknesses''
  (Category: Cybersecurity; Domain: Security Architecture And Engineering; Subdomain: Security Architecture Vulnerabilities;
  Entry: Infrastructure/Edge Computing Vulnerabilities; Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering >
  ... > Fog Computing Architecture Weaknesses).


  **Consensus Voter Inputs (100% approval):** Ensure completeness: Cover truncated ''Proximity to Edge Devices'' (physical
  tampering: unauthorized access, hardware compromise, supply chain risks); add limited resources (DoS vulnerability), mobility
  (dynamic auth), trust management (heterogeneous verification), scalability (policy enforcement). Include IoT/Cloud comparisons,
  mitigations (zero-trust, blockchain), sources (e.g., [1] Yi et al., IEEE Fog Survey 2015; [2] MDPI Fog Security Review 2022).


  **Full Synthesized Topic Content:**

  Fog Computing: Decentralized paradigm extending cloud to network edge for low-latency IoT. Fog Nodes: Intermediate devices
  (routers to servers). Edge Devices: Data sources (sensors). Vs. Cloud: Distributed > larger attack surface; vs. Edge: More
  compute than pure edge.

  Weaknesses/Risks:

  1. Distributed/Heterogeneous: Inconsistent policies, config drift → attack surface expansion.

  2. Proximity to Edge: Physical tampering (edge proximity enables theft/modification), untrusted data ingress.

  3. Limited Resources: Constrained nodes → DoS, side-channels.

  4. Mobility: Dynamic topology → ephemeral trust failures.

  5. Trust Mgmt: Node heterogeneity → insider threats, spoofing.

  6. Scalability: Growth → mgmt overload.

  Mitigations: Zero-trust perimeters, blockchain ledgers, AI anomaly detection.


  **Incorporate Elements:**

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the 6 objectives above].

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste the 4 layers above] – Generate cards per layer.

  - Active Learning: Inspire cards with discussion/problem-solving hooks (e.g., ''Scenario for peer teaching'').


  **Output 30 flashcards in JSON array:** [{''type'': ''basic|mcq'', ''layer'':1-4, ''bloom_level'':''...'', ''front'': ''...'',
  ''back'': {... as per schema}}]. Follow flashcard_schema exactly: Varied types, distractors protocol, rich explanations.
  Ensure pedagogical progression, no criminal content.'
