active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between HVAC connectivity for energy efficiency in smart buildings versus the cybersecurity
    risks it introduces. Consider real-world implications like physical safety risks from manipulated controls and reference
    the 2013 Target breach.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For multiple-choice questions (20% of cards): Generate 3 plausible distractors. Base on common misconceptions
    (e.g., confuse OT with IT; mix up BAS with SCADA; use similar threats like ''phishing'' instead of ''ransomware''). Ensure
    distractors are realistic from research context but incorrect. Mark correct answer clearly.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in HVAC System Control Exposure
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Security Architecture Vulnerabilities > Infrastructure
  Architecture Vulnerabilities > Physical Infrastructure Security Architecture Gaps > HVAC System Control Exposure).


  Incorporate this research context: HVAC systems in BAS are OT/CPS vulnerable to ransomware (e.g., Target 2013 breach via
  HVAC vendor), unauthorized access, DDoS, physical risks. Mitigate per NIST SP 800-82 Rev. 3 (OT security guide: risk assessment,
  segmentation, controls) and NIST Cybersecurity Framework.
