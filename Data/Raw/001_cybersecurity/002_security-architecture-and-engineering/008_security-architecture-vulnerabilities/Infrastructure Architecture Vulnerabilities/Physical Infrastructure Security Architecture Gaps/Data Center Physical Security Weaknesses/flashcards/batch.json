      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Information leakage from electromagnetic emanations is a physical security concern addressed by the Physical and Environmental Protection (PE) family, specifically PE-19, because these controls aim to protect systems from unintended release of data via signals.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly associate the weakness with data transmission, configuration management, or audit logging, missing the physical emanations aspect covered by PE controls.",
        "analogy": "It's like a radio transmitter leaking sensitive information that can be picked up by an unauthorized receiver."
