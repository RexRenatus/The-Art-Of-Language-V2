      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Allowing configuration changes without formal review, approval, or documentation is a critical CM-3 misconfiguration because it bypasses essential checks and balances, since modifications are not vetted. This works by enabling unauthorized or poorly planned changes to be implemented, potentially introducing vulnerabilities, instability, or security weaknesses without oversight.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors focus on automation, baseline management, or impact analysis, failing to identify the core misconfiguration: the absence of a formal change control process that mandates review, approval, and documentation.",
        "analogy": "Allowing anyone to modify the structural plans of a building without any architect's review or engineer's approval; changes could be made that compromise the building's integrity or safety."
