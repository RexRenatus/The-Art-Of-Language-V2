active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between performance overhead and security benefits of encrypting
    east-west traffic in a high-scale microservices environment. Use real-world examples from cloud-native deployments and
    reference NIST CSF guidelines to support your arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
