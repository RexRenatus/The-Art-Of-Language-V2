active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between performance and security in Kubernetes runtime environments.
    How do ephemeral pods exacerbate gaps like lateral movement, and what zero-trust principles could address them? Support
    your arguments with real-world examples from breaches like those involving container escapes.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol:
  - 'Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., ''Runtime security only scans images'' instead of behavioral monitoring).'
  - 'Distractor 2: Related but incorrect concept (e.g., ''hostNetwork mount'' for privilege escalation instead of capabilities).'
  - 'Distractor 3: Partial truth exaggerated (e.g., ''Static scans prevent lateral movement'' ignoring runtime dynamics).'
  - Ensure distractors are plausible for cybersecurity learners; avoid obvious wrongs. Balance across Bloom's levels.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Container Runtime Security
  Gaps (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Security Architecture Vulnerabilities > Application
  Architecture Vulnerabilities > Container Architecture Vulnerabilities > Container Runtime Security Gaps). Use the provided
  research context: Runtime security protects running containers/pods/nodes via monitoring/behavioral analysis; Kubernetes
  challenges include container escape (sandbox breakout), privilege escalation (via misconfigs like hostPath/service accounts),
  lateral movement, ephemeral environments complicating monitoring (sources: activestate.com/blog/kubernetes-runtime-security).

  - Active Learning: [insert summaries of discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving]

  - Scaffolding: [insert 4 layers]


  Generate flashcards following this exact schema: JSON array of objects, each with ''front'' (question), ''back'' {answer,
  explanation, bloom_level, references[]}, ''distractors'' [3 items], ''metadata'' {scaffolding_layer, active_learning_link,
  difficulty}.


  Distractor protocol: [insert protocol]. Ensure questions scaffold progressively, link to objectives/activities, use real-world
  Kubernetes examples. Cover gaps like escapes, escalations, movement. No voter suggestions (consensus not reached). Output
  ONLY the JSON array of 50 flashcards.'
