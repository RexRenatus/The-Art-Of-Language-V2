active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the real-world consequences of CWE-924 using examples like the WhatsApp
    Web QR code spoofing vulnerability or TLS protocol downgrade attacks. How does improper message integrity enforcement
    enable identity spoofing, and what compliance implications does it have under NIST or OWASP frameworks?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate distractors that: 1) Reflect frequent errors (e.g., ''Integrity only needs hashing without
    keys'' for HMAC questions); 2) Use similar CWE IDs or mechanisms (e.g., CWE-327 instead of 924); 3) Mimic secure vs. improper
    (e.g., ''TLS 1.0 suffices''); 4) Are realistic from voter/research context. Ensure 1 correct, 3 distractors per MCQ.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on ''Improper Enforcement of Message
  Integrity'' (CWE-924) in the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Security Architecture
  Vulnerabilities > Cryptographic Architecture Vulnerabilities > Cryptographic Signature and Validation Flaws > Improper Enforcement
  of Message Integrity.
