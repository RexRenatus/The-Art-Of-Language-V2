      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The public key-transport key's cryptoperiod defines when it can be used to encrypt keying material; if this period expires, the associated private key may no longer be able to decrypt that material if it's needed later, because the binding or trust may have lapsed; therefore, its use is time-bound to ensure subsequent decryption is possible.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The first distractor incorrectly suggests computational infeasibility. The second confuses the public key's role in transport with key generation. The third conflates expiration with compromise.",
        "analogy": "Using an expired shipping label (public key) to send a package (encrypted key) means the recipient might not be able to retrieve it later if their access method (private key) is tied to the label's validity period."
