active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether the Clark-Wilson model's implementation flaws (e.g., TP certification
    complexity and IVP scalability) make it obsolete for modern dynamic environments like cloud-based financial systems, using
    real-world examples or hypotheticals to support your position.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (4 options: 1 correct, 3 distractors): Generate plausible distractors from common misconceptions
    (e.g., confuse CDI with UDI; mix TP with IVP roles; underestimate scalability flaws by citing successes). Ensure distractors
    are realistic based on research (e.g., ''RBAC fully replaces SoD'' as wrong). Label why each distractor is incorrect in
    explanation.'

  Generate 40 high-quality flashcards (10 per scaffolding layer) optimized for Anki/Quizlet, spanning all Bloom''s levels
  via these objectives: [INSERT learning_objectives ARRAY HERE]. Incorporate voter priorities: completeness on flaws (TP/IVP
  certification challenges, IVP scalability, SoD enforcement overhead/dynamic env issues, UDI errors, auditing, RBAC/ABAC
  integration, financial real-world failures/non-successes); pedagogy via Bloom''s progression and 4-layer scaffolding: [INSERT
  scaffolding ARRAY HERE].


  Use web-grounded context: CDIs (validated data), UDIs (input to validate), TPs (certified transforms), IVPs (state checks),
  triples (user-TP-CDI), well-formed transactions, SoD. Key flaws: TP cert complexity/scale, IVP overhead in large systems,
  SoD dynamic enforcement gaps, UDI validation failures, audit burdens, modern integration issues.


  Integrate active learning hooks: Reference discussion (e.g., scalability debates), peer teaching (flaw examples), problem-solving
  (scenarios).


  Strictly follow flashcard_schema: [INSERT flashcard_schema HERE]. Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards, each as {"front":
  "...", "back": {"answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "bloom_level": "...", "scaffolding_layer": #, "related_objectives":
  [1,3], "sources": "..."}}. Balance: 40% MCQ with distractors, 30% definitions, 30% scenarios/open. Ensure progressive difficulty,
  no repetition, educational depth.'
