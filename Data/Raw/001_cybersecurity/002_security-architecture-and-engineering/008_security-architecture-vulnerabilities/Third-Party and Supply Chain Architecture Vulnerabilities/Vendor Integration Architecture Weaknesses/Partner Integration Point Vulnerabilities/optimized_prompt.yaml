active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains partner integration vulnerabilities (e.g., insecure APIs) while the other
    quizzes on corresponding controls; switch roles and discuss misconceptions.
  problem_solving: Analyze a mock vendor API integration scenario (e.g., B2B OAuth flow with misconfigurations) and propose
    step-by-step mitigations using NIST supplier assessment processes.

  Incorporate this comprehensive content:

  - **Foundation**: Definitions (integration points: APIs, protocols; vulns: insecure APIs, auth issues, OAuth misconfigs,
  shadow IT). SCRM, SDLC, RMF basics.

  - **Components**: Standards - NIST SP 800-161 Rev. 1 (C-SCRM, SR-7 monitoring), NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (SR controls), NIST
  SP 800-37 Rev. 2 (RMF), OWASP API Security Top 10.

  - **Implementation**: Supplier assessment steps, best practices (contracts, monitoring).

  - **Integration**: Zero Trust, CISSP Domain 3, examples (SolarWinds supply chain, Kaseya breach).

  - **Why It Matters**: Prevents attacks; prerequisites: APIs/SDLC/risk mgmt.

  - **Sources**: NIST SP 800-161r1 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-161r1.pdf), NIST SP
  800-53r5 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf), OWASP API Top 10 (https://owasp.org/API-Security/),
  SolarWinds report (https://www.solarwinds.com/solarwinds-results).
