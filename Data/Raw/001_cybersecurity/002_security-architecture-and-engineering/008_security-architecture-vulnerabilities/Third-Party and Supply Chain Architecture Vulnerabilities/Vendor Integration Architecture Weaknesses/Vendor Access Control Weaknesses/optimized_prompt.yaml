  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, analyze the SolarWinds supply chain attack: How did vendor access control weaknesses
    enable it? What NIST controls (AC-6, SR-3, PE-3) could have mitigated it, and how do these relate to Zero Trust Architecture?
    Debate the trade-offs between vendor convenience and security.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: (1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Full access OK
    if trusted vendor'' vs. least privilege); (2) Confused concepts (e.g., mix AC-6 with PE-3); (3) Partial truths (e.g.,
    ''Audits only at onboarding''); (4) Real-world pitfalls (e.g., SolarWinds distractor: ''Software updates don''t need SR
    controls''). Ensure distractors teach by contrast.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² CISSP domains. Topic:
  **Vendor Access Control Weaknesses** (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Security Architecture
  Vulnerabilities > Third-Party and Supply Chain Architecture Vulnerabilities > Vendor Integration Architecture Weaknesses
  > Vendor Access Control Weaknesses). Use the provided learning_objectives, active_learning, scaffolding (including prior_knowledge,
  big_picture_context, concept_map_structure), and flashcard_schema EXACTLY.


  Incorporate: Prior knowledge anchors; Big picture (Zero Trust, 70% breaches); Real-world cases (SolarWinds, Target); Full
  NIST details (AC-2/AC-6, PS-3, SR-3, PE-2/PE-3); Sources (NIST 800-53r5, 800-161r1).


  Generate flashcards per schema: 25-35 cards, balanced coverage, varied types. Ensure pedagogical depth: progressive Bloom''s,
  active recall, spaced repetition friendly. Output ONLY a JSON array of card objects, e.g., [{''front'': ''...'', ''options'':
  [...], ''back'': {...}, ''type'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''related_layer'': ''...''}, ...]. No extra text.'
