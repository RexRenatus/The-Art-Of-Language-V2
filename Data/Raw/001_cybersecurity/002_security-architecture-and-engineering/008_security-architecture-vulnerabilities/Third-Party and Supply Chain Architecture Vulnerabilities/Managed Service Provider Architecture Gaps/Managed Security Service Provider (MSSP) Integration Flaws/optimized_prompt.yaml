active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of outsourcing security to an MSSP versus maintaining in-house
    capabilities. Use real-world examples like the SolarWinds breach to argue how integration flaws amplified supply chain
    risks, and propose mitigations grounded in shared responsibility models.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (2) Related but incorrect concept (e.g., confuse with cloud-only shared model), (3) Partial truth (e.g., valid for another
    flaw). Ensure distractors are realistic from voter consensus flaws/sources.'
