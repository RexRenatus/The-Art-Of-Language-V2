  COMPLETE Research Context (synthesized from web sources like cyber.gc.ca, sans.org; voter consensus on full risks):


  Core Concepts:

  - SOC: Centralized unit for monitoring, detecting, analyzing, responding to threats.

  - SOC Outsourcing: Delegating to MSSP (partial/full).

  - MSSP: Third-party for security monitoring/management.

  - SOCaaS: Subscription SOC.

  - Shared Responsibility Model: Splits duties (MSSP: monitoring/tools; Customer: configs, access, patching, incident ownership).


  Key Risks (full list w/ description, impact, mitigation):

  1. Loss of Visibility/Control: Reduced oversight. Impact: Delayed detection/response. Mitigation: Contractual log access,
  audits, clear shared model docs.

  2. Data Privacy Concerns: Sharing sensitive data. Impact: Breaches, GDPR fines. Mitigation: Data Processing Agreements (DPAs),
  encryption, audits.

  3. Vendor Reliability: MSSP downtime. Impact: Incident blind spots. Mitigation: SLAs (99.9% uptime), backups, multi-vendor.

  4. Compliance Issues: Regulatory gaps. Impact: Fines/penalties. Mitigation: Require SOC2/ISO certs, contract clauses.

  5. Single Point of Failure: Over-reliance. Impact: Total SOC outage. Mitigation: Hybrid models, redundancy.

  6. Insider Threats: MSSP staff access. Impact: Malicious actions. Mitigation: Background checks, least privilege, monitoring.

  7. Vendor Lock-in: Switching difficulty. Impact: High costs/suboptimal service. Mitigation: Open standards, exit clauses.

  8. IP Risks: Proprietary exposure. Impact: Theft. Mitigation: NDAs, data minimization.


  Benefits (context): Cost savings, expertise, 24/7. Voter formative assessments: Include as cards - MCQ1: Primary SOC outsourcing
  risk? A) Increased control B) Loss of visibility/control (correct) C) Always cheaper D) No expertise. Expl: Outsourcing
  reduces oversight; review shared model. MCQ2: MSSP? A) Managed SOC B) Managed Security Service Provider (correct) C) Main
  SOC D) Multi-Site. MCQ3: Shared Model? A) Provider all B) Split duties (correct) C) Customer sole D) None.
