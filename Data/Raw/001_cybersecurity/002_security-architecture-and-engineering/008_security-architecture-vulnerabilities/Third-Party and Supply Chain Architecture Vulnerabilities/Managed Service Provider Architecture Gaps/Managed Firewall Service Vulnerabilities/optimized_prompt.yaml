active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the risks of relying on a managed firewall service versus an in-house solution. What unique
    vulnerabilities arise from third-party management (e.g., configuration drift, shared tenant risks), and how can organizations
    mitigate them through SLAs, regular audits, and compliance with NIST SP 800-41?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    ''Managed services eliminate config drift'' – ignores provider gaps); (2) Partial truths (e.g., lists self-hosted risk
    as managed); (3) Opposites (e.g., ''Enhanced logging is unnecessary''); (4) Real-world examples twisted (e.g., shared
    tenant as ''isolated benefit''). Ensure distractors are plausible from research (e.g., Azure multi-tenant issues).'

  Generate high-quality Anki-style flashcards for the topic ''Managed Firewall Service Vulnerabilities'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity
  > Security Architecture And Engineering > Security Architecture Vulnerabilities > Third-Party and Supply Chain Architecture
  Vulnerabilities > Managed Service Provider Architecture Gaps > Managed Firewall Service Vulnerabilities). Use Bloom''s Taxonomy,
  active learning, and 4-layer scaffolding for optimized retention.


  **Research Context (Incorporate fully):** Managed Firewall Service: Third-party provider handles config, monitoring, maintenance.
  Vulnerabilities: config drift (divergence over time), provider access gaps, logging deficiencies, integration issues, misconfigs,
  shared tenant risks (noisy neighbors), patching delays, insufficient logging, supply chain risks, insider threats. Standards:
  NIST SP 800-41 Rev1 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-41r1.pdf) – firewall types/policy;
  MCSB (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/); Azure Well-Architected Framework Security Pillar (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/security/)
  – network controls, supply chain. Sources: NIST.gov, Microsoft Learn, CISSP domains.


  **Learning Objectives:** [Insert the exact array from ''learning_objectives'' above].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Draw scenarios from discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving for applied cards.


  **Scaffolding:** [Insert exact descriptions from ''scaffolding'' above].


  **Output exactly:** Valid JSON array of 40-50 flashcards following the precise ''flashcard_schema'' structure. Balance:
  20% Layer1/Remember-Understand, 30% Layer2-3/Apply-Analyze, 50% Layer4/Evaluate-Create. 70% MCQ, 30% Q&A. Ensure web-grounded
  (cite sources), misconception distractors, and voter priorities (e.g., specific vulns, NIST/MCSB).'
