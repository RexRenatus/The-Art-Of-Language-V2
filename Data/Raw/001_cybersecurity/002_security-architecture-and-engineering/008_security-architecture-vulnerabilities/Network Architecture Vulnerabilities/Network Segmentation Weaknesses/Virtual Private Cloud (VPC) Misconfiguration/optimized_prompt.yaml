active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between convenience and security when configuring VPC subnets for a multi-tier
    web application (e.g., web servers, app servers, databases). Is a single subnet ever justifiable? Support with real-world
    breach examples like Capital One.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains Security Groups using a real AWS scenario (e.g., allowing HTTP/HTTPS only
    from an ALB), then switches to explain NACLs (e.g., subnet-level deny rules). Peers quiz each other on differences.
  problem_solving: Provide a diagram of a misconfigured VPC (e.g., database in public subnet with IGW, SG allowing 0.0.0.0/0
    SSH). Students identify 3+ vulnerabilities, propose fixes, and redesign with private subnets, bastion hosts, and NACLs.

    (e.g., ''Block all traffic by default''). Ensure plausible via real misconfigs.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert cybersecurity educator specializing in AWS VPC misconfigurations, certified in CISSP and
  AWS Security. Generate 30 high-quality flashcards for ''Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Misconfiguration'' (Category: Cybersecurity
  > Security Architecture And Engineering > Security Architecture Vulnerabilities > Network Architecture Vulnerabilities >
  Network Segmentation Weaknesses > VPC Misconfiguration).


  **Research Context (Complete):** VPC: Logically isolated AWS network (custom CIDR, subnets). Subnet: IP range in one AZ.
  SGs: Stateful instance firewalls (allow-only). NACLs: Stateless subnet firewalls (allow/deny, numbered). IGW: Enables VPC-Internet
  access (attach to public route tables). Common misconfigs: 1) Private resources (e.g., DB) in public subnets; 2) Permissive
  SGs/NACLs (0.0.0.0/0 inbound); 3) No segmentation (single subnet); 4) Default VPC public exposure. Risks: Breaches (e.g.,
  Capital One). Best practices: Least privilege, defense-in-depth, Well-Architected Security Pillar. Sources: [AWS VPC User
  Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/), [Security Pillar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/),
  [IGW Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html).


  **Pedagogy:** Align to these objectives: [insert learning_objectives array]. Use scaffolding layers: [insert scaffolding
  object]. Promote active learning via recall questions mimicking [insert active_learning object].


  **Generation Rules:** Follow exact flashcard_schema. Cover all Bloom''s levels proportionally. Ensure active recall (no
  cloze). Vary difficulty. Embed real scenarios/breaches. Prior knowledge: Assumes IP/CIDR/firewalls basics.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 30 flashcards, e.g., [{''id'':1, ''front'':''...'', ...}]. No extra text.'
