active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs between using canned policies versus custom policies for signed URLs in a cloud
    storage system. When would you choose one over the other, and how does it impact leakage risk? This sparks debate on usability
    vs. security.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions (e.g., 'HTTPS prevents all leakage'
    ignoring logs/user error; 'Canned policies are always more secure' ignoring flexibility risks; 'Long expiration is fine
    if signed'). Draw from voter-noted misconceptions, research risks, and active learning debates. Ensure distractors are
    realistic errors from partial knowledge.

  Full Synthesized Content (Web-grounded research + voter consensus completions):


  Core Concepts:

  - Signed URL: URL with query-string auth (signature via private key) for time-limited resource access.

  - Policy Statement: JSON defining expiration, IP, methods.

  - Canned Policy: Predefined, simple (mainly expiration).

  - Custom Policy: Granular control.

  - Key Management: Generate/store/rotate/revoke keys securely.

  - Leakage: Unauthorized exposure of valid signed URL.


  Risks/Attack Vectors:

  - Insecure Transmission: HTTP allows MITM interception.

  - Logging Errors: Captured in server/app/debug logs, scraped by attackers.

  - Referer Headers: Exposed when linking from sites.

  - User Error/Social Engineering: Accidental sharing (email, Slack, pastebins), phishing (tricked to forward), shoulder surfing.


  Best Practices/Mitigations:

  - Short expiration (minutes).

  - HTTPS-only.

  - Never log signed URLs.

  - Secure key mgmt (rotation, HSM).

  - Granular policies (IP/methods).

  - Monitoring: Alerts on anomalies.

  - Prefer canned for simplicity unless custom needed.

  Real-world: AWS S3 presigned URL breaches via GitHub leaks/logs.


  Prior knowledge: Basic URLs, digital sigs, S3.
