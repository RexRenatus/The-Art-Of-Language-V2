active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a hybrid cloud environment, how do CASB gaps like limited visibility into encrypted traffic or Shadow
    IT evasion contribute to data breaches? Debate the trade-offs between inline and API-based CASB deployments and propose
    organizational policy changes.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: (1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''CASBs fully
    block all Shadow IT'' vs. reality of evasion gaps), (2) Partial truths from research (e.g., confuse inline vs. API modes),
    (3) Related but incorrect concepts (e.g., mix DLP with threat protection). Ensure distractors test deeper understanding.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security Architecture Vulnerabilities.\
  \ Generate 40-60 high-quality flashcards on 'Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) Gaps' using university pedagogy: Bloom's\
  \ Taxonomy (span all levels per objectives), active learning ties, and scaffolding layers.\n\n**Topic Hierarchy Context:**\n\
  - Level 1: Cybersecurity\n- Level 2: Security Architecture And Engineering\n- Level 3: Security Architecture Vulnerabilities\n\
  - Level 4: Cloud Architecture Vulnerabilities\n- Level 5: Cloud Identity and Access Architecture Flaws\n- Level 6: Cloud\
  \ Access Security Broker (CASB) Gaps\n\n**Research Context:** CASBs enforce policies between users/cloud services for visibility,\
  \ DLP, threat protection, compliance. Key gaps include Shadow IT detection failures, limited visibility (e.g., encrypted/non-web\
  \ traffic), evasion techniques, scalability/integration issues, false positives. Relate to ZTA (NIST SP 1800-35), DLP, Shadow\
  \ IT.\n\n**Learning Objectives:** [Insert the 6 objectives above].\n**Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert the 4 layers above].\n\
