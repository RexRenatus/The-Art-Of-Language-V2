active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a post-pandemic world with increased remote work, debate the relevance of traditional boundary protection
    devices like firewalls and DMZs versus adopting a zero-trust architecture. Use NIST SP 800-53 SC-7 as a reference to support
    your arguments, considering impacts on system boundaries and managed interfaces.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions: 1) superficially similar term
    (e.g., ''router'' vs. ''firewall''), 2) outdated/inaccurate concept (e.g., ''perimeter-only security'' vs. ''internal
    interfaces''), 3) edge case confusion (e.g., ''DMZ'' as fully trusted vs. semi-trusted). Ensure distractors are derived
    from research context (e.g., mixing NIST SC-7 with unrelated controls) or voter-noted pitfalls (e.g., internal switch
    as boundary).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in CISSP Domain 3: Security
  Architecture and Engineering. Topic: Boundary Protection Devices (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering
  > Information Systems Security Capabilities > System and Communications Protection > Network Boundary Protection > Boundary
  Protection Devices). Use this research context: Boundary protection monitors/controls communications at external/key internal
  interfaces to protect CIA triad (NIST SP 800-53 Rev 4/5 SC-7). Key concepts: system boundary (perimeter including data flows),
  managed interfaces (gateways, firewalls, etc.), DMZ (semi-trusted subnetwork). Devices: firewalls (NIST SP 800-41: packet/stateful/next-gen),
  proxies, guards, IDS/IPS. Big picture: Enables defense-in-depth, secure system design.


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Active Learning: [insert discussion_prompt, peer_teaching_activity, problem_solving_exercise].

  - Scaffolding: Generate flashcards balanced across 4 layers [insert full scaffolding details].

  - Concept Map: Central ''Boundary Protection Devices'' → Devices (Firewalls, Guards), Locations (Interfaces, DMZ), Standards
  (SC-7), Dependencies (Boundary Definition).


  Generate flashcards following this exact schema: [insert full flashcard_schema details]. Output as structured JSON: {''flashcards'':
