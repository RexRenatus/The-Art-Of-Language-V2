      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The System and Services Acquisition (SA) control family is paramount because it integrates security and privacy considerations directly into the acquisition process, from initial requirements to final acceptance. This proactive approach ensures that systems are developed and procured with security and privacy built-in, rather than being an afterthought, thereby reducing risks throughout the system development life cycle.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors represent related but distinct functions: CM manages system state, CP handles recovery, and PM provides high-level strategy, none of which directly address the secure acquisition lifecycle as comprehensively as SA.",
        "analogy": "The SA control family is like the procurement department for building materials; it ensures that only secure, high-quality, and appropriate materials (systems and services) are acquired for construction (development and operation)."
