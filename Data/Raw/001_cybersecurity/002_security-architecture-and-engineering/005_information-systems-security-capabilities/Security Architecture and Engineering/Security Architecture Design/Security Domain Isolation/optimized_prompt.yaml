  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Security domain isolation is more critical in Zero Trust
    architectures than in traditional perimeter-based models.'' Provide evidence from NIST SP 800-53 and SP 800-207, and connect
    to real-world breaches like SolarWinds. Identify strengths, limitations, and improvements.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

    rules:
    - 'Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., ''Isolation allows all traffic within domain'' vs. least privilege).'
    - 'Distractor 2: Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''VLANs provide full encryption'' vs. segmentation only).'
    - 'Distractor 3: Opposite/extreme (e.g., ''Zero Trust relies on perimeter'' vs. domain isolation).'
    - Base on voter priorities (e.g., incomplete NIST controls), research (e.g., ZTA vs. perimeter), and frequent errors in
      cybersecurity (lateral movement assumptions).
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security Domain Isolation
  (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information Systems Security Capabilities > Security
  Architecture Design > Security Domain Isolation). Voter consensus (100% approval) emphasizes completeness (NIST SP 800-53:
  AC-3 Access Enforcement, AC-4 Information Flow Enforcement, SC-7 Boundary Protection), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression, 4-layer
  scaffolding, active learning), and practical examples (VLANs, firewalls, Zero Trust per NIST SP 800-207).


  Generate 50-75 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Spaced Repetition using the exact schema:

  - Front: Question

  - Back: {answer, explanation (reference scaffolding/NIST/research), bloom_level, scaffolding_layer, distractors (if MC)}

  Vary types: 30% remember/understand cloze, 40% apply/analyze MC (4 options, 1 correct), 30% evaluate/create open-ended.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the array above]

  - Scaffolding: [paste the scaffolding object above]

  - Active Learning: Tie explanations to prompts where relevant.

  - Research: Domain isolation limits breaches via segmentation; integrates least privilege, defense-in-depth, ZTA.


  Ensure coverage: 20% Layer 1, 25% Layer 2, 30% Layer 3, 25% Layer 4. Distractors per protocol. Output as JSON array of flashcards.'
