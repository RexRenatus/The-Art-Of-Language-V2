The model creates 'walls' to segregate such information, thereby maintaining confidentiality and preventing unethical practices. This works by enforcing access controls that are sensitive to potential conflicts of interest, thereby safeguarding sensitive information.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors misattribute the model's primary focus to integrity/availability, authentication/authorization, or non-repudiation/accountability. While these are important security aspects, the Chinese Wall model's unique contribution and primary concern lie in managing confidentiality through the lens of conflict of interest prevention.",
        "analogy": "It's like a doctor who must maintain patient confidentiality. If the doctor also has a financial stake in a company that manufactures a drug being prescribed, they must ensure that their decision to prescribe is based solely on patient well-being, not their financial interest. The model ensures confidentiality by managing potential conflicts."
