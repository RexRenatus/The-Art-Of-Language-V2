  discussion_prompt: 'Compare internal vs. external penetration testing: Discuss unique risks of internal threats (e.g., malicious
    insiders with initial access or compromised hosts) and how frameworks like PTES or NIST SP 800-115 adapt methodologies.
    Debate the trade-offs of ''zero-knowledge'' vs. ''full-knowledge'' scenarios in internal tests, considering real-world
    implications for organizations like those handling PCI DSS compliance.'
  peer_teaching: 'Pair students: One student explains the 7 PTES phases (Pre-engagement Interactions, Intelligence Gathering,
    Threat Modeling, Vulnerability Analysis, Exploitation, Post-Exploitation, Reporting), focusing on internal adaptations
    (e.g., lateral movement in Post-Exploitation); the partner teaches back using a concrete internal network example (e.g.,
    Active Directory enumeration with BloodHound). Switch roles and provide feedback on accuracy and clarity.'
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: You have compromised an internal host in a corporate network (e.g., via phishing). In small
    groups, plan lateral movement and privilege escalation using NIST SP 800-115 techniques (e.g., enumeration, exploitation
    with Metasploit). Identify potential mitigations (e.g., least privilege, network segmentation), simulate the attack path,
    and prepare a report with findings and recommendations. Debrief as a class.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for university-level cybersecurity education on ''Internal Penetration
  Testing'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information Systems Security Capabilities
  > Vulnerability and Patch Management > Penetration Testing > Internal Penetration Testing). Synthesize 20-30 high-quality,
  spaced-repetition optimized flashcards covering the full topic, integrating university pedagogy (Bloom''s Taxonomy progression:
  30% Remember/Understand, 40% Apply/Analyze, 30% Evaluate/Create), voter consensus (100% approval: completeness on PCI DSS/NIST/PTES/tools
  like Metasploit/BloodHound/case studies; 4-layer scaffolding; active learning), and web-grounded research (PTES 7 phases:
  https://pentest-standard.readthedocs.io; NIST SP 800-115: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-115.pdf;
  PCI DSS Req 11.4: quarterly internal PT on cardholder segments https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org; tools/examples/prerequisites
  like networking/vuln mgmt/external PT).


  Use these EXACT learning objectives: [insert array from above]. Incorporate active learning for context (e.g., flashcards
  prompting discussion/peer teach/problem-solving). Structure content via 4 scaffolding layers: [insert scaffolding descriptions].
  Ensure completeness: full PTES phases, PCI DSS (internal scope/reme diation), tools (Nmap, Metasploit, BloodHound), integration
  (vuln mgmt/compliance/case studies like insider pivots).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards, each matching this EXACT schema: [insert schema description and example]. Vary question
  types (MCQ with 3 distractors, cloze, short answer prompts). Distractors: plausible, misconception-based, with explanations.
  Explanations: tie to objectives/layers/research/sources. No additional text.'
