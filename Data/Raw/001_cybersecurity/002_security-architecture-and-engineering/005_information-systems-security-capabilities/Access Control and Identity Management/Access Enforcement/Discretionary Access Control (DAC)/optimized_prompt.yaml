active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios might DAC be preferable to MAC (e.g., commercial OS like Unix/Windows for user flexibility),
    and what risks does it introduce (e.g., Trojan horse attacks via over-granting)? Debate with real-world examples from
    file systems.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'From research/voters: E.g., mix principles like ''complete mediation'' with wrong ones.'
    - 'Progressive difficulty: Layer 1 distractors simple (wrong term), Layer 4 complex (subtle differences like DAC vs. RBAC
      ownership).'
    - 'Balance: 40% from each layer/objective group.'

  \ content to generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards:\n\n**Learning Objectives (Bloom's Taxonomy):** [Insert full\
  \ learning_objectives array here]\n\n**Active Learning Integration:** Weave in elements from discussion prompts, peer activities,\
  \ and problem-solving into scenario questions for application.\n\n**Scaffolding Layers:** Strictly cover in sequence: [Insert\
  \ full scaffolding_layers here]. Ensure flashcards progress from Layer 1 to 4.\n\n**Voter Consensus & Research Context:**\
  \ 100% approval. Include completeness (full RBAC: Role-Based Access Control assigns permissions via roles by admins, contrasts\
  \ DAC's owner discretion; use cases: enterprises). Principles from Cornell: subjects/objects, complete mediation, etc. Examples:\
  \ Unix chmod, Windows ACLs.\n\n**Output Format (JSON Array of Flashcards):** Each flashcard as:\n{\n  \"id\": unique_number,\n\
  \  \"front\": \"Question text\",\n  \"back\": {\n    \"answer\": \"Correct answer\",\n    \"explanation\": \"Detailed explanation\

  **Flashcard Schema & Distractors:** [Insert full flashcard_schema here]. For MCQs, generate 3 distractors per protocol.\n\
  \nGenerate 50 flashcards: Balanced across layers (12-13 each), objectives, and types (30% MCQ). Ensure active recall, no\
