It works by defining the service, assessing impacts, selecting initial assurance levels, tailoring those levels based on detailed risk assessments (privacy, customer experience, threat resistance), and establishing continuous evaluation.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors misrepresent DIRM's scope by limiting it to technical requirements, mandating specific methods, or claiming it automates workflows, rather than focusing on its core function of risk assessment and control selection.",
        "analogy": "DIRM is like a risk assessment before building a house – it helps decide how strong the foundation (identity proofing), locks (authentication), and communication systems (federation) need to be based on the potential threats and the value of what's inside."
