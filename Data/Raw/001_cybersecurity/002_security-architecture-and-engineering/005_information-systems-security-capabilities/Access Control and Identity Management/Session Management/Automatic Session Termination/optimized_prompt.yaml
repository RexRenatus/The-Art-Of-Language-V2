active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In what scenarios might a strict automatic session termination policy hinder user productivity more than
    it enhances security? Compare banking applications (high security needs) versus collaborative tools like Google Docs (high
    usability needs), debating trade-offs between security, usability, and compliance with NIST SP 800-53 AC-12.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
