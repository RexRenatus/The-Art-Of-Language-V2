active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student teaches the other the differences between resilience and redundancy using hand-drawn
    diagrams (e.g., resilience as graceful degradation, redundancy as duplication). Include examples from geographic distribution.
    Switch roles, then provide peer feedback on clarity and accuracy.
  problem_solving: Individually or in teams, design a DR plan for a cloud-based e-commerce service using three geo-regions
    (e.g., AWS US-East-1, EU-West-1, Asia-Pacific). Specify replication (sync/async), failover steps, RTO/RPO targets (<4
    hours / <15 min), and testing protocols. Present and critique peer designs.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (70% of cards): Generate 3 plausible distractors based on: 1) Common misconceptions (e.g.,
    ''geo-distribution prevents all risks'' ignoring correlated events); 2) Partial truths (e.g., confuse RTO with RPO); 3)
    Related but wrong concepts (e.g., local AZ redundancy vs. geo-regions); 4) Voter-noted gaps (e.g., truncated NIST refs).
    Ensure one best answer.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert cybersecurity educator and flashcard generator, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Generate
  high-quality, pedagogically optimized flashcards for the topic ''Geographic Distribution'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security
  Architecture And Engineering > Information Systems Security Capabilities > Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery > Resilience
  and Redundancy > Geographic Distribution). Voter consensus: 82.9% approval (7 voters) emphasizes completeness (NIST CSF
  full: Govern.GV.SC-02, Protect.PR.DS-5/PR.IP-4/PR.IR-1/2, Detect.DE.CM-8, Respond.RS.MI-3, Recover.RC.RP-1/RC.IM-1), Bloom''s
  progression, 4-layer scaffolding, prior knowledge links (centralized/distributed systems, SPOF, basic redundancy), big picture
  (enables resilient BC/DR architectures), and concept map (Geographic Distribution → Resilience → Availability → BC/DR; NIST
  links).


  Core content from research: Geographic distribution = strategic multi-location placement for resilience/availability. Key
  terms: Distributed systems, resilience (graceful degradation), redundancy (duplication), BC/DR, RTO/RPO. Standards: NIST
  CSF 2.0/SP 800-34/800-53 (CP-2/3), ISO 22301, cloud (AWS Regions, Azure GRS). Risks: Latency, cost, correlated failures
  (pandemics). Best practices: Replication/failover, site selection, testing.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [paste the 6 objectives above].

  - Active learning hooks: Weave in discussion/peer-teach/problem-solving scenarios (e.g., multinational bank DR plan).

  - Scaffolding: [paste the 4 layers above] - Ensure coverage.

  - Prior knowledge: Link to SPOF/redundancy.


  Output EXACTLY per flashcard_schema: JSON array of 25-35 cards. 50% MCQ, 50% Q/A. Balance: Layers 1-4 equally; Bloom''s
  as noted. High engagement: Questions mimic active learning (e.g., ''Critique this scenario...''). Promote university pedagogy:
  Scaffolded, measurable (e.g., ''List 3...''), misconception-busting distractors. Sources always referenced.'
