active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between aggressive RTO/RPO targets (e.g., near-zero downtime)
    and cost implications for a mid-sized e-commerce company facing ransomware. How does this align with NIST SP 800-184's
    emphasis on realistic recovery playbooks? Support with examples from real-world breaches like WannaCry.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Plausible but incorrect: e.g., confuse RTO (time) with RPO (data loss); mix DR (IT) with BC (business).'
    - 'Common misconceptions: e.g., ''DRP eliminates all downtime'' (false, minimizes).'
    - 'Edge cases: e.g., regulatory-specific (GDPR vs. HIPAA).'
    - 'Frequency: 70% scenario-based, 20% definition, 10% comparison.'
    - 'Balance: Even distribution across Bloom''s levels and scaffolding layers.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  Disaster Recovery Plan Development (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information Systems
  Security Capabilities > Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery > Disaster Recovery Planning > Disaster Recovery Plan
  Development). Consensus: 100% voter approval on pedagogy/scaffolding/completeness.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above]

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to activities (e.g., ''Use in peer quiz'')

  - Scaffolding: Distribute evenly (5-8 per layer)

  - Research Context: DR/BC/RTO/RPO/CIA; NIST SP 800-184 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/184/final); ISO 27001; GDPR Art.
  32 (full: restore personal data availability post-incident); COBIT/CIS if relevant.


  Use exact Flashcard Schema: Multiple choice (1 correct + 3 distractors per protocol). Balance Bloom''s levels. Output ONLY
  a JSON array of 25 flashcards, each as {"front": "Question?", "back": {"correct_answer": "...", "distractors": ["A", "B",
  "C"], "explanation": "...", "bloom_level": "...", "scaffolding_layer": "...", "active_learning_tie": "..."}}. Ensure pedagogical
  progression, no hallucinations, cite sources in explanations.'
