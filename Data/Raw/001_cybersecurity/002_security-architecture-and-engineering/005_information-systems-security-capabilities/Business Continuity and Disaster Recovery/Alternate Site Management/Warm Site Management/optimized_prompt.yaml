active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In groups, debate the trade-offs of warm sites versus hot and cold sites for a mid-sized e-commerce company
    facing cyber threats. Consider RTO/RPO requirements, costs, scalability, and security implications. Which option is optimal
    and why? Be prepared to present your group's consensus with supporting evidence from NIST SP 800-34.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs only.
    - 'Distractors must be common misconceptions or near-misses (e.g., for ''warm site RTO'': ''minutes'' [hot site], ''days''
      [cold site], ''zero'' [mirrored]).'
    - 'Base on research context: Use hot/cold site traits, incorrect RTO/RPO values, or partial definitions.'
    - Ensure one distractor is a frequent error (e.g., confusing warm with fully redundant hot sites).
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  Warm Site Management (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information Systems Security Capabilities
  > Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery > Alternate Site Management > Warm Site Management). Use the provided learning
  objectives, active learning activities, 4-layer scaffolding, research context (warm site as partially provisioned for hours-RTO;
  NIST SP 800-34 7-step process: BIA, strategies, TT&E; RTO/RPO; Azure Site Recovery/Well-Architected Framework for resilience),
  and flashcard schema EXACTLY.


  Generate 50 flashcards following the schema. Balance Bloom''s levels and layers. For MCQs, apply distractor protocol strictly.
  Ensure content is accurate, university-level (Bloom''s integrated), and promotes active learning (e.g., scenario-based Qs
  from problem-solving exercise). Output as JSON array of objects, each with all schema fields. No extra text.'
