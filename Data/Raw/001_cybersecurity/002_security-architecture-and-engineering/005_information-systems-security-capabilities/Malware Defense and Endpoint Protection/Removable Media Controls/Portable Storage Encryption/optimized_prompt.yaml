active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the advantages and disadvantages of Full Disk Encryption (FDE) versus File/Folder Encryption for
    portable USB drives in an enterprise setting. Reference NIST SP 800-111 recommendations on key management, pre-boot authentication,
    and consider usability, performance, and security trade-offs in high-mobility environments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (e.g., ''BitLocker doesn''t support USB''), 3) Confusions (e.g., swap FDE with file encryption). Ensure plausible for
    learners at that Bloom''s level; avoid obvious wrongs.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education. Topic: Portable Storage Encryption (Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information Systems Security Capabilities > Malware Defense and
  Endpoint Protection > Removable Media Controls > Portable Storage Encryption). Use the provided learning_objectives, active_learning
  components (for context/inspiration), scaffolding layers (as core content source), and flashcard_schema exactly.


  Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards strictly following the flashcard_schema JSON structure. Output ONLY a JSON array
  of flashcard objects.


  Incorporate:

  - Bloom''s progression: Map cards to objectives.

  - Scaffolding: Source content from layers progressively.

  - Active elements: Include cards inspired by discussion (trade-offs), peer teaching (key mgmt), problem-solving (scenarios).

  - NIST SP 800-111 fully: Recommends FDE for full protection, volume for media, strong key mgmt (separate keys, PBA), challenges
  (overhead, training).

  - Best practices: AES-256, MFA, tools like BitLocker/VeraCrypt.


  Ensure cards are optimized for Anki/Quizlet: concise fronts, detailed backs, explanations tie to real-world/pedagogy. Distractors
  per protocol.'
