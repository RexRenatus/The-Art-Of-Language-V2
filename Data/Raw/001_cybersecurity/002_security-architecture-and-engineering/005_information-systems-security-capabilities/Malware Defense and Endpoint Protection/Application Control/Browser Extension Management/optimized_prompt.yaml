active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between user productivity and security in browser extension management. Should
    organizations enforce a whitelist of approved extensions or allow user choice with oversight? Use OWASP Browser Extension
    Vulnerabilities Cheat Sheet and MITRE ATT&CK examples (e.g., T1176.001) to support arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: Distractors must be plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., 'official stores are safe' → distractor
    claiming Chrome Web Store extensions are vetted; confuse permissions with features; mix up MITRE techniques). Ensure 1-2
    distractors are partially correct to test analysis.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom''s Taxonomy, active
  learning, and scaffolding. Topic: Browser Extension Management (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering
  > Information Systems Security Capabilities > Malware Defense and Endpoint Protection > Application Control > Browser Extension
  Management). Voter consensus: 100% approval on pedagogy, completeness, scaffolding.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the array above]

  - Active Learning: [include discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving as scenario prompts for cards]

  - Scaffolding: Use 4 layers exactly as defined [paste scaffolding JSON].

  - Research: Core concepts (extensions, permissions, attack surface, vulns like XSS/data leakage), OWASP Browser Extension
  Vulnerabilities Cheat Sheet, MITRE ATT&CK T1176.001, best practices (allowlists, audits).


  Generate 25 high-quality MCQ flashcards following the exact schema: {''question'': ''...'', ''correct_answer'': ''...'',
  ''distractors'': [''...'', ''...'', ''...''], ''explanation'': ''...''}. Distribute: Layer 1 (6 cards, remember/understand),
  Layer 2 (6, understand/apply), Layer 3 (7, apply/analyze), Layer 4 (6, analyze/evaluate/create). Tag each explanation with
  Bloom''s level, layer, and active learning tie-in if applicable. Distractors: Plausible misconceptions. Ensure university-level
  rigor, active recall, spaced repetition friendly.'
