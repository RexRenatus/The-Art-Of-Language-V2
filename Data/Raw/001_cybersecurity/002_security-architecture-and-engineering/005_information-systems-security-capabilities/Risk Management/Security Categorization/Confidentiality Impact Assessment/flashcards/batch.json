        "core_logic": "Information Flow Enforcement (AC-4) is crucial for confidentiality because it controls where CUI can travel within and between systems, preventing unauthorized transfers, thereby maintaining data secrecy.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors confuse information flow with access control (who can access), encryption (how data is protected during transit), and auditing (recording actions), targeting common misunderstandings of these related concepts.",
        "analogy": "Information Flow Enforcement is like a border control agent checking passports and cargo to ensure only authorized movement between countries happens, not just who can enter a specific building."
