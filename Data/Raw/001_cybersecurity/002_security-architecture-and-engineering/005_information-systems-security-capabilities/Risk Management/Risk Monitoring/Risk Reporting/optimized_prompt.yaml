active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How should risk reports differ when communicating to technical teams versus C-suite executives? Provide
    examples of what to include/exclude and why, considering stakeholder needs and potential misconceptions like oversimplifying
    technical risks for executives.
  peer_teaching: 'Pair students: One student explains the structure and key elements of a Cybersecurity Risk Register (CSRR)
    to their partner using NIST CSF examples; the partner teaches back by creating a simple CSRR entry for a hypothetical
    vulnerability (e.g., unpatched software).'
  problem_solving: 'Real-world exercise: Given a scenario (e.g., a phishing campaign affecting the organization), students
    analyze risks using NIST CSF Tiers, populate a risk register, and draft a risk report recommending mitigations. Emphasize
    practical application and addressing misconceptions like ignoring likelihood vs. impact.'

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  Risk Reporting (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information Systems Security Capabilities
  > Risk Management > Risk Monitoring > Risk Reporting). Use the provided research context, complete NIST sections (e.g.,
  NIST CSF 2.0 Functions: Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover; NISTIR 8286 on ERM integration), and sources:
  NIST CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), NISTIR 8286 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8286), NIST SP 800-39 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-39).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [insert array above]

  - Active learning: [insert active_learning object above] (weave into explanations).

  - Scaffolding: Structure flashcards across 4 layers [insert scaffolding above]; tag each with layer.

  - Prior knowledge: Risk identification/assessment from Risk Monitoring.

  - Formative assessments: Include 2-3 sample MCQs in explanations.


  Generate flashcards per schema: [insert flashcard_schema above]. Output as JSON array of objects, e.g., [{''front'': ''...'',
  ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''bloom_level'': ''...'', ''layer'': ''1'', ''type'': ''MCQ'', ''distractors'':
  [''A'', ''B'', ''C'']}, ...]. Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition, higher-order thinking. Voter
  priorities: completeness (full NISTIR), pedagogy (Bloom''s progression).'
