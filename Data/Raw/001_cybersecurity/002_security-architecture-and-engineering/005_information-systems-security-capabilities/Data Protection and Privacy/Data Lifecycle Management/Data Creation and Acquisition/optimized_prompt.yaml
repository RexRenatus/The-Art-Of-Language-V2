  discussion_prompt: 'Debate the trade-offs between data utility and security when acquiring data from untrusted third-party
    sources. How can NIST CSF Protect function controls (e.g., PR.DS-2: Data-in-transit protection) mitigate risks to the
    CIA triad? Consider real-world examples like IoT data feeds.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs based on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Internal data is always secure' vs.
      reality of insider threats).
    - 'Distractors must be realistic: Use partial truths, swapped concepts (e.g., confuse Confidentiality with Integrity),
      or outdated practices.'
    - 'Ensure one distractor per common error: e.g., ignoring external risks, misapplying CIA, incomplete NIST mapping.'
    - 'Balance difficulty: Easy (obvious wrong), Medium (plausible mix-up), Hard (subtle nuance).'
    mcq_format: Question with 4 options (A-D), indicate correct one.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  ''Data Creation and Acquisition'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information Systems
  Security Capabilities > Data Protection and Privacy > Data Lifecycle Management > Data Creation and Acquisition). Use this
  research context: Core concepts include Data Creation (user input, sensors), Data Acquisition (internal/external sources
  like APIs, partners), CIA Triad (Confidentiality: no unauthorized disclosure; Integrity: no improper modification; Availability:
  timely access), Assets. Standards: NIST CSF (Identify: ID.AM asset mgmt; Protect: PR.DS-2 data-in-transit protection); NIST
  SP 800-53 (access controls, encryption); NIST SP 1800-28 (aligns with NIST Cybersecurity Framework for secure data handling
  in practice, e.g., validating sources in wireless/IoT). Emphasize first stage in data lifecycle prevents cascade failures.


  Incorporate these pedagogical elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full array from above]

  - Active Learning: Embed concepts from discussion (trade-offs/utility-security), peer teaching (creation vs acquisition
  risks), problem-solving (healthcare IoT pipeline).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute across 4 layers [insert full scaffolding from above].


  Generate flashcards per this schema: [insert full flashcard_schema from above]. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards,
  each as an object with required fields. Ensure progression through Bloom''s, voter consensus (100% approval on pedagogy/completeness),
  web-grounded accuracy, and distractors per protocol. Vary types for active recall.'
