  discussion_prompt: In a company facing budget constraints, debate whether to sell EOL hardware after data wiping, donate
    it, or physically destroy it. Consider security risks, compliance with NIST SP 800-88, environmental impact, and recovery
    costs of potential breaches. What trade-offs would you prioritize and why?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, Student A explains the full asset lifecycle with a focus on decommissioning and disposal steps
    (using NIST SP 800-37), creating a simple textual diagram or flowchart. Student B teaches it back, addressing potential
    misconceptions like assuming 'delete' permanently erases data. Switch roles and discuss differences.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: A healthcare organization discovers sensitive patient data on auctioned EOL laptops (reference
    real cases like the VA data breach). In groups, develop a step-by-step EOL management plan including inventory audit using
    CAASM principles, sanitization verification per NIST SP 800-88, audit trails, and post-disposal verification.'

  **Research Context (Complete)**: Asset EOL management ensures secure decommissioning/disposal of IT/OT assets to prevent
  breaches. Core concepts: Asset EOL (obsolete/unsupported); Lifecycle (acquisition to disposal); Decommissioning (remove
  from service, data wipe); Disposal (destroy/transfer securely). Tools: CAASM (asset inventory/visibility); SWAM (software
  licenses, compliance, retirement). Standards: NIST SP 800-88 (media sanitization: clear/purge/destroy); NIST SP 800-37 (risk
  mgmt framework); NIST SP 1800-5C (IT Asset Management practice guide: integrates EOL into enterprise asset tracking, emphasizing
  inventory accuracy, automation, and secure retirement to mitigate shadow IT risks).

  Sources: NIST.gov (SP 800-88, 800-37, 1800-5); cyberproof.com (CAASM); ISACA.org (SWAM best practices); real cases (VA laptop
  breach).
