active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs between role-based access control (RBAC) and zoning/masking in storage area networks
    (SANs). Under what scenarios would one be preferable, drawing from NIST SP 800-209 guidelines on data planes? Provide
    real-world examples, such as a healthcare breach due to improper LUN masking, and debate potential misconceptions about
    their interchangeability.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    vs. fabric-level), 2) Partial truths (e.g., valid for another data plane), 3) Extreme opposites (e.g., ''no access control
    needed''), 4) Irrelevant but plausible terms (e.g., mix with network ACLs). Ensure distractors are realistic to challenge
    understanding without being obvious.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, using university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active recall, spaced repetition). Generate high-quality flashcards for the topic ''Storage Media Access
  Control'' (Category: Cybersecurity, Domain: Security Architecture And Engineering, Subdomain: Information Systems Security

  PRIOR KNOWLEDGE: Learners know CIA triad, RBAC, least privilege, separation of duties.


  CONTENT SUMMARY (from NIST SP 800-209 and best practices; completed for fullness): Storage Media Access Control ensures
  authorized access to data on HDDs, SSDs, tapes, cloud/virtual storage. Protects CIA via least privilege, separation of duties.
  Data Planes: Consumption (I/O ops), Management (provision/map, e.g., LUNs), Protection (replication, snapshots, encryption,
  sanitization). Controls: RBAC for files/objects (ACLs, audit logs), SAN zoning (fabric isolation), LUN masking (host access
  restriction). NIST SP 800-209 Sec 4.3.6 File/Object Recommendations: Implement RBAC with MFA, encrypt at rest, log access,
  sanitize media (cross-ref NIST SP 800-88). Sources: NIST SP 800-209 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-209.pdf),
  NIST SP 800-88 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-88r1.pdf), NIST SP 800-53 (AC-3 Access
  Enforcement).


  LEARNING OBJECTIVES: [Insert the exact array from ''learning_objectives'' above].


  SCAFFOLDING LAYERS: [Insert the exact array from ''scaffolding'' above].


  ACTIVE LEARNING SUPPORT: Cards should enable discussion (e.g., trade-offs), peer teaching (explanations), problem-solving
  (scenarios like SAN leaks).


  Output exactly a JSON array of 40-60 flashcards, each strictly following this schema: [Insert the exact ''structure'' from
  ''flashcard_schema'' above]. Ensure comprehensive coverage: all objectives (at least 5-10 cards each), all layers (10+ per
  layer), varied Bloom''s levels. Use distractor protocol precisely. Questions must prompt active recall (e.g., ''What is
  the primary difference between zoning and masking?'', not reading comprehension). Explanations reference research, objectives,
  layers for scaffolding.'
