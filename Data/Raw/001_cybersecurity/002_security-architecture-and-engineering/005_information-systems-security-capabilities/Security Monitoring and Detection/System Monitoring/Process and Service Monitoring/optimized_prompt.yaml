active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a resource-constrained organization, debate the trade-offs between implementing a full ISCM program
    as per NIST SP 800-137 versus targeted process and service monitoring (e.g., using Sysmon). What key metrics (e.g., anomaly
    detection rates, false positives) would you prioritize and why? Consider misconceptions about monitoring scope and real-world
    priorities.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    ongoing awareness); 2) Related but wrong concepts (e.g., ''Sysmon only for networks'' vs. processes); 3) Voter-noted misconceptions
    (overemphasis on full ISCM vs. targeted); 4) Real-world pitfalls (e.g., ignoring false positives). Ensure 70% plausibility

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  Process and Service Monitoring (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information Systems Security
  Capabilities > Security Monitoring and Detection > System Monitoring > Process and Service Monitoring). Use the provided
  Learning Objectives (spanning Bloom''s Taxonomy), Active Learning components, Scaffolding (4 layers), and Flashcard Schema
  to generate 50-75 high-quality flashcards.


  Incorporate: NIST SP 800-137 (ISCM strategy), NIST SP 800-137A (program assessment), tools (Sysmon, Splunk/ELK), real-world
  examples (anomalous processes, SIEM integration), prior knowledge (OS processes, RMF), concept map (central: Process & Service
  Monitoring -> ISCM -> Detection/Response).


  Generate cards progressively: 15% Layer 1 (REMEMBER/UNDERSTAND), 25% Layer 2 (UNDERSTAND/APPLY), 25% Layer 3 (APPLY/ANALYZE),
  35% Layer 4 (ANALYZE/EVALUATE/CREATE). Mix card types per schema. Ensure active learning tie-ins (e.g., scenario from problem-solving
  exercise).


  Output format: JSON array of objects, each: {''front'': ''Question'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'']}}. No extra text.'
