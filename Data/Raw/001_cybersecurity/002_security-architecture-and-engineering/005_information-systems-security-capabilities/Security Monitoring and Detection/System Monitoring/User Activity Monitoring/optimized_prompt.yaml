active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the ethical trade-offs between comprehensive user activity monitoring for security (e.g., using
    NIST AU-6 for real-time review) and individual privacy rights. Use specific AU controls as a framework and reference real-world
    examples like data breaches.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    with AU-6 Review); (2) Partial truths (e.g., correct control but wrong detail); (3) Plausible alternatives (e.g., unrelated
    NIST control like AC-2); (4) Overgeneralizations (e.g., privacy-focused distractor ignoring security needs). Ensure distractors
    are realistic and derived from topic content.'
