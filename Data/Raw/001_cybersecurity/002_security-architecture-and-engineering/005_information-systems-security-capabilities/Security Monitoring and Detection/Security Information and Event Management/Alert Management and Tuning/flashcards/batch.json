      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The Recover (RC) function is critical because it ensures the restoration of affected systems and operations, thereby minimizing business disruption and returning the organization to a stable state after an incident, as defined in NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors misattribute the purpose of Recover to prevention, root cause analysis, or containment, confusing it with other distinct incident response phases.",
        "analogy": "The Recover function is like the cleanup and rebuilding crew after a natural disaster – their job is to restore normalcy and functionality to the affected areas."
