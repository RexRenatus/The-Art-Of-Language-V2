  Topic: **Tool Performance Optimization** (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information
  Systems Security Capabilities > Security Operations > Security Tool Management > Tool Performance Optimization). Consensus:
  85.7% approval.


  **Completed Research Context:** Tool Performance Optimization enhances security tools'' efficiency/speed while minimizing
  resources/false positives. Key techniques: threshold tuning, false positive reduction (whitelisting/ML), CPU/memory monitoring,
  scalability (auto-scaling), SIEM/IDS integration (e.g., Splunk query tuning, Snort rules optimization). NIST CSF 2.0 (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework):
  Govern (GV: risk mgmt, resource allocation); Identify (ID: assets/tools); Protect (PR: controls); Detect (DE: monitoring
  efficiency); Respond (RS: fast handling); Recover (RC: resilience). Tiers: Partial → Adaptive. Sources: NIST CSF 2.0 (SP
  800-53 rev5), CIS Controls v8 (Control 13: Security Ops), MITRE ATT&CK (tool mappings), Splunk Docs (perf tuning), Snort
  User Manual.
