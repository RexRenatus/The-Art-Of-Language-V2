  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet using the exact schema: Mix Basic Q&A (8), MCQ (10), Cloze
  (5), Scenario (2). Strictly follow distractor protocol. Ensure progression: 30% Layer 1/Remember-Understand, 30% Layer 2-3/Apply-Analyze,
  40% Layer 4/Evaluate-Create. Each card tags: #BloomLevel #Layer #TopicHierarchy. Explanations reference voter consensus
  (e.g., misconceptions), active learning (e.g., ''Relates to discussion on automated vs. manual''). Output ONLY a JSON array:
  [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'', ''tags'': [''...'']}, ...]. Promote
  active recall, spaced repetition, and higher-order thinking.'
