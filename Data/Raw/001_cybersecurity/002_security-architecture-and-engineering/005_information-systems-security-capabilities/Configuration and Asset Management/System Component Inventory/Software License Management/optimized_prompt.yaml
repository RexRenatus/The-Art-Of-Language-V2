active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the security trade-offs of using Open Source Software (OSS) versus proprietary
    software in enterprise environments. Consider factors like license compliance risks, vulnerability disclosure rates, and
    supply chain security. Support arguments with references to NIST CSF (ID.SC-5) and real-world examples like Log4j vulnerabilities.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Content Base:** Use this synthesized research context:

  - Core Concepts: Software License (legal agreement for use/modify/distribute); OSS (public source, e.g., MIT/GPL); Proprietary
  (strict terms); Compliance (adhere to terms); IP Disputes (unauthorized use); License Vulnerabilities (risks from incompatible/expired
  licenses).

  - Standards: OSD (OSI: 10 criteria for open source); FSD (FSF: free as freedom); NIST CSF (complete: Identify-ID.AM-1/2:
  inventory hardware/software; ID.SC-5: supply chain risks; Protect-PR.IP-1: baseline configs; Detect-Respond-Recover for
  incidents). Tools: FOSSology, SPDX.

  - Prior Knowledge: Extends System Component Inventory (software assets) and Configuration/Asset Management (compliance).

  - Sources: NIST CSF (csrc.nist.gov/projects/cybersecurity-framework); OpenSSF (baseline.openssf.org); OSI (opensource.org);
  FSF (gnu.org/philosophy); FOSSology (fossology.org).


  **Pedagogy:** Generate flashcards aligned to these Learning Objectives [insert full list from JSON]. Cover 4 Scaffolding
  Layers [insert summaries].


  **Active Learning Integration:** Tie flashcards to activities where relevant (e.g., scenario Qs link to problem-solving
  exercise).


  **Output 25 flashcards in JSON array:** [{''id'':1, ''layer'':''1'', ''blooms'':''Remember'', ''front'':''...'', ''back'':{''answer'':''...'',
  ''explanation'':''...'', ''related_objective'':''...'', ''active_learning_tie'':''...''}}, ...]


  **Schema:** Strictly follow Flashcard Schema [insert full schema]. Ensure distractors are plausible per protocol. High-quality,
  exam-ready, spaced repetition optimized (active recall, interleaved).'
