active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of CIS Control 1, debate whether DHCP logging alone is sufficient for complete asset inventory
    or if it should be combined with other methods like NAC or agent-based scanning. Provide pros, cons, and a hybrid recommendation.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Plausible but incorrect: Common misconceptions (e.g., DHCP tracks static IPs; MAC is software-based)'
    - 'Related concepts: Confuse with similar tech (e.g., DNS logging vs. DHCP; ARP vs. MAC)'
    - 'Partial truths: Correct element but wrong context (e.g., lease time but wrong field)'
    - 'Edge cases: Outdated standards or incomplete integrations (e.g., no SIEM mention)'
