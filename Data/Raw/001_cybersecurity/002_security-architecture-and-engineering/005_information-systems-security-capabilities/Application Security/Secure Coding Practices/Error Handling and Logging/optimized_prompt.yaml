active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of verbose logging for incident detection versus performance overhead and data
    privacy risks (e.g., logging PII). Reference NIST SP 800-92 and real-world examples like SolarWinds breach investigations.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, explain error handling strategies (e.g., avoiding stack trace leaks, custom error pages) and teach-back
    using code examples from OWASP Secure Coding Practices.
  problem_solving: Analyze and fix a vulnerable application code snippet that leaks sensitive information via error messages;
    implement secure logging with rotation and SIEM forwarding.
  additional_activities:
  - Think-pair-share common misconceptions (e.g., 'more logs = better security').
  - Role-play a log-based incident response simulation.
  - 'Group challenge: Design an audit trail for compliance (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS).'

  - 'Use partial truths: e.g., correct concept but wrong context (debug vs production).'
  - 'Reference voter suggestions: Misconceptions like verbose logging = security.'
  - 'Ensure 3 distractors per MCQ: 1 plausible error, 1 opposite extreme, 1 irrelevant.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in university-level pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 25 high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards on ''Error Handling

  **Research Context (completed):** Effective error handling/logging provides visibility for incidents/troubleshooting. NIST
  SP 800-92 ''Guide to Computer Security Log Management'': Covers planning/operations (e.g., log generation with time sync,
  secure transmission; best practices: centralized storage, analysis via SIEM, retention/disposal). OWASP: Avoid error info
