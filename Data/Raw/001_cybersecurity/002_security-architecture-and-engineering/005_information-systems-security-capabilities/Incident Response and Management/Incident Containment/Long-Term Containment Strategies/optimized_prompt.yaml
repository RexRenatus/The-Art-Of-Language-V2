active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs between implementing Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) and traditional perimeter-based
    security for long-term containment. Which is more effective in a hybrid cloud environment, and why? Use NIST SP 800-207
    principles (e.g., explicit verification, least privilege, assume breach) to support your arguments. In groups of 4, assign
    pro/con positions and vote on the strongest case.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    2) Partial truth/overgeneralization (e.g., ''Perimeter security alone suffices''); 3) Confusable term (e.g., mix CP-2
    with CP-4). Base on research/voter input (e.g., incomplete NIST controls, ZTA vs. perimeter). Ensure 1 correct answer
    clearly superior.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  Long-Term Containment Strategies (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information Systems
  Security Capabilities > Incident Response and Management > Incident Containment > Long-Term Containment Strategies). Use
  provided research: Definitions (containment, resilience, defense-in-depth, ZTA, least privilege); NIST SP 800-207 (ZTA:
  never trust/always verify, limit lateral movement); NIST SP 800-53 (complete: CP-2/4/9 Contingency; AC-6 Least Privilege;
  SC-7 Boundary; SI-4 Monitoring; AU-6 Audit).
