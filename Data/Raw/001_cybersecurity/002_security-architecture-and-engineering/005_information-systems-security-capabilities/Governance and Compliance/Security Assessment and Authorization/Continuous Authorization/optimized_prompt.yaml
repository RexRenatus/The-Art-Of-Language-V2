active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a think-pair-share activity, debate the trade-offs between traditional periodic authorization and
    continuous authorization in terms of cost, agility, and security effectiveness, using NIST RMF as reference. Address misconceptions
    like equating continuous monitoring with zero risk.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - D1: Common misconception (e.g., confuse CM with OA, or periodic ATO with CA).

    - D2: Partial truth or outdated concept (e.g., reference RMF Step 4 instead of 5/6).

    - D3: Extreme or irrelevant option (e.g., ''eliminates all risk'' or non-NIST standard).

    Ensure distractors are realistic based on voter-noted confusions (CM vs OA, periodic vs continuous).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  Continuous Authorization (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information Systems Security
  Capabilities > Governance and Compliance > Security Assessment and Authorization > Continuous Authorization).


  **Research Context:** [Insert full research summary here, including definitions (CM, OA, RMF, AO), NIST SP 800-37 Rev 2
  (Appendix F: Ongoing Authorization), SP 800-53 Rev 5 CA-6 (ongoing authorization processes and monitoring), shift to dynamic
  environments (cloud, zero trust), sources: nist-sp-800-37-r2.bsafes.com, csrc.nist.rip/publications/nistpubs/800-37-rev1/nist_oa_guidance.pdf].


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Paste full array from above].

  - Active Learning: [Paste discussion, peer teaching, problem-solving from above; reference in explanations].

  - Scaffolding: [Paste prior_knowledge, big_picture_context, all 4 layers].


  **Task:** Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards following the exact FLASHCARD_SCHEMA:

  [Paste full flashcard_schema from above].


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects, e.g., [{...}, {...}]. Ensure progression through Bloom''s levels and scaffolding
  layers. Use university-style rigor: precise NIST terminology, real-world examples (e.g., AWS Config, federal systems), address
  misconceptions. No additional text.'
