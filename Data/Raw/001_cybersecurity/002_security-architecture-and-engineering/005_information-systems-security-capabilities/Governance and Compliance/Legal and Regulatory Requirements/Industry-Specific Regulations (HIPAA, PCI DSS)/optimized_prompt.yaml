active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges of complying with both HIPAA and PCI DSS in a multi-service
    healthcare provider that also processes patient payments. Consider overlaps in controls (e.g., encryption), potential
    conflicts, and strategies for prioritization. Support arguments with real-world examples like the Target breach.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
