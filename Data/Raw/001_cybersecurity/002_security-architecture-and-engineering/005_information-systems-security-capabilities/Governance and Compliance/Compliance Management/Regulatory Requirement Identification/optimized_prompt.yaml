active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: For a healthcare provider operating in the US and EU, compare and contrast how NIST CSF 2.0 and ISO 27001
    guide regulatory requirement identification for data protection. Debate which framework better addresses HIPAA and GDPR
    overlaps, considering resource constraints.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions: 1) Outdated info (e.g., NIST
    CSF 1.1 functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover missing Govern). 2) Framework confusion (e.g., mix ISO
    27001 certification with NIST flexibility). 3) Partial truths (e.g., HITRUST categories omitting key ones like Privacy
    Management). Ensure distractors are realistic from voter/research context.'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:\
  \ Regulatory Requirement Identification (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Information\
  \ Systems Security Capabilities > Governance and Compliance > Compliance Management > Regulatory Requirement Identification).\
  \ Use the provided learning objectives, active learning activities, scaffolding layers, and flashcard schema to create optimized\
  \ Anki-style flashcards.\n\nIncorporate university pedagogy: Progress through Bloom's Taxonomy, active learning (e.g., inspire\
  \ discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving), scaffolding from foundation to integration. Ensure completeness: Full NIST\
  \ CSF 2.0 functions (Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover), ISO 27001/27002, HITRUST CSF 14 categories (Information\
  \ Security Management Program, Access Control, etc.). Prior knowledge: Builds on governance basics.\n\nOutput ONLY a JSON\
  \ array of 25 flashcards, each matching the schema:\n{\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"type\": \"Multiple Choice|Definition|Application\
  \ Scenario\",\n  \"front\": \"Question text\",\n  \"back\": {\n    \"answer\": \"...\",\n    \"explanation\": \"...\",\n\

  \ Use distractor protocol for MCQs. Make explanations educational with sources."
