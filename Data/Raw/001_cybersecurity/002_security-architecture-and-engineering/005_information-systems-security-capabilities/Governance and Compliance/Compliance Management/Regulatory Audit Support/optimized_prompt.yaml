active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between comprehensive continuous audit logging (per NIST
    AU-2) and resource-efficient periodic sampling for regulatory compliance. Use real-world examples from PCI-DSS or SOC
    2 audits to support your arguments, considering cost, privacy, and effectiveness.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Generate\
  \ 20 high-quality Anki-style flashcards on 'Regulatory Audit Support' using the EXACT topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security\
  \ Architecture And Engineering > Information Systems Security Capabilities > Governance and Compliance > Compliance Management\
  \ > Regulatory Audit Support.\n\nIncorporate:\n- Learning objectives: [paste full array from learning_objectives]\n- Active\
  \ learning elements: Tie cards to discussion/peer teaching/problems (e.g., scenario cards for problem-solving).\n- Scaffolding:\
  \ Distribute cards across 4 layers [paste scaffolding details]; label each with layer.\n- Prior knowledge: Assume basics\
  \ in Compliance Management/Risk Assessment.\n- Content: NIST SP 800-53r5 full controls (AU: Policy AU-1, Logging AU-2, Review\
  \ AU-6; AC, CA, SA: Policy SA-1, Acquisition SA-4/8; SC, SI), ISO 27001 A.12.4/A.16, SOC 2 CC6/CC7, PCI-DSS Req10. Concept\
  \ map: Regulatory Audit Support → NIST controls → Audit Trails → Risk Mgmt. Misconceptions: Audit trails only incidents;\
  \ checklists w/o evidence. Sources: NIST (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf), etc.\n\
