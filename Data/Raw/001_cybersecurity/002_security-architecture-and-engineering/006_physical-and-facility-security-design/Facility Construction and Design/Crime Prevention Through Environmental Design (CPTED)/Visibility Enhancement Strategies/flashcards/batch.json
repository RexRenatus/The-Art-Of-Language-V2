        "core_logic": "Territorial reinforcement works by using design elements like landscaping or low walls to clearly delineate public and private spaces, because this strategy fosters a sense of ownership and encourages legitimate users to monitor their perceived territory. This indirectly enhances visibility by making unauthorized presence more noticeable against the clearly defined boundaries.",
