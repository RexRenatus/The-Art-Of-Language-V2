active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a data center protecting critical cybersecurity assets, debate whether investing in advanced non-combustible
    materials (e.g., Type I construction per IBC) provides greater ROI than cyber-only defenses. Consider real-world fire
    incidents (e.g., data center outages) and cite standards like NFPA 220.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
