learning_objectives:
  remember:
  - objective: 'Recall the definition of fire resistance rating and its key criteria: integrity (no flame passage), insulation
      (limited temperature rise), and structural integrity.'
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  understand:
  - objective: Explain how fire severity, influenced by combustible contents, determines required fire resistance ratings.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  create:
  - objective: Design a fire-resistant assembly (e.g., wall or floor) for a cybersecurity-protected data center, justifying
      choices with NIST/IBC standards and performance-based optimizations.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  analyze:
  - objective: 'Compare NIST BMS92 construction types (Type I: Fireproof, Type II: Incombustible, Type III: Exterior-Protected,
      Type IV: Heavy Timber) with IBC classifications.'
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  evaluate:
  - objective: Assess a building design's compliance with fire resistance standards for a high-security facility like a data
      center, considering cost, combustibles, and physical security.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Select appropriate fire resistance ratings for structural elements (e.g., walls, floors, columns) based on
      building occupancy and IBC Table 601 requirements.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true

  **Topic Context:** Fire-resistant ratings ensure buildings (e.g., data centers) withstand fire to protect physical security
  in cybersecurity, preventing outages/breaches. Key from research: Fire resistance (integrity/insulation/structural); rating
  (hours per ASTM E119); severity (combustibles-driven); NIST BMS92 Types I-IV; IBC/ICC Types I-V (https://codes.iccsafe.org);
  firestopping.
