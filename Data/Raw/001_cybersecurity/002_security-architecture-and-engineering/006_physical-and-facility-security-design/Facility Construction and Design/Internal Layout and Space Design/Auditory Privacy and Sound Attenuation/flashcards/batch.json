        "core_logic": "Speech privacy levels are defined by the intelligibility of overheard speech. Normal privacy allows for some understanding but not full comprehension, suitable for many open office scenarios. Confidential privacy significantly reduces intelligibility, protecting more sensitive information, and often requires more robust acoustic treatments.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors misrepresent the definitions by focusing on sound intensity (muffled vs. nothing), specific solutions (partitions, masking), or rigid environmental associations.",
        "analogy": "Normal privacy is like being in a crowded cafe where you can hear snippets of conversations but can't follow any single one. Confidential privacy is like being in a soundproof booth where you can barely hear anything from outside."

        "core_logic": "Contemporary office design often favors lower partitions to foster collaboration and visual connection. 'Sound Matters' suggests that acoustic performance can be achieved through absorptive materials on these lower partitions and by strategically orienting workstations, rather than relying solely on height, because sound travels over and around partitions.",
