  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Delivery inspection procedures are more critical for
    physical threats (e.g., explosives) than cyber risks (e.g., malware insertion) in loading areas.'' Use NIST SP 800-161
    controls (SI-7, SI-20) and real-world examples like the SolarWinds supply chain attack to support your arguments, considering
    prerequisites from Personnel Security and Guard Operations.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  - 'Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., ''Skip visual checks if seal intact'' – ignores tampering post-seal).'
  - 'Distractor 2: Related but incorrect concept (e.g., confuse SI-7 with SI-20: ''SI-7 prioritizes risks'' – no, SI-20 does).'
  - 'Distractor 3: Extreme/overly simplistic (e.g., ''X-ray all packages'' – impractical; or ''Ignore physical threats'' –
    ignores subdomain).'
  - 'Ensure plausibility: Base on voter priorities (e.g., incomplete controls), real threats (counterfeit vs. genuine), Bloom
    progression.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² CISSP domains. Topic:
  Delivery Inspection Procedures (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Physical and Facility
  Security Design > Personnel Security and Guard Operations > Delivery and Loading Area Security > Delivery Inspection Procedures).
  Use the provided learning objectives, active learning components, scaffolding layers (complete with NIST SP 800-161 details:
  SI-7 full: a. Integrity tools; b. Prohibit changes; c. Scanning; SI-20: Risk assessment/prioritization; SA-12: Protection
  plans; SR-3/5/6: Controls/acquisition/supplier reviews), and flashcard schema.


  Prerequisites: Builds on guard protocols/physical security.


  Incorporate University pedagogy: Bloom''s progression, active recall, spaced repetition. Ensure completeness (cyber + physical
  threats), accuracy (NIST-aligned), scaffolding (Layer 1-4).
