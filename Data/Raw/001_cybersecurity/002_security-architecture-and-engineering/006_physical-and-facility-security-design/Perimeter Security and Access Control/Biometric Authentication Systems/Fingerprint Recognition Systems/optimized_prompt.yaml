active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of fingerprint recognition versus other biometrics (e.g.,
    iris or facial) for perimeter security in a corporate facility, considering factors like cost, accuracy (FAR/FRR), and
    environmental robustness.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

      FAR with FRR), 2) Related but incorrect term (e.g., ''bifurcation'' as minutiae type only), 3) Extreme value (e.g.,
      unrealistic error rate). Ensure distractors test deeper understanding.'
    quantity: 3-4 distractors per MCQ.

  Incorporate this comprehensive content:

  - Foundation: Definitions (fingerprint ridges/valleys, minutiae=endings/bifurcations, template=feature rep, FAR=false accept,
  FRR=false reject, FTE=% unable to enroll due to poor samples, FTA=capture fail).

  - Components: Sensors (optical, capacitive, ultrasonic); Algorithms (Crossing Number minutiae extraction); Flow: Capture>Enhance>Extract>Match.

  - Implementation: Enrollment (multi-samples, template build); Verification (1:1), ID (1:N); Best practices (hygiene, guidance).

  - Integration: Liveness (anti-spoof), standards (ISO/IEC 19794-2 minutiae format, NIST, FIDO), multi-modal, FAR/FRR trade-offs,
  vulns (fake prints).

  Sources: NIST Biometrics (nist.gov), ISO/IEC 19794-2, FIDO Alliance specs.
