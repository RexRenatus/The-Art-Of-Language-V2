active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of deploying PE-20 technologies (e.g., RFID vs. GPS) in terms of security benefits
    versus privacy risks, referencing federal laws and NIST privacy guidance. Consider scenarios involving employee-monitored
    assets like laptops.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    only).'

  **Core Content:** PE-20 requires organizations to employ asset location technologies (e.g., RFID, GPS, BLE beacons) to track
  defined assets (e.g., servers, laptops, vehicles) in controlled areas. Control statement: ''Organizations must employ specified
  asset location technologies...'' Comply with laws; privacy via General Counsel/SAOP. Related: CM-8, PE-16 (Delivery and
  Removal—monitor during transport), PE-3, MP-5. Big picture: NIST CSF Identify/Detect, physical risk mgmt, audits, IR. Prior:
  PE-1, CM-8.
