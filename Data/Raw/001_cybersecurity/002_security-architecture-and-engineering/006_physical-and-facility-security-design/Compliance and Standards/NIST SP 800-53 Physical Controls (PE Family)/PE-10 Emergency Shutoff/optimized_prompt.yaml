active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'Evaluate the trade-offs in placing emergency shutoff switches in a data center: near entrances for rapid
    access versus protected locations to prevent accidental activation. What factors (e.g., authorized personnel access, facility
    layout, risk assessment) influence the decision, and how does this align with NIST PE-10''s requirements for accessibility
    and protection? Discuss potential misconceptions, such as assuming ''quick access'' overrides safety protocols.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    all emergencies); ''Accessible to all staff'' (ignores authorized personnel); ''No protection needed for quick access''

  Generate high-quality, Anki-optimized flashcards for the topic ''PE-10 Emergency Shutoff'' (Category: Cybersecurity; Domain:
  Security Architecture And Engineering; Subdomain: Physical and Facility Security Design; Entry: Compliance and Standards
  > NIST SP 800-53 Physical Controls (PE Family)).


  **Topic Content (from NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5):** PE-10 mandates: (1) Capability to shut off power to systems/components in
  emergencies; (2) Accessible shutoff devices in designated areas for authorized personnel; (3) Protection from unauthorized/accidental
  activation. Supplemental: Critical for data centers/server rooms. Links to NIST CSF PR.IR-02.
