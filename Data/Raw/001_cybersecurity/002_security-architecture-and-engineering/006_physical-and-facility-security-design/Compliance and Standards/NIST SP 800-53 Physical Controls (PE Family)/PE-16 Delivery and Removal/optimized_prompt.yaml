  discussion_prompt: 'Evaluate the risks of unauthorized component removal in a remote work scenario (e.g., employee taking
    hardware home) and propose PE-16 compliant mitigations, such as enhanced logging and verification protocols. Discuss in
    groups: How does this integrate with cloud provider hardware intake processes?'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules: 'Generate 2-3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on: 1. Common misconceptions (e.g., confuse with PE-3 access
      control); 2. Related controls (e.g., PE-9 fire protection, MP-5 encryption); 3. Partial truths (e.g., ''cost tracking''
      vs. ''audit accountability''); 4. Real-world irrelevancies (e.g., ''software licensing''). Ensure one distractor is
      from another PE control.'
    examples:
    - 'Q: Primary objective of PE-16? A: Control components entering/exiting. Distractors: Protect from fire (PE-9), Encrypt
      media (MP-5), Employee access (PE-3).'
