active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare and contrast data overwriting methods (e.g., single-pass vs. multi-pass) with other sanitization
    techniques like cryptographic erase or physical destruction. Debate their suitability for different media types (HDD vs.
    SSD) based on NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 2, considering recoverability risks, cost-effectiveness, and real-world recoverability
    evidence.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Confuse HDD/SSD methods (e.g., multi-pass for SSDs).

    - Mix sanitization levels (Clear as Purge).

    - Legacy vs. modern standards (DoD 5220.22-M as NIST current).

    - Overstate effectiveness (single-pass = unrecoverable).

    - Include similar terms (wipe vs. erase) or irrelevant options (e.g., encryption without erase). Ensure 70% high-plausibility
    to test deep understanding.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² CISSP topics. Topic:
  Data Wiping and Overwriting Standards (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Physical and Facility
  Security Design > Asset Protection and Management > Secure Disposal and Sanitization > Data Wiping and Overwriting Standards).
  Use NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 2 as primary source (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/88/r2/ipd), supplemented by DoD 5220.22-M,
  IEEE 2883, NSA specs.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives [paste full list above].

  - Active learning elements: Weave in discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving prompts as example scenarios in explanations.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers [paste full layers above]; tag each.

  - Prior knowledge: CIA Triad, HDD/SSD differences, encryption basics.

  - Big picture: Secure disposal in asset protection, CISSP Domain 3, compliance (HIPAA/GDPR).


  Generate flashcards per exact schema [paste full schema above]. Ensure Bloom''s progression, active recall (MCQs test application/analysis),
  no spoilers on fronts. Output as markdown table or JSON array for easy import to Anki/Quizlet. Vary formats: 40% definition
  Q&A, 30% scenario application, 20% comparison/analysis, 10% policy design. Prioritize misconceptions (e.g., SSD overwriting
  myths).'
