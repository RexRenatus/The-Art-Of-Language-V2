active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a company with 1000 employees where 5 devices are lost per month on average, propose policy changes
    for reporting lost or stolen devices to minimize data breach risks. Debate the trade-offs between user convenience (e.g.,
    simple reporting apps) and security (e.g., mandatory remote wipes and CSIRT involvement).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Create plausible distractors based on common misconceptions: e.g., confuse CSIRT with ''IT support/HR/Facilities'';
    mix up ''remote wipe'' with ''remote lock''; overlook ''data at rest'' vs. ''data in transit''; reference outdated/wrong
    standards (e.g., ''NIST CSF Identify'' instead of ''Respond''). Ensure distractors are realistic errors from real-world
    scenarios.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  ''Lost or Stolen Device Reporting'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Physical and Facility
  Security Design > Mobile and Portable System Security > Mobile System Theft Prevention > Lost or Stolen Device Reporting).
  Use provided research: Core concepts (lost/stolen incident, CSIRT, data at rest, remote wipe, at-rest encryption, MFA);
  NIST SP 800-124 Rev. 2 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/124/r2/final) for mobile security guidelines; NIST CSF Respond/Recover
  integration.


  Incorporate pedagogy: Learning objectives [insert array above]; Active learning [discussion/peer/problem-solving for context];
  Scaffolding [4 layers above]; Prior knowledge: incident response, encryption, MDM.


  Generate flashcards using exact schema: [insert flashcard_schema structure]. Cover all Bloom''s levels/objectives evenly
  (4-6 cards each), all scaffolding layers (5-8 cards each). Ensure 82.9% voter-approved accuracy. Include 2-3 formative MCQs
  per layer with distractors. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {...}}]. No extra text.'
