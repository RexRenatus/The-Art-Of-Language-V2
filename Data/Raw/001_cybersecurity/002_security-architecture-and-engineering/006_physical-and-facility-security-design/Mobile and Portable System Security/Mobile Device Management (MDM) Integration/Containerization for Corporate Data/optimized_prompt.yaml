active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the security trade-offs of using containerization for corporate data versus
    traditional VM-based isolation. Consider factors like resource efficiency, shared kernel risks, and compliance requirements
    from NIST SP 800-190. Support arguments with real-world examples from breaches like the 2021 Codecov supply chain attack.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 3 plausible distractors per card, based on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Containers use hypervisors like VMs' for VM
      confusion).
    - 'Distractor 1: Overly simplistic or outdated (e.g., ignore shared kernel risks).'
    - 'Distractor 2: Related but wrong concept (e.g., confuse runtime with orchestration).'
    - 'Distractor 3: Extreme or implausible (e.g., ''Containers eliminate all attack surfaces'').'
    - Ensure no correct answer hints; balance difficulty.
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in containerization security.\
  \ Use university pedagogy: Bloom's Taxonomy, active learning ties, scaffolding. Topic: 'Containerization for Corporate Data'.\n\
  \n**Corrected Topic Hierarchy** (addressing misalignment; containerization is OS-level virtualization, not physical/MDM\
  \ primary):\n- Level 1: Cybersecurity\n- Level 2: Security Architecture And Engineering\n- Level 3: Virtualization and Container\
  \ Security\n- Level 4: Container Runtime Security\n- Level 5: Secure Container Images and Registries\n- Level 6: Containerization\
  \ for Corporate Data\n\n**Completed Research Context**:\nContainerization packages apps/dependencies into isolated containers\
  \ sharing host kernel (lighter than VMs). Key risks to corporate data: supply chain (images), privilege escalation (runtime),\
  \ orchestration misconfigs.\nCore Concepts: Container image (static template), runtime (Docker/containerd), orchestration\
  \ (Kubernetes), attack surface (build/ship/run phases).\nStandards:\n- NIST SP 800-190: Controls for images (scanning/signing),\
  \ runtime (isolation), orchestration (RBAC/network policies).\n- NIST SP 800-53 Rev5: SC-39 (isolation), CM-8 (inventory),\
  \ SA-8 (principles).\nBest Practices: Minimal images, vulnerability scanning (Trivy), signing (cosign), runtime monitoring\
  \ (Falco), secrets (Vault), CIS Benchmarks.\nMobile Tie-in: Analogous to MDM sandboxing (Android Work Profiles, iOS Managed\
  \ Apps) for corporate data isolation.\nSources: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-190.pdf,\
