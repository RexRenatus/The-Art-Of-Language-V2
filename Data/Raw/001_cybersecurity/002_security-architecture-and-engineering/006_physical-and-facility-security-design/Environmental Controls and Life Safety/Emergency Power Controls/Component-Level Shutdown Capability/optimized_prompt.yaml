active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of component-level shutdown versus full-system shutdown (e.g., EPO buttons) in
    an OT cyber incident affecting emergency power controls. Consider impacts on cyber resilience (per NIST SP 800-160v2r1),
    operational downtime, and recovery time, using real-world examples from critical infrastructure like data centers.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For multiple_choice (4 options: 1 correct, 3 distractors): Distractors must be plausible based on
    common misconceptions (e.g., ''Full system shutdown'' as distractor for component-level); partial truths (e.g., ''Only
    software-based''); or unrelated terms (e.g., ''Encryption''). Ensure 1-2 stem from voter-noted trade-offs or prior knowledge
    (e.g., EPO confusion). No ''all/none'' options.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert cybersecurity educator and flashcard generator, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Generate
  30 high-quality, spaced-repetition-optimized flashcards for the topic ''Component-Level Shutdown Capability'' (Category:
  Cybersecurity; Domain: Security Architecture And Engineering; Subdomain: Physical and Facility Security Design; Entry: Environmental
  Controls and Life Safety → Emergency Power Controls; Hierarchy: Level 1-6 as specified).


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM JSON].

  - Scaffolding Layers: Use provided content [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING FROM JSON] as core material; ensure 7-8 cards per layer,
  progressing from simple recall to complex application.

  - Active Learning: Embed prompts/examples (e.g., cards with debate trade-offs or protocol design questions).

  - Research Context: NIST SP 800-160v2r1 (cyber resilience), SP 800-82r3 (ICS/least functionality), SP 800-161 Rev. 1 (supply
  chain: practices for isolating compromised components in systems engineering).

  Best Practices: Varied types (40% MCQ, 30% short answer, 30% cloze); active recall; atomic facts; cover all Bloom''s levels/objectives
  evenly; misconceptions from full-system shutdown confusion.


  Strictly follow Flashcard Schema [INSERT FULL SCHEMA FROM JSON]. Output ONLY a JSON array of 30 flashcards: [{''type'':
