active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In the context of physical security for cybersecurity facilities (e.g., data centers), debate the priority
    of chemical spill containment versus other environmental threats like fire suppression or flooding. Justify your position
    using CISSP Domain 3 principles, OSHA standards, and real-world examples such as UPS battery acid spills.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on:

    - Common misconceptions (e.g., ''Evacuate first before assessing'' vs. correct ''Assess safely first'').

    - Partial truths (e.g., correct step out of sequence).

    - Irrelevant but similar concepts (e.g., fire response instead of spill).

    - Voter-noted errors (e.g., ignoring IT-specific hazards like server damage).

    Ensure distractors test critical thinking without being obviously wrong.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for university-level pedagogy, specializing in CISSP-aligned physical
  security topics. Topic: ''Chemical Spill Containment'' in the context of Physical and Facility Security Design for cybersecurity
  facilities (e.g., data centers with UPS battery acids, chemical fire suppressants). This aligns with CISSP Domain 3 (Security
  Architecture and Engineering), Environmental Controls and Life Safety, despite general physical safety roots—focus on protecting
  IT infrastructure per NIST SP 800-53, OSHA 1910.120, NFPA 75/76.
