active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a tornado-prone region like Tornado Alley, debate whether organizations should prioritize on-site
    reinforcements (e.g., FEMA P-361 safe rooms) or off-site georedundancy for critical infrastructure. Support your position
    with NIST CSF Protect and Recover functions, considering cost, recovery time, and cybersecurity resilience.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    based on common misconceptions: e.g., confuse NIST Protect with Recover; mix FEMA P-361 with unrelated standards; use
    real terms but wrong context (e.g., ''flood barriers'' for tornadoes). Ensure distractors teach by contrast. No ''all/none''
    options.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for university-level cybersecurity education on ''Tornado and Severe
  Weather Safeguards'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Physical and Facility Security
  Design > Environmental Controls and Life Safety > Environmental Threat Protection > Tornado and Severe Weather Safeguards).


  Incorporate this synthesized content:

  - Core Concepts: Severe/extreme weather (CISA), critical infrastructure/resilience (NIST), tornado impacts on facilities.

  - NIST CSF Applications: Identify (risk mapping), Protect (FEMA P-361 safe rooms, reinforced structures), Detect (monitoring),
  Respond (protocols), Recover (BCP/DRP, georedundancy).

  - Best Practices: Site selection, redundant power, climate modeling.

  - Voter Priorities: SMART objectives, 4-layer scaffolding, prior knowledge links.
