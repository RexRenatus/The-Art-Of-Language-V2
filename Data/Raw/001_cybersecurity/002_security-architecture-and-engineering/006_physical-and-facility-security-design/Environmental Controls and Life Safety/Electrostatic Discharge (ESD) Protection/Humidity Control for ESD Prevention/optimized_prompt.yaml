active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the role of humidity control as a primary versus supplementary ESD prevention
    method. Address common misconceptions (e.g., 'higher RH always prevents ESD' or 'humidity replaces grounding') and evaluate
    limitations like condensation risks at RH >60%. Use ANSI/ESD S20.20 standards to support arguments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    value (e.g., 10% RH safe), (3) Confused term (e.g., absolute vs. relative humidity). Base on voter priorities, research
    (e.g., dry air risks), non-examples (condensation). Ensure distractors teach via correction.'

  Generate 50 high-quality flashcards optimized for Anki/Quizlet using university pedagogy: Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning,
  scaffolding.


  **Incorporate these exactly:**

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the array above]

  - Scaffolding Layers: [paste the scaffolding object above]

  - Active Learning: [reference for tie-ins]

  - Concept Map: Central ''Humidity Control for ESD'' → Branches: Role in Dissipation (RH conductivity), Standards (ANSI/ESD
  S20.20: RH 30-50%, program specs when needed), Limitations (condensation, not standalone), Related Controls (grounding/ionization),
  Hierarchy links.

  - Prior Knowledge: Static electricity, triboelectric charging.

  - Misconceptions: Humidity as primary control; high RH always safe.

  - Research: ESD definition, RH role in dissipation, EPA requirements, truncated studies on limits; complete standards per
  ANSI/ESD S20.20 (humidity monitoring in programs).
