active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss how combustible material storage policies intersect with the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
    Availability) in physical security. Provide examples of how a fire event could impact each principle and propose mitigation
    strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    principles:
    - Common misconceptions (e.g., 'combustible' vs. 'flammable').
    - Partial truths (e.g., correct for NFPA but wrong for CFR).
    - Irrelevant details (e.g., 40 CFR Part 60 emissions – noted as low relevance).
    - Extremes (e.g., 'no exceptions ever' vs. sprinkler allowances).
    - Similar standards (e.g., mix NFPA 75 with 76 requirements).
    count: Always 3 distractors for MCQs, plausible and educationally valuable.

  Research Context (complete/expanded per voter priorities):

  - Core: 36 CFR Part 1234 (NARA): Non-combustible materials for records storage; fire barriers (2-hr rating); sprinklers
  allow roof exceptions. https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-36/chapter-XII/subchapter-B/part-1234

  - NFPA 75 (IT Equipment Fire Protection): Combustible separation, suppression. https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=75

  - NFPA 76 (Telecom): Similar for facilities. https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=76

  - Note: 40 CFR Part 60 Subpart BBBB (emissions from combustors) low relevance – focus on storage, not emissions.

  - Sources: Above + OSHA 1910.106 (flammables), FM Global Data Center guidelines.
