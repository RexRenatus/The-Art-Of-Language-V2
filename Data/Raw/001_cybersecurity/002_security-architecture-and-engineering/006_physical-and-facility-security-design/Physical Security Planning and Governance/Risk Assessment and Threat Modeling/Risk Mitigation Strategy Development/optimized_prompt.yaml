  Development).


  Use this COMPLETE research context:

  ## Risk Mitigation Strategy Development

  Core Concepts: Cybersecurity Risk (loss from incidents); Risk Management (identify/assess/treat); Risk Mitigation (reduce
  likelihood/impact); Treatment Options (mitigate, accept, avoid, transfer); NIST CSF 2.0 (Govern: oversee strategy/policies;
  Identify: assess risks/assets; Protect: safeguards e.g., locks/perimeter; Detect: monitor anomalies e.g., CCTV/IDS; Respond:
  contain/incident response; Recover: restore/improve). ERM: holistic risks. Physical examples: Tailgating (Protect: mantraps);
  Floods (Mitigate: elevations/transfer: insurance).
