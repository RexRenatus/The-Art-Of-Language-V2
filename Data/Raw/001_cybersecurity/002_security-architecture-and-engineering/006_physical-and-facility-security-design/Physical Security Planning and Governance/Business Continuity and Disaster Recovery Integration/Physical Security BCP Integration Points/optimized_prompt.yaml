active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the integration challenges of NIST PE-13 (Fire Protection) and PE-11 (Emergency Power) in a
    BCP for a high-rise office building during a hurricane. What trade-offs exist between stringent physical security measures
    and rapid operational recovery (e.g., RTO/RPO), and how would you prioritize them? Support your position with evidence
    from NIST SP 800-53 and real-world data like Verizon DBIR (40% of breaches involve physical access).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MC card: 1) Similar NIST control (e.g., PE-13 for fire instead
    of PE-11 power), 2) Common misconception (e.g., digital control like AC-2), 3) Non-relevant PE control or BCP phase mismatch.
    Ensure distractors test subtle differences (e.g., prevention vs. recovery focus). Base on real errors from standards or
    DBIR.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in CISSP Domain 3: Security
  Architecture and Engineering. Topic: Physical Security BCP Integration Points (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture
  And Engineering > Physical and Facility Security Design > Physical Security Planning and Governance > Business Continuity
  and Disaster Recovery Integration > Physical Security BCP Integration Points).


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards using the exact schema: Each card as JSON object with ''front'' (question), ''back''
  { ''answer'', ''explanation'', ''bloom_level'', ''scaffolding_layer'', ''active_link'' (optional) }.


  Incorporate:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the 6 objectives above]

  - Scaffolding: Balance 5-7 cards per layer [paste scaffolding details].

  - Active Learning: Tie 20% cards to activities (e.g., ''Link to discussion: hurricane trade-offs'').

  - Content: NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 PE controls (PE-2, PE-3, PE-11, PE-13, PE-14+), BCP phases, examples (high-rise hurricane,
  manufacturing flood), prior knowledge (RTO/RPO, access control), big picture (defense-in-depth, DBIR stats). Sources: NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf.


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly [paste schema details]. Ensure progression: lower Bloom''s in early layers, higher in later.
  Output ONLY a JSON array of 25 flashcards.'
