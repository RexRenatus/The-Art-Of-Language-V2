active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the ethical and legal considerations of conducting physical penetration
    tests (e.g., tailgating simulations) versus red team exercises in a real facility. How do these practices build on prior
    knowledge of physical security controls like access badges and CCTV? Support your arguments with NIST SP 800-115 phases.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
