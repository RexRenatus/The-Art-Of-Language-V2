active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of manual vs. automated incident detection in physical security
    monitoring (e.g., human-monitored CCTV vs. AI-driven anomaly detection). Use NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 phases to argue which
    approach better supports rapid response in scenarios like tailgating intrusions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - 'Plausible but incorrect: Common misconceptions (e.g., confuse Detection with Containment).'
    - 'Physically relevant: Tailor to subdomain (e.g., distractor: ''Manual guard patrol only'' vs. automated SIEM).'
    - 'Progressive difficulty: Layer 1 = simple errors; Layer 4 = subtle standard misalignments.'
    - 'Avoid randomness: Base on voter-noted errors (e.g., cyber-only focus) or research (e.g., outdated Rev. 2 phases).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Security Architecture and
  Engineering. Topic: ''Incident Detection and Response Workflows'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And
  Engineering > Physical and Facility Security Design > Surveillance and Monitoring Systems > Physical Security Monitoring
  > Incident Detection and Response Workflows).


  Incorporate voter consensus (54.3% approval): Emphasize physical security (CCTV intrusions, alarms) over cyber-only; complete
  NIST CSF 2.0 details; use NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 phases; standards like ASIS/IEC 60839.


  Research context: Events (observable occurrences); Incidents (jeopardize CIA triad, e.g., physical breaches); IR Workflow
  (people/processes/tech per NIST).


  Pedagogy: Align to Bloom''s (REMEMBER to CREATE). Scaffolding: 4 layers (Foundation: defs; Components: frameworks; Implementation:
  phases; Integration: CSF/automation). Active learning: Tie flashcards to discussions (e.g., manual vs auto), peer teaching
  (phases), problem-solving (scenarios).
