By dividing a facility into zones (e.g., perimeter, movement areas, restricted zones), security lighting can be tailored to the specific risks and requirements of each area. This allows for more effective deterrence, detection, and response, as critical areas receive more robust lighting and surveillance than less sensitive ones, optimizing resource allocation for security.",
