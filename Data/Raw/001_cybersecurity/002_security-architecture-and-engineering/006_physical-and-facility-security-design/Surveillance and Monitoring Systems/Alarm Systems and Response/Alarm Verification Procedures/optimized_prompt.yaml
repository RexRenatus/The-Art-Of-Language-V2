active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Discuss the trade-offs between thorough alarm verification and rapid response in a critical infrastructure
    facility like a data center. What strategies can minimize false positives without increasing false negatives? Consider
    risk management, resource allocation, and compliance with standards like NIST SP 800-160.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse false/true positive, skip verification
      steps, ignore standards).
    - 'Distractor 1: Superficially similar but incorrect (e.g., ''Immediate response without check'' for verification step).'
    - 'Distractor 2: Extreme/opposite (e.g., ''Ignore all alarms as false positives'').'
    - 'Distractor 3: Partial truth/misapplication (e.g., ''CCTV only, no multi-sensor'').'
    - Ensure distractors promote critical thinking and error identification.
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Generate\
  \ high-quality, Anki-optimized flashcards for the topic: **Alarm Verification Procedures** (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security\
  \ Architecture And Engineering > Physical and Facility Security Design > Surveillance and Monitoring Systems > Alarm Systems\
  \ and Response > Alarm Verification Procedures).\n\n**Research Context:** Alarm verification confirms alarm legitimacy to\
  \ reduce false positives. Core concepts: Alarm (security alert), Verification (analysis of context/data), False Positive\
  \ (non-threat), True Positive (genuine threat). Standards: NIST SP 800-160 Vol. 1 (systems security engineering, risk-based\
  \ verification); UL 2050 (national industrial security systems); EN 50131 (alarm systems). Best practices: Step-by-step\
  \ (receive/prioritize, CCTV/log review, multi-sensor, escalate); AI/SIEM integration; SLAs (e.g., 60s verification). Misconceptions:\
  \ All alarms urgent; no verification needed. Sources: NIST SP 800-160r1 (full: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-160v1r1.pdf),\
