      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "The principle of least privilege dictates that access should be restricted to only what is necessary. Manually locking the screen when leaving a workstation ensures that access to the active session and its privileges is temporarily revoked, aligning with this principle by minimizing the window of unauthorized access.",
        "distractor_analysis": "While MFA, strong passwords, and patching are crucial security measures, they address different aspects of security. Screen locking directly enforces the principle of least privilege by restricting access to an active session when the authorized user is absent.",
        "analogy": "Requiring a manual screen lock is like a security guard checking your ID at a door; it ensures only the authorized person (you, when present) has access to the sensitive area (your active session), upholding the principle of least privilege."
