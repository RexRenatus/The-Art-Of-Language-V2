      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "NIST SP 800-63B recommends a maximum inactivity timeout of 1 hour for AAL2 sessions because it balances usability with the need for high confidence in authentication, requiring more frequent re-verification than AAL1 but less than the stringent requirements of AAL3.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors represent timeouts for AAL1 and AAL3, targeting common confusion between session timeout requirements across different assurance levels.",
        "analogy": "Think of AAL2 session timeouts like a security checkpoint that requires re-verification after an hour of inactivity, ensuring continuous authorization for sensitive areas."
