active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Related-key attacks are irrelevant in modern cryptography
    due to secure key management practices like those in NIST SP 800-57.'' Use examples from Skipjack and AES to support your
    position, addressing common misconceptions such as confusing related-key with known-key attacks.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
