active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the vulnerability of hardware AES implementations to correlation power
    analysis (CPA). How does Pearson correlation on Hamming weight leakage reveal key bytes? What countermeasures (e.g., masking)
    mitigate this, and are they foolproof? Support with statistical significance concepts.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse Pearson with covariance), 2)
    Similar concept (e.g., Spearman for linear case), 3) Edge case/error (e.g., p-value >0.05 as ''significant''). Ensure
    distractors test nuance in crypto apps (e.g., non-linear bias). For non-MCQ, suggest common wrong paths.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  Statistical Correlation Methods (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cryptanalytic Attacks
  > Classical Cryptanalytic Attacks > Statistical Cryptanalysis > Statistical Correlation Methods). Focus exclusively on cryptanalysis
  applications: correlation power analysis (CPA) with Pearson on power traces, correlation attacks on LFSR/stream ciphers/keystreams,
  linear approximations; avoid general security events.
