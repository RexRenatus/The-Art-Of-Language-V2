  discussion_prompt: 'Compare IC values for English plaintext (~0.066), monoalphabetic ciphertext (similar), polyalphabetic
    ciphertext (closer to random ~0.038), and fully random text. Debate why IC reveals cipher type and its limitations against
    modern ciphers like AES. Consider: What IC would repeated text like your name have, and how might adversaries exploit
    this?'
  peer_teaching: In pairs, Student A explains the IC formula derivation (∑f_i*(f_i-1) / N*(N-1)) and coincidence counting
    using a short plaintext example; Student B teaches back with quiz questions on expected values. Switch roles to address
    misconceptions like confusing IC with direct key length estimation.
  problem_solving: 'Provide sample ciphertexts (monoalphabetic substitution, Vigenère polyalphabetic, random). In groups,
    compute IC, classify the cipher type, and propose next attack steps (e.g., frequency analysis for monoalphabetic, Kasiski
    for polyalphabetic). Apply to real-world: Simulate analyzing encrypted malware payloads or CTF challenges using Excel/Python
    snippets.'

  Generate a set of 40-50 high-quality, optimized flashcards using the exact schema provided. Incorporate university pedagogy:
  Bloom''s Taxonomy objectives [insert learning_objectives array here], active learning activities [insert active_learning
  object here for inspiration], and 4 scaffolding layers [insert scaffolding array here].


  Key content from research/voters: IC formula = ∑[f_i*(f_i-1)] / [N*(N-1)]; English IC≈0.0667, monoalphabetic similar, polyalphabetic≈0.04-0.05,
  random uniform=0.0385 (1/26). Distinguish ciphers, Vigenère key length via substring IC. Examples: Step-by-step calcs, Python/Excel
  snippets. Limitations: Short texts unreliable, useless vs. AES.


  Output ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards: [{''front'': ''Question text'', ''back'': ''Answer | Explanation with objective/layer
  link | Example if applicable'', ''bloom_level'': ''REMEMBER'', ''layer'': 1, ''type'': ''cloze/mc/sa''}]. Strictly follow
  flashcard_schema: balance levels/types, distractor protocol for MCQs, explanations <100 words. Ensure active/scaffolded
  progression: lower layers for remember, higher for create. No extra text.'
