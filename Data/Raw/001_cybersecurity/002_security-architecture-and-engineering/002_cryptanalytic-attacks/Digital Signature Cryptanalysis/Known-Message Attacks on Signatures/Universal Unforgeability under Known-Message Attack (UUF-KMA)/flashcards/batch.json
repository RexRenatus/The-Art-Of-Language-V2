        "core_logic": "In security architecture, UUF-KMA provides a high level of assurance. It means that the integrity and authenticity of signed data are strongly protected against forgery attempts, even by sophisticated adversaries who have observed valid signatures. This reliability is crucial for applications requiring high trust, such as financial transactions or secure software distribution.",
        "distractor_analysis": "UUF-KMA does not directly impact data transmission speed. It does not eliminate the need for PKI, which manages public keys. Signature size is an efficiency metric, not a direct consequence of UUF-KMA.",
        "analogy": "A universally unforgeable signature scheme is like a gold standard for authenticity. It means you can trust the signature implicitly, knowing it's virtually impossible to fake, which builds confidence in the entire system."
