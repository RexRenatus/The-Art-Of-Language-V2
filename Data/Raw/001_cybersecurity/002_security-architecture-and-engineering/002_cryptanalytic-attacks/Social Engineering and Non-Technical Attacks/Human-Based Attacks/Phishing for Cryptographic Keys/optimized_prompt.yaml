active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the relative risks of phishing for cryptographic keys versus traditional cryptanalytic attacks
    like side-channel attacks, using real-world examples such as the SolarWinds breach or crypto wallet phishing campaigns
    (e.g., Ronin Network hack).
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains the key management lifecycle stages vulnerable to phishing (generation, distribution,
    storage, use, destruction), while the partner summarizes and provides a phishing example for each stage.
  problem_solving: Teams analyze a simulated phishing email targeting SSH keys; identify attack vectors, extract the malicious
    payload, and design multi-factor mitigations with cost-benefit analysis.

  **Topic Context:**

  - Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Social Engineering and Non-Technical Attacks (primary;
  note: reclassified from Cryptanalytic Attacks as it''s human-based, not mathematical) > Human-Based Attacks > Phishing for
  Cryptographic Keys.

  - Big Picture: Non-technical threats to crypto infrastructure; key compromise nullifies encryption. Real-world: Ronin Network
  hack via social engineering.

  - Prerequisites: Basic cryptographic keys (symmetric/asymmetric), phishing/social engineering.


  **Research Context (Completed):**

  Phishing tricks users into revealing keys via impersonation. Targets key lifecycle (NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 Rev. 5: secure
  generation, distribution, storage, use, destruction; phishing exploits human errors in each). Methods: fake login pages,
  malware-laden emails, fake support requests. Mitigations: MFA, HSMs, training. Sources: NIST SP 800-57pt1r5 (https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r5),
  OWASP Phishing (https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Phishing), Krebs on Security crypto phishing reports, Ronin hack
  postmortem (https://roninchain.com/blog-post/ronin-network-security-breach).
