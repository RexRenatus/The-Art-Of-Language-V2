active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate whether partition cryptanalysis poses a significant threat to lightweight stream ciphers used
    in IoT devices today, given modern key sizes and hardware constraints. Support your position with calculations of data
    and time complexity for a realistic attack scenario, and reference historical examples like attacks on the E0 cipher.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per card based on:

    - Common misconceptions (e.g., ''It''s a quantum algorithm using Grover''s for AES key search'' instead of classical keystream
    partitioning).

    - Confusion with similar attacks (e.g., linear cryptanalysis bias vs. partition conditional probability; differential
    vs. structural).

    - Calculation errors (e.g., wrong exponent in complexity: 2^{64} vs. sqrt(2^{64})).

    - Historical mixes (e.g., attributing to Biham hash attacks vs. O''Connor stream ciphers).

    Ensure distractors are plausible to educated learners but incorrect.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, focusing on university-level
  pedagogy (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate high-quality Anki-compatible flashcards for the topic
  ''Partition Cryptanalysis'' (classical cryptanalytic attack on stream ciphers by Laurence O''Connor 1995; Category: Cybersecurity
  > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cryptanalytic Attacks > Mathematical Cryptanalysis > Structural and Combinatorial
  Attacks > Partition Cryptanalysis). STRICTLY adhere to classical definition: keystream partitioning into subsets exploiting
  conditional probabilities for key recovery. AVOID quantum content (no Grover''s, Toffoli, AES quantum key search) unless
  contrasting as misconception.
