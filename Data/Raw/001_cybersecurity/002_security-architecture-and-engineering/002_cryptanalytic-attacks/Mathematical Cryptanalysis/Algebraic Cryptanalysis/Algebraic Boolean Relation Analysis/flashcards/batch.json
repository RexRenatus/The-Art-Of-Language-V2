        "core_logic": "The Security Design Order of Precedence (SecDOP) is a design approach that prioritizes loss prevention strategies, because eliminating loss potential through design selection is the most effective and cost-efficient method. This works by establishing a hierarchy: first, eliminate susceptibility, hazard, and vulnerability; if not possible, reduce them through design alteration; then, control them with engineered features; and finally, provide visibility and feedback. NIST SP 800-160v1r1 advocates this structured approach for building trustworthy secure systems.",
        "distractor_analysis": "The distractors misrepresent SecDOP as patch management, a control counting method, or a risk assessment framework, failing to capture its essence as a prioritized design strategy for minimizing loss potential.",
        "analogy": "SecDOP is like planning a trip: first, choose a route that avoids dangerous areas entirely (elimination); if not possible, take a safer, slightly longer route (reduction); if still risky, use safety features like airbags (control); and finally, have emergency contacts (visibility/feedback)."
