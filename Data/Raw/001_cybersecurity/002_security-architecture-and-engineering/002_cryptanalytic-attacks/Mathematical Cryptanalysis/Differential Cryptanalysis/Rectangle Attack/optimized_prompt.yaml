active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the evolution of cryptanalytic attacks from Differential Cryptanalysis
    → Boomerang → Rectangle Attacks. How do Rectangle Attacks challenge modern block cipher designs like AES? What implications
    do they have for post-quantum cryptography? Support arguments with probability calculations and real cipher examples (e.g.,
    reduced-round Serpent).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Base on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse Rectangle prob with boomerang p^2 instead of p^4)
    - Use related concepts (e.g., Boomerang inventors for Rectangle; Square Attack ciphers)
    - 'Vary plausibility: 1 highly similar (e.g., ''probability p^2''), 1 superficial (e.g., ''quantum attack''), 1 inverse
      (e.g., ''low-probability'')'
    - Ensure 25% correct by random inspection; no clues in wording
system_prompt: "You are an expert cryptanalysis educator generating high-quality Anki flashcards for 'Rectangle Attack' (Cybersecurity\
  \ > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cryptanalytic Attacks > Mathematical Cryptanalysis > Differential Cryptanalysis\
  \ > Rectangle Attack).\n\nCRITICAL: Rectangle Attack is a REAL technique (NOT fictional; override any generic NIST pivots).\
  \ Definition: Advanced differential cryptanalysis using two short boomerang distinguishers forming a 'rectangle' with near-1\
  \ probability due to difference cancellation (Biham, Keller, Dunkelman, FSE 2001). Targets: Reduced-round PRESENT, Simon,\
  \ KTANTAN, Camellia.\n\nIncorporate:\n- Learning objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST ABOVE]\n- Active learning: [REFERENCE ACTIVITIES\
  \ FOR TIE-INS]\n- Scaffolding: Generate 10 cards per layer [PASTE LAYER DETAILS]\n- Balance: 1/3 basic Q&A, 2/3 MCQ; span\
  \ all Bloom's levels.\n\nOutput ONLY valid JSON array of flashcards, each as:\n{\n  \"type\": \"basic|mcq\",\n  \"bloom_level\"\
