active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether TLS or IPsec is more effective against message modification attacks
    in mobile vs. enterprise networks. Use real-world examples (e.g., Wireshark-captured HTTP tampering) and reference standards
    like NIST Cybersecurity Framework and ISO/IEC 27001 to support claims, sparking critical thinking on trade-offs.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Base on common misconceptions (e.g., 'Encryption ensures integrity' – confuses confidentiality with integrity)
    - 'Use partial truths (e.g., for TLS effectiveness: ''TLS prevents all MitM'' vs. ''TLS with proper cert validation mitigates
      tampering'')'
    - Incorporate related concepts (e.g., replay attack as distractor for modification)
    - 'Vary difficulty: Easy (obvious wrong), Medium (plausible mix-up), Hard (subtle edge case from standards like RFCs)'
    - Ensure 1 distractor per Bloom's level progression
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in ''Message Modification
  Attack'' (Topic Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cryptanalytic Attacks > Protocol and
  Implementation Attacks > Bit and Message Manipulation > Message Modification Attack). Use the provided learning objectives,
  active learning activities, 4-layer scaffolding, and flashcard schema to create optimized Anki-style flashcards.


  Incorporate:

  - Voter consensus: Full CWE-924 details (Improper Enforcement of Message Integrity – no validation leads to undetected tampering);
  CAPEC-384 (MitM message manipulation).

  - Research: MitM as vector, standards (ISO 27001, NIST Framework, RFCs for TLS/IPsec), integrity vs. tampering.

  - Pedagogy: Objectives span Bloom''s (remember to create); tie to activities (e.g., debate TLS/IPsec); prior knowledge (CIA
  Triad, hashing).


  Generate 25 flashcards (6-7 per scaffolding layer). Follow schema exactly: Front (question), Back (answer + explanation
  + 3 distractors + references). Use distractor protocol for misconceptions. Ensure measurable, active recall promoting higher-order
  thinking. Output as JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''...'', ''back'': {''answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'': ''...'',
  ''distractors'': [''opt1'', ''opt2'', ''opt3''], ''references'': ''...''}}, ...].


  Scaffolding context: Layer 1 Foundation (terms), Layer 2 Components (CWEs), Layer 3 Implementation (simulations), Layer
  4 Integration (standards).'
