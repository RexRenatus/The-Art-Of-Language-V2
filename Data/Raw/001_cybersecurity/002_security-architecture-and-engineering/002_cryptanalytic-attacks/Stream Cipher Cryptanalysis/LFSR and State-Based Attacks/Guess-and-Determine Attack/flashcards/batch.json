        "core_logic": "Guess-and-Determine attacks exploit predictability and smaller search spaces. Increasing the internal state size expands the search space, making guessing harder. Ensuring a highly non-linear relationship between the state and the keystream obscures the connection, making it difficult to deduce state components from observed keystream, thus thwarting the 'Determine' phase.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors suggest using known weak components (LFSR), reducing security features (IV size), or introducing direct predictability, all of which would weaken, not enhance, security against this attack.",
        "analogy": "To make a secret code harder to guess, you'd use a longer secret word (larger state) and a more complex substitution cipher (non-linear output) rather than a simple, short code with a predictable pattern."
