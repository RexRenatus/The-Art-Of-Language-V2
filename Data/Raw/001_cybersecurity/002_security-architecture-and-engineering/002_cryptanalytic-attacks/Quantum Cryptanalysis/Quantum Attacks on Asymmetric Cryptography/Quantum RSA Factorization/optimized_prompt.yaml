    (e.g., confuses superposition with parallelism), 3) Plausible error (e.g., wrong complexity). Ensure distractors teach
    via explanation. Balance card types: 25% remember, 25% understand, 25% apply/analyze, 25% evaluate/create.'

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [paste the learning_objectives array here]

  - Active Learning: Use for inspiration in applied cards (e.g., debate risks in evaluation cards).

  - Scaffolding: Generate 5-8 cards per layer (Prior Knowledge + 4 layers), progressing from foundation to integration. Include
  prerequisites like classical RSA.

  - Research Context: RSA relies on factoring N=p*q; Shor''s (1994) uses superposition/QFT for polynomial-time factoring;
  NIST PQC (SP 800-56A/B Rev. 3, IR 8105) for migration; threats: Q-Day ~2030s, harvest-now attacks. Sources: Shor ''Polynomial-Time
  Algorithms for Prime Factorization'' (1994); NIST PQC Round 4 (ML-KEM etc.); IBM Quantum Roadmap.

  - Misconceptions: ''Quantum has broken RSA'' (no scalable qubits yet); ''Shor''s is classical'' (requires quantum).


  Follow Flashcard Schema exactly: Varied types, distractor protocol, explanations. Ensure university pedagogy: Bloom''s progression,
  active recall, spaced repetition.


  Generate 25-35 high-quality flashcards in the specified JSON output format. Cover all objectives, layers, and voter priorities
  (completeness, big picture). Make engaging, accurate, and misconception-proof.'
