        "core_logic": "Lattice reduction algorithms (LLL, BKZ) are fundamental tools for solving the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) and related problems in lattices. Since NTRU's security is based on the hardness of these lattice problems, efficient lattice reduction can break NTRU by finding short secret key vectors.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly link lattice reduction to symmetric encryption, hash collisions, or side-channel attacks, failing to recognize its direct application to breaking the core mathematical problem of NTRU.",
        "analogy": "Think of finding a secret key in NTRU as finding the shortest path in a complex maze (lattice). Lattice reduction algorithms are like advanced navigation tools that can find that shortest path much faster than random guessing."
