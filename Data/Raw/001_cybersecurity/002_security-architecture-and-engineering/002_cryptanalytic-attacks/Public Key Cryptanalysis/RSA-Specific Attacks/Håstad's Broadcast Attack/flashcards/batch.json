By choosing a sufficiently large public exponent 'e' (e.g., 65537), the value of m^e grows extremely rapidly. This makes m^e larger than the product of the moduli, even for relatively small messages, rendering the integer root extraction step computationally infeasible and thus preventing the attack.",
