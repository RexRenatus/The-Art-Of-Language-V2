        "core_logic": "Cryptographic protocols that provide both confidentiality and integrity are crucial because semi-active attacks target integrity. This works by using encryption to protect data and MACs to verify its unaltered state, forming a layered defense.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Strong passwords, firewall rules, and vulnerability scans address different security concerns and are less effective against attacks that modify legitimate, potentially encrypted, communication.",
        "analogy": "A defense-in-depth strategy against semi-active attacks is like building a fortress with multiple layers: strong walls (encryption), a vigilant guard at the gate (MACs), and internal checkpoints (segmentation)."
