  discussion_prompt: 'Compare semi-active attacks to passive and fully active attacks using MITRE ATT&CK techniques (e.g.,
    Collection for subtle probes vs. Impact for disruption). Debate: Is plausible deniability the key differentiator, and
    how should defenses adapt to blurring lines between attack types? Use examples like Heartbleed (semi-active probing) to
    challenge misconceptions.'
  peer_teaching: Pair students; Partner A explains a semi-active attack (e.g., subtle data injection in MITM exploiting trust
    relationships) with a hand-drawn diagram. Partner B teaches it back using a non-example (passive eavesdropping), references
    a MITRE ATT&CK technique (e.g., T1056 Input Capture with modification), and quizzes Partner A. Switch roles to reinforce
    understanding.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: An adversary intercepts IoT device communications, injecting minor forged commands that blend
    with legitimate traffic without disrupting service. In small groups: 1) Classify as semi-active; 2) Analyze risks using
    CWE-74 (Injection) and MITRE ATT&CK (e.g., T1557 Adversary-in-the-Middle); 3) Design 3 mitigations (e.g., message authentication,
    behavioral anomaly detection, traffic whitelisting); 4) Prototype a defense flowchart.'

    (e.g., passive-only). Ensure plausible based on research (e.g., confuse with Heartbleed as passive). Explanation must

  **Core Content Summary (Web-Researched, Voter-Completed):** Semi-active attack: Sophisticated interaction beyond passive
  (eavesdropping) but less than active (full compromise). Characteristics: data interception/injection/modification, limited
  control, plausible deniability, trust exploitation. Examples: Heartbleed (subtle probing), MITM selective forgery, IoT command
  injection blending with legit traffic. Frameworks: MITRE ATT&CK (TA0009 Collection, T1071 App Layer Protocol, T1557 MITM);
  CWE-74 (Injection), CWE-200 (Info Exposure). Mitigations: anomaly detection, integrity checks (HMAC), zero-trust, protocol
  hardening. Sources: attack.mitre.org, cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/74.html.
