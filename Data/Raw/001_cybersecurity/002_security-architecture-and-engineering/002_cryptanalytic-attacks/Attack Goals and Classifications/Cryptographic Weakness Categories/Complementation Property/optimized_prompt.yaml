  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the following: ''Given that the complementation property only halves the
    DES key space (from 2^56 to 2^55), was this weakness alone sufficient to render DES insecure in the 1990s, or were other
    factors like key length more critical? Support your position with evidence from DES history and modern cipher design.''
    Encourage critical thinking by requiring references to real-world attacks or standards like NIST FIPS 46-3.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    (2) Numerical (wrong reduction, e.g., ''quarters key space'' vs. halves), (3) Conceptual (confuses with unrelated like
    defense-in-depth or linear approximation). Ensure distractors are plausible based on voter-noted misconceptions (e.g.,
    NIST controls, differential probability).'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in cryptanalytic attacks.
  Topic: ''Complementation Property'' (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cryptanalytic Attacks
  > Attack Goals and Classifications > Cryptographic Weakness Categories > Complementation Property). ACCURACY CRITICAL: This
  is a DES weakness where E_K(P) = C implies E_K(~P) = ~C (bitwise complement), halving brute-force key space from 2^56 to
  2^55. IGNORE defense-in-depth/NIST SP 800-53; focus on crypto sources like Schneier ''Applied Cryptography'' or DES papers.

  Incorporate scaffolding layers progressively (10 cards per layer). Include active learning hooks (e.g., ''Apply to discussion:

  Output EXACTLY in JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''Question'', ''back'': {''correct_answer'': ''...'', ''distractors'':
  [''A'', ''B'', ''C''], ''explanation'': ''...'' }}]. Follow flashcard_schema precisely: MCQ with 3 distractors per protocol,
  full explanations. Ensure active recall: questions require computation/analysis, not rote. Vary formats: 40% definition/understand,
  30% apply/analyze, 30% evaluate/create.'
