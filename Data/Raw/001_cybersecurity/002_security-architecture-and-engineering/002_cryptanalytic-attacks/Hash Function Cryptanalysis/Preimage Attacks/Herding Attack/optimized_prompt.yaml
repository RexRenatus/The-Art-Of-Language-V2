active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''Herding attacks pose a greater threat to blockchain applications
    than traditional collision attacks due to their prefix control mechanism.'' Use examples from Kelsey & Kohno''s Nostradamus
    attack and real-world vulnerabilities in MD5 to support your arguments, considering mitigations like sponge constructions.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., botnet/C2 herding from unrelated contexts)'
    - 'Distractor 2: Related but incorrect crypto term (e.g., ''simple collision attack'' vs. multicollision-based herding)'
    - 'Distractor 3: Plausible partial truth (e.g., ''preimage attack without tree structure'')'
    - Ensure distractors are realistic errors from voter feedback or typical learner mistakes; avoid randomness—ground in
      accuracy corrections
