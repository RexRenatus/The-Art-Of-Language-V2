active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a scenario where a company migrates to SaaS applications, debate whether SAML or OIDC is better for
    SSO integration. Consider factors like security (e.g., XML signing vs. JWT), scalability, user experience, and interoperability
    with legacy systems. Support arguments with real-world examples.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'For MCQs (at least 50% of cards): 1 correct + 3 distractors. Distractors must be plausible based on
    common misconceptions (e.g., ''SSO eliminates all passwords'' vs. ''federated auth''; SAML as ''JSON-based'' vs. ''XML'';
    IdP as ''manages user data only'' vs. ''authenticates and issues tokens''). Ensure distractors test nuance (e.g., security
    risks like ''no MFA needed''). Vary difficulty: 1 easy (obvious wrong), 1 medium (partial truth), 1 hard (subtle trap).'

  Topic: Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cloud Service
  Models > SaaS > SaaS Identity and Access Management > SSO Integration). Use this research context: SSO allows single credentials
  for multiple apps (reduces password fatigue); Key terms: IdP (Okta/Azure AD/Google Workspace), SP/RP, Assertion, Trust Delegation,
  MFA, RBAC; Standards: SAML 2.0 (XML auth data exchange), OIDC/OAuth; Sources: SAML 2.0 spec (oasis-open.org), Okta SSO docs
  (okta.com/docs), Google Workspace IAM (support.google.com).
