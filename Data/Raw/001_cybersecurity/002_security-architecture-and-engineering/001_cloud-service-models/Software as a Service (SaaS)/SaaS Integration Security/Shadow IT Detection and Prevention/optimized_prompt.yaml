  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the pros and cons of Shadow IT: Is it always harmful, or can it drive
    innovation? Use real-world examples like employee use of unsanctioned tools for productivity and evaluate risks versus
    benefits in a SaaS-heavy environment.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    truths (e.g., CASB only for malware); 3) Confusable terms (e.g., SaaS vs. IaaS); 4) Voter-suggested gaps (e.g., ignore
    training in prevention). Ensure plausibility for active learning reinforcement.'

  Incorporate these elements:

  - **Learning Objectives**: [Insert the full ''learning_objectives'' array here].

  - **Active Learning**: Use discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving to inspire scenario-based cards.

  - **Scaffolding**: Cards must cover 4 layers progressively; label each.

  - **Research Context**: Shadow IT = unsanctioned IT (hardware/software/services); Types: unmanaged SaaS/cloud storage, packaged
  software (off-the-shelf installs), network appliances, personal devices. Risks: data exfiltration, compliance, visibility
  gaps. Detection: CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker), network traffic analysis, DNS logging. Prevention: user training,
  approved SaaS catalogs, zero-trust policies. Sources: ncsc.gov.uk, cisco.com.


  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards following the exact **Flashcard Schema**:

  Output ONLY as JSON array of flashcards, each with ''front'' and ''back'' objects. Ensure university-level pedagogy: Bloom''s
  progression, active recall, spaced repetition friendly. No fluff; precise, evidence-based.'
