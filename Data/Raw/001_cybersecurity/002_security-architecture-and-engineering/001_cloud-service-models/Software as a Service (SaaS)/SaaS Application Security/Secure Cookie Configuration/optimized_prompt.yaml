  **Research Context (Expanded from MDN Web Docs, RFC 6265, OWASP):** Cookies manage HTTP state but are vulnerable to XSS
  (steal via JS), CSRF (auto-sent cross-site), session hijacking (MITM). Key attributes:

  - **Secure**: Sent only over HTTPS (prevents MITM).

  - **HttpOnly**: Inaccessible via JavaScript (blocks XSS theft).

  - **SameSite**: Strict (no cross-site requests), Lax (safe top-level navigations), None (all cross-site, requires Secure).

  - **Domain/Path**: Restrict scope (e.g., Domain=app.example.com; Path=/secure).

  Best practices: Use Secure+HttpOnly+SameSite=Lax for sessions; test in browsers; follow RFC 6265 syntax.


  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:** HTTP statelessness, sessions, XSS/CSRF basics.


  **Learning Objectives (Bloom''s Taxonomy):** [Insert full learning_objectives array here].


  **Scaffolding Layers:** [Insert full scaffolding_layers array here]. Distribute flashcards across layers.


  **Active Learning Integration:** Draw from [discussion_prompt], [peer_teaching_activity], [problem_solving_exercise] for
  scenario-based cards (e.g., ''Debate-style: Which SameSite for e-commerce?'').


  **Generate 25 flashcards using the exact schema:**

  Output ONLY in JSON array of objects, each: {"type": "MCQ|Cloze|Short", "front": "...", "back": {...}}. Ensure high-quality,
  precise, educational content with no hallucinations. Vary difficulty to match objectives.'
