        "core_logic": "The 'Measured Launch' requirement, as defined in FPT_ML_EXT.1, focuses on verifying the integrity of the hypervisor and other core virtualization components during the boot process. It works by creating cryptographic measurements (hashes) of these components, ensuring they haven't been tampered with, which is crucial for establishing a trusted computing base before any VM operations begin.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Network access prevention, disk encryption, and auditing are important security measures but do not directly address the integrity verification of the hypervisor during its launch phase.",
        "analogy": "Measured Launch is like a pre-flight check for an airplane's critical systems (hypervisor components) before takeoff (VM execution), ensuring all parts are original and haven't been tampered with."
