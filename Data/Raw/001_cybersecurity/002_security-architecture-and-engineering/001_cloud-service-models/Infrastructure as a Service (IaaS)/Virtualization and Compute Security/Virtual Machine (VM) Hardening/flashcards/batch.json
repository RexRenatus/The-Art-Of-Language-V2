      "question_text": "NIST SP 800-125B discusses virtual firewalls. What is a significant disadvantage of using subnet-level virtual firewalls (running in dedicated VMs)?",
      "correct_answer": "They consume hypervisor resources (CPU, memory) that could otherwise be used for production applications, and their operation can be affected by VM migration.",
      "distractors": [
        {
          "text": "They are difficult to deploy and require specialized hardware.",
          "misconception": "Targets [deployment complexity misconception]: Subnet-level virtual firewalls are generally easy to deploy as they are just VMs."

        {
          "text": "They cannot inspect traffic between VMs on the same virtual switch.",

      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "Subnet-level virtual firewalls, running as dedicated VMs, compete for hypervisor resources, impacting the performance of production applications. Furthermore, their operation can be disrupted by VM migrations if not managed carefully, as their placement and connectivity are tied to the VM lifecycle.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly describe them as difficult to deploy, limit their traffic inspection scope, or claim incompatibility with overlay networks, failing to identify the core disadvantages of resource consumption and VM migration impact.",
        "analogy": "Using a subnet-level virtual firewall is like having a security guard stationed in a separate office to monitor a specific hallway; that office requires resources, and if the guard needs to move offices, their monitoring might be interrupted."
