active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the security trade-offs of hardware-assisted virtualization (e.g., Intel
    VT-x EPT vs. software-only approaches) in preventing VM escape attacks in cloud IaaS. Reference NIST SP 800-125A and real-world
    incidents like Venom (CVE-2015-3456). Which provides better isolation for multi-tenant environments, and why?
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these elements:

  - LEARNING OBJECTIVES: [insert full list from above]

  - SCAFFOLDING LAYERS: [insert full scaffolding from above]

  - ACTIVE LEARNING: Draw inspiration for contextual explanations (e.g., VM escape scenarios).

  - RESEARCH CONTEXT: Hardware-assisted virtualization (Intel VT-x/AMD-V) enhances VM isolation via VMX modes, VMCS, EPT/NPT;
  key for IaaS security; mitigates escapes; NIST SP 800-125 (Virtualization Security), SP 800-125A (Hypervisor Deployment);
  sources: Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer''s Manual Vol. 3C, AMD64 Architecture Programmer''s Manual
  Vol. 2, NIST publications.


  Generate 45 high-quality flashcards using the EXACT FLASHCARD SCHEMA [insert full schema from above]. Ensure progression:
  Start with Layer 1 (foundational recall), build to Layer 4 (evaluation/creation with security integrations). Use active
  recall, spaced repetition best practices (concise fronts, explanatory backs). Align each card to one objective and layer.
  Vary difficulty, emphasize security benefits (e.g., EPT for memory protection against escapes).


  Output ONLY a JSON object: {''layers'': {''layer1'': [array of cards], ''layer2'': [...], ...}, ''total_count'': 45}. No
  additional text.'
