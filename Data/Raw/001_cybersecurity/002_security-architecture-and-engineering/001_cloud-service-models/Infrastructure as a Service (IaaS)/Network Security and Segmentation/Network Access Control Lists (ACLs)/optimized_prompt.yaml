  Lists (ACLs) under the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cloud Service Models > Infrastructure
  as a Service (IaaS) > Network Security and Segmentation > Network Access Control Lists (ACLs).


  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM ABOVE]

  - Active learning: Use discussion/peer teaching/problem-solving to inspire scenario cards.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute cards across 4 layers: [INSERT FULL LAYERS FROM ABOVE].

  - Prior knowledge: Assume basics in IP/ports/protocols.

  - Research: ACLs are stateless (e.g., AWS NACLs at subnet) vs stateful (e.g., SGs); rules sequential with implicit deny;
  NIST SP 800-53 (AC-3, SC-7).

  - Best practices: Rule minimization, logging, audits; examples like ''permit tcp 10.0.1.0/24 any eq 1433 inbound''.


  Generate exactly 30 high-quality flashcards following the schema: [INSERT FULL SCHEMA FROM ABOVE]. Output as a JSON array
  of objects. Ensure active recall, plausible distractors from misconceptions (stateful confusion, scope errors). Cards must
  promote Bloom''s progression and voter consensus (e.g., AWS scenarios, debates). Make explanations educational with feedback.'
