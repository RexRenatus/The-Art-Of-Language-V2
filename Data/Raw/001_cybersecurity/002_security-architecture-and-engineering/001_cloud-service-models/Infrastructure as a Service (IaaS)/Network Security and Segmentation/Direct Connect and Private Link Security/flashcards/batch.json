      "detailed_explanation": {
        "core_logic": "A public VIF allows access to AWS public endpoints (e.g., S3 public buckets, EC2 public IPs) over the AWS backbone. However, this traffic is not automatically encrypted and remains exposed to potential internet-based threats if not further secured at the application or transport layer. Therefore, it's crucial to implement additional security measures, because the public VIF itself does not provide end-to-end encryption or protection against all internet-borne attacks.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Public VIFs don't automatically create IPsec tunnels. VGWs are for private VIFs. Public VIF traffic is not as isolated as private VIF traffic.",
        "analogy": "Using a public VIF is like having a dedicated, high-speed lane to a public marketplace. While the lane is private and avoids city traffic, the marketplace itself is public, and you still need to be aware of your surroundings and protect your belongings (data) from potential pickpockets (internet threats)."
