active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the differences in Shared Responsibility Models across AWS, Azure, and
    Google Cloud for IaaS/PaaS/SaaS. How do these impact workload portability security, and what strategies ensure consistent
    CIA protection during migrations? Support with examples from NIST SP 800-207.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
