  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the limitations of VSQs in mitigating fourth-party risks and attack surface
    expansion. How do they integrate with the Shared Responsibility Model? Provide real-world examples from cloud breaches
    (e.g., SolarWinds).
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    800-171); (2) Partial truth (e.g., outdated standard); (3) Irrelevant but related term (e.g., GDPR instead of SOC 2).
    Ensure distractors test nuance, not trivia.'

  **Context and Research:** VSQs are standardized questionnaires for assessing vendor security posture in TPRM, mitigating
  fourth-party risks and attack surface expansion. Key concepts: VSQ (aka VRAQ), TPRM, Shared Responsibility Model (validates
  provider duties in IaaS/PaaS/SaaS). Standards: NIST CSF, NIST SP 800-171 (CUI protection), SOC 2, CSA CAIQ (CSA''s cloud
  questionnaire), ISO 27001. Big picture: Enables secure cloud architectures, reduces risks. Prerequisites: Shared Responsibility
  Model. Sample VSQ questions: (1) Encryption standards at rest/transit?; (2) SOC 2 report evidence?; (3) Fourth-party assessment
  process? Sources: NIST.gov (SP 800-171), cloudsecurityalliance.org (CAIQ), upguard.com/blog/nist-sp-800-171, aicpa.org (SOC
  2).


  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Learning Objectives: [Insert the full learning_objectives array here].

  - Scaffolding: Progress from Layer 1 (Foundation: definitions) to Layer 4 (Integration: TPRM links). Use concept map: VSQ
  → TPRM Controls → Standards/Risks/Processes.

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to discussion (fourth-party risks), peer teaching (standards), problem-solving (sample
  responses).


  **Generate 40-50 high-quality flashcards following the exact flashcard_schema:** Balance Bloom''s levels, include distractors
  per protocol, explanations with all requirements. Ensure university-level rigor: active recall, spaced repetition friendly.
  Output as a JSON array: [{''type'': ''...'', ''front'': ''...'', ''back'': ''...'', ''blooms_level'': ''...'', ''scaffolding_layer'':
  ''1-4''}].


  Prioritize progression: Start with REMEMBER flashcards, build to CREATE.'
