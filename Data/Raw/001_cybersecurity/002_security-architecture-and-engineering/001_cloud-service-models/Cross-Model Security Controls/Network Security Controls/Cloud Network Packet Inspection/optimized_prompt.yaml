  Research Context (complete): Packet Inspection examines traffic at packet level for threats/policies. Cloud specifics: East-West
  (intra-cloud, e.g., VM-VM), North-South (ingress/egress). DPI (payload), Stateful (connection tracking), Stateless (per-packet).
  Standards: NIST SP 1800-35 (ZTA with micro-segmentation), CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark (Rule 5.3: Network Firewalls), AWS
  Network Firewall (stateful/DPI/Suricata), Azure NSGs/Flow Logs, GCP Armor, tools: Suricata/Zeek. Breaches: Capital One (2019,
  east-west gaps). Best practices: ZTA integration, hybrid policies.


  Concept Map: Central ''Cloud Packet Inspection'' → ''Traffic Flows (E/W:N-S)'', ''Techniques (DPI:Stateful/Stateless)'',
  ''Standards (NIST 1800-35:CIS)'', → Hierarchy links.


  Generate 25 flashcards per flashcard_generation_schema. Balance: 30% Layer1/Remember-Understand, 25% Layer2/Analyze, 25%
  Layer3/Apply, 20% Layer4/Evaluate-Create. Questions: Varied (MCQ implied by distractors, short answer). Distractors: 3 exactly,
  plausible (e.g., ''East-west is internet traffic'' expl: ''No, that''s north-south''). Explanations: Cite standards/research.


  Prior knowledge: Learners know traditional firewalls; contrast with cloud dynamism.
