  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''SDP completely replaces traditional VPNs in modern cybersecurity.''
    Use evidence from SDP''s dynamic perimeter, attack surface reduction, and CSA specifications to support your position,
    considering real-world scenarios like remote workforces and cloud migrations.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Active Learning: Tie flashcards to discussion (e.g., SDP vs. VPN), peer teaching (components), problem-solving (deployment
  scenarios).

  - Scaffolding: [insert full 4 layers above].

  - Prior Knowledge: Link to firewalls, VPNs, Zero Trust basics.

  - Key Comparisons: SDP vs. VPN (dynamic/identity vs. static/network); SDP vs. ZTNA (full perimeter invisibility vs. app-level;
  SDP for networks/infra, ZTNA for apps).

  - Sources: CSA SDP Specification v2.0 (https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/software-defined-perimeter-specification-v2-0/),
  CSA Zero Trust resources.
