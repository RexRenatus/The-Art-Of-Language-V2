  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the following: ''Is a DPIA always required for large-scale cloud data
    processing in SaaS models, even if no sensitive data is involved? Use GDPR triggers and real-world examples (e.g., cloud
    data leaks like the 2021 AWS misconfiguration breaches) to support your position. Consider roles of data controllers vs.
    processors.'''
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
