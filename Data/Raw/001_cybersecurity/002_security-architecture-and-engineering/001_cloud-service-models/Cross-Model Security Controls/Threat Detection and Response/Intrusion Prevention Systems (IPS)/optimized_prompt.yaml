  Big Picture Context: IPS enables proactive threat prevention across cloud models (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS), building on firewalls/IDS
  for hybrid/multi-cloud protection against APTs/ransomware.

  - Active Learning: [PASTE FULL DETAILS FROM JSON] – Tie flashcards to these (e.g., ''Use for peer teaching'').

  - Scaffolding Layers: [PASTE FULL DETAILS FROM JSON] – Distribute flashcards across layers.

  - Research Context: Use the completed summary including core concepts (IPS/IDPS definitions, false pos/neg, tuning, evasion),
  functions, detection methodologies (signature-based: pros low FP/cons zero-day; anomaly-based: pros novel threats/cons high
  FP; stateful protocol: protocol checks), deployment (NIPS/HIPS/WIPS/NBA), evasion techniques, cloud examples (AWS Network
  Firewall, Azure Defender), NIST SP 800-94 Rev. 1.
