active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: How would you apply this concept in your work environment?
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains PoLP using the analogy of apartment building keycards (only access to your
    floor, not the whole building), then switches roles to teach how RBAC implements PoLP. Peers critique and refine the explanation.
  problem_solving: 'Given a development team needing to deploy an AWS Lambda function: Design an IAM policy minimizing privileges
    (e.g., read-only S3 access for specific buckets, no delete permissions). Test in a simulated console and justify choices
    against common misconceptions like ''admin rights for troubleshooting''.'

  Incorporate this structured content for high-quality, pedagogically optimized flashcards:


  **Learning Objectives** (Bloom''s Taxonomy progression): [insert learning_objectives array here]


  **Active Learning Elements** (integrate into explanations/scenarios): [insert active_learning object here]


  **Scaffolding Layers** (generate cards balanced across layers): [insert scaffolding object here]


  **Research Context**: PoLP grants minimal access to reduce attack surface/blast radius. Anti-patterns: over-privileged accounts.
  Frameworks: NIST SP 800-53, ISO 27001, Zero Trust. Examples: AWS IAM policies, Capital One breach (over-priv IAM), SolarWinds
  (service account excesses). Sources: owasp.org, aws.amazon.com, nist.gov/SP800-53, iso.org/27001.


  **Generation Instructions**: Use Flashcard Schema exactly: [insert flashcard_schema object here]. Output ONLY a JSON array
  of flashcards: [{''id'':1, ''bloom_level'':''REMEMBER'', ''layer'':''1'', ''type'':''cloze'', ''front'':''...'', ''back'':{''answer'':''...'',
  ''explanation'':''...'', ''distractors'':[''...'']}}, ...]. Ensure variety, active recall, spaced repetition suitability.
  Cover prerequisites, concept map (PoLP central), best practices (dynamic perms via groups).'
