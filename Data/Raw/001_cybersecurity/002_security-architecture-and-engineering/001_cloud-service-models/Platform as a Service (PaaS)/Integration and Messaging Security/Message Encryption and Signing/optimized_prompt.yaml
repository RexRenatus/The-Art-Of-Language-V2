active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a PaaS environment like integrating microservices via message queues, discuss how digital signing
    prevents non-repudiation issues. Share examples of real-world breaches (e.g., unauthorized message alterations) and propose
    mitigations using NIST FIPS 186-5 compliant algorithms.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 distractors per MCQ: (1) Common misconception (e.g., confuse signing with encryption),
    (2) Partial truth (e.g., correct property but wrong mechanism), (3) Extreme/implausible error (e.g., outdated algorithm).

system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:\
  \ Message Encryption and Signing (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cloud Service Models\
  \ > Platform as a Service (PaaS) > Integration and Messaging Security > Message Encryption and Signing). Use this research\
  \ context: Encryption converts plaintext to ciphertext for confidentiality (e.g., AES/RSA); digital signing uses private\
  \ key on hash for authentication, integrity, non-repudiation (NIST FIPS 186-5 DSS). Focus on PaaS messaging like secure\
  \ APIs/queues.\n\nIncorporate these pedagogical elements:\n- Learning Objectives: [insert array above]\n- Active Learning:\
  \ Inspire cards with discussion/peer/problem-solving hooks (e.g., scenario questions).\n- Scaffolding: Generate ~5-8 cards\
  \ per layer 1-4 [insert layers above].\n- Bloom's Coverage: Balance across all levels.\n\nGenerate 25-35 high-quality flashcards\
  \ following this exact schema per card:\n{\n  \"front\": \"Question (MCQ: A/B/C/D options; or cloze/basic)\",\n  \"back\"\
  : {\n    \"correct_answer\": \"...\",\n    \"explanation\": \"...\",\n    \"bloom_level\": \"Remember|Understand|Apply|Analyze|Evaluate|Create\"\

  \ 3 plausible per MCQ protocol [insert protocol]. Explanations: Detailed per requirements [insert]. Mix 60% MCQ, 20% cloze,\
  \ 20% basic. Optimize for Anki: concise fronts, rich backs. Ensure university pedagogy: active recall, spaced repetition\
  \ friendly. Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcards."
