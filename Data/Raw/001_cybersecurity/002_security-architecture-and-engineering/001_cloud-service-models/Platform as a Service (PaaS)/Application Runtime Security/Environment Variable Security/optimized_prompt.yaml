  **Topic Context & Hierarchy:**

  - Level 1: Cybersecurity

  - Level 2: Security Architecture And Engineering

  - Level 3: Cloud Service Models

  - Level 4: Platform as a Service (PaaS)

  - Level 5: Application Runtime Security

  - Level 6: Environment Variable Security


  Key concepts from research: Environment variables store configs/secrets (e.g., API keys); risks include cleartext storage
  (CWE-526), visible in processes/logs, increased attack surface; best practices: least privilege, secret managers (Vault,
  AWS Secrets Manager), rotation, no cleartext.


  **Learning Objectives:** [INSERT ARRAY FROM learning_objectives]

  **Scaffolding Layers:** Generate 5-8 cards per layer [INSERT FROM scaffolding]. Cover all Bloom''s levels proportionally.

  **Active Learning Tie-in:** Inspire cards from discussion (trade-offs), peer teaching (CWE-526 explanations), problem-solving
  (PaaS scenarios).


  **Generation Instructions:**

  - Create 24-32 high-quality flashcards (balanced across layers, types: 40% basic, 40% MCQ, 20% cloze; all Bloom''s levels).

  - Ensure variety: 30% remember/understand, 40% apply/analyze, 30% evaluate/create.

  - Use Flashcard Schema exactly [INSERT FULL SCHEMA].

  - Questions: Active, scenario-based for PaaS (e.g., ''In a Heroku app...''). Answers: Precise, no spoilers.

  - Distractors: Follow protocol strictly.

  - Explanations: Pedagogical, with ties to objectives/layers.


  Output ONLY a valid JSON array of flashcards, nothing else.'
