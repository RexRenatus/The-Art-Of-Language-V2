active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of using TLS for transport-layer security versus SASL for
    authentication in AMQP-based message queues. Consider performance impacts, compliance with OASIS standards, and real-world
    PaaS deployments like OpenStack. Support arguments with examples from RabbitMQ or ZeroMQ.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate 3 plausible distractors per MCQ:

    - Base on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse SASL with SSL; mix up ZeroMQ peer-to-peer with broker models).

    - Draw from research: Partial truths (e.g., ''Uses only TLS, no SASL''), outdated tech, or unrelated protocols.

    - Ensure plausible to experts (e.g., real but incorrect broker names like ''Apache Kafka'' for AMQP).

    - One syntactic trap, one conceptual error, one overgeneralization.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in (ISC)² domains. Topic:
  Message Queue Security (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cloud Service Models > Platform
  as a Service (PaaS) > API and Middleware Security > Message Queue Security). Use this research context: Message queues enable
  asynchronous IPC via brokers like RabbitMQ, Qpid, ZeroMQ. AMQP 1.0 (OASIS) Part 5: Security uses TLS for encrypted/authenticated
  transport and SASL for authentication. Focus on PaaS middleware security.
