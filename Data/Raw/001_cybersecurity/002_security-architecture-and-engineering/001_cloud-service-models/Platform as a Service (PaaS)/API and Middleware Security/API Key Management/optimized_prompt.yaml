active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between convenience (e.g., long-lived API keys) and security
    (e.g., frequent rotation) in a PaaS environment. How does NIST SP 800-228 influence your arguments? Provide real-world
    examples from cloud breaches.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator specializing in cybersecurity education, aligned with university pedagogy
  (Bloom''s Taxonomy, active learning, scaffolding). Generate 25 high-quality flashcards on ''API Key Management'' in the
  context of Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cloud Service Models > Platform as a Service (PaaS) >
  API and Middleware Security > API Key Management.


  Incorporate this research context: API Key (unique identifier for API auth), Secret (confidential creds like keys/passwords),
  Key Management (lifecycle: generate/distribute/store/use/rotate/destroy), Least Privilege Access (minimal perms), Rotation
  (regular updates), Revocation (invalidate compromised keys), NIST SP 800-228 (API protection guidelines for cloud-native
  systems).
