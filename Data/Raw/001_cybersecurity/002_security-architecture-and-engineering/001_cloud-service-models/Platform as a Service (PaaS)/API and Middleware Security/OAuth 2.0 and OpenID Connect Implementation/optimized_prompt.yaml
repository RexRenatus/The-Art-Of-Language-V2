active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the trade-offs of using the OAuth 2.0 Implicit Flow versus Authorization Code Flow with PKCE for
    single-page applications (SPAs) in a PaaS environment. Consider security implications for API middleware, such as token
    exposure risks and compliance with standards like RFC 6749.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate these elements:

  - Learning Objectives: [PASTE FULL LIST HERE]

  - Active Learning: Inspire questions from discussion (e.g., flow trade-offs), peer teaching (e.g., roles), problem-solving
  (e.g., scenarios).

  - Scaffolding: Distribute evenly (10 cards/layer): Layer 1 Foundation (terms), Layer 2 Components (flows/tokens), Layer
  3 Implementation (steps/best practices), Layer 4 Integration (PaaS/security).

  - Use research context: OAuth 2.0 (RFC 6749: authorization, roles, access tokens); OIDC (openid.net: ID Token JWT for authn);
  focus on secure PaaS API impl.

  - Flashcard Schema: MCQ (80%, 4 options A-D); cloze/short-answer (20%). Front: Question+options. Back: **Correct Answer**,
  Explanation (why correct/distractors wrong, 50-100 words, objective tie-in, active learning link, RFC ref), Bloom''s level
  (e.g., Analyze), Layer (1-4).


  Distractors: Plausible errors (misconceptions, swaps, outdated flows). Ensure progressive difficulty: simple recall in L1,
  analysis/eval in L4. Optimize for Anki/Spaced Repetition: active recall, no hints on front.


  Output ONLY a JSON array of 40 flashcards: [{''front'': ''Question text'', ''back'': ''Full back content'', ''bloom_level'':
  ''Analyze'', ''layer'': 2}, ...]. No extra text.'
