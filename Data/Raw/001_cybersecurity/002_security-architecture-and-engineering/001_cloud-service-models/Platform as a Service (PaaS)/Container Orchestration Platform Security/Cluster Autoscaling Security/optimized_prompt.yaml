active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a multi-tenant Kubernetes environment using cluster autoscaling, discuss the trade-offs between rapid
    node provisioning for performance and the risks of introducing unvetted nodes. How does the shared responsibility model
    influence mitigation strategies? Provide examples from EKS or similar platforms.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Generate 3 distractors that are plausible based on common errors (e.g., confusing Cluster Autoscaler with HPA; overlooking
      shared responsibility).
    - 'Distractor 1: Semantic trap (similar wording, wrong concept).'
    - 'Distractor 2: Overgeneralization (applies to general K8s but not autoscaling).'
    - 'Distractor 3: Edge case reversal (true in some contexts but false here).'
    ensure_diversity: 'Vary across cards: 40% multiple-choice, 30% true/false with explanation, 30% open-ended with hints.'
