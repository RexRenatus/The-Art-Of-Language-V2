active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between the performance insights gained from RUM (e.g.,
    real-time user session data) and privacy risks like fingerprinting or cross-context recognition. How should organizations
    balance user experience optimization with compliance to standards like W3C privacy principles? Provide examples from PaaS
    environments.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    - Generate 3 distractors based on common misconceptions from research (e.g., confuse fingerprinting with cookies; overlook
      PaaS context)
    - 'Make plausible: Use similar terms (e.g., ''synthetic monitoring'' vs RUM), partial truths, or edge cases'
    - 'Vary: 1 semantic trap, 1 overgeneralization, 1 unrelated but technical term'
    - 'Avoid: Obvious falsehoods or giveaways; ensure correct answer is distinctly best'
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in 'Real User Monitoring (RUM)\
  \ Privacy' under the topic hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cloud Service Models > Platform\
  \ as a Service (PaaS) > Application Performance and Monitoring > Real User Monitoring (RUM) Privacy.\n\nIncorporate these\
  \ pedagogical elements:\n- Bloom's Taxonomy objectives: [insert learning_objectives array here]\n- Active learning: [insert\
  \ active_learning object here]\n- Scaffolding layers: [insert scaffolding object here]\n\nGenerate 50 high-quality flashcards\
  \ (10-15 per scaffolding layer, balanced across Bloom's levels). Use research context: RUM monitors real user sessions (page\

  \ from W3C (fingerprinting-guidance, privacy-principles), zenarmor.com.\n\nStrictly follow the flashcard_schema:\n- Output\
  \ as JSON array of objects, each with 'front', 'back' (nested object), 'metadata'.\n- 40% MCQs with 3 distractors per protocol.\n\
  - Ensure active recall: Questions test application/analysis in PaaS.\n- Vary difficulty; reference sources.\n\nExample card:\n\
