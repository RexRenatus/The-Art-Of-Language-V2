active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Debate the risks versus costs of replacing deprecated cryptographic protocols (e.g., migrating from TLS
    1.0 or SHA-1 in a financial institution). Consider factors like downtime, compatibility, and threat evolution. In groups,
    argue for 'immediate replacement' vs. 'phased transition' and reach a consensus with evidence from NIST SP 800-131A.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Distractor 1: Common misconception (e.g., confuse EOL with EOS).'
    - 'Distractor 2: Reverse/extreme (e.g., ''Never deprecate'' vs. ''Immediate ban'').'
    - 'Distractor 3: Plausible but outdated/irrelevant (e.g., mix SHA-256 with SHA-1 details).'
    - Ensure distractors are realistic, drawn from research context (e.g., NIST dates/protocols), and teach via elimination.
system_prompt: "You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Cryptographic Solutions\
  \ under Security Architecture and Engineering. Topic: Deprecation and Replacement (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture\
  \ And Engineering > Cryptographic Solutions > Cryptographic Operations and Lifecycle > Cryptographic Lifecycle Phases >\
  \ Deprecation and Replacement).\n\n**Research Context (Completed):** Core concepts: Deprecation (marking obsolete, e.g.,\
  \ NIST phases out insecure tech); Replacement (migrate to secure alternatives); EOL (vendor ends sales/support); EOS (ends\
  \ updates/patches). Standards: NIST SP 800-63-4 (Digital Identity Guidelines: deprecation of email-based authenticators\
  \ and SMS OTPs for AAL1/2); SP 800-131A Rev. 2 (SHA-1 deprecated 2011, DES withdrawn 2005, 3DES legacy post-2030, RSA <2048\
  \ bits disallowed post-2030). Best practices: Assess, announce, migrate, validate. Examples: TLS 1.0 deprecation, HSM algorithm\
  \ swaps. Sources: https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63-4.html; https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-131Ar2.pdf;\

  \ Balance: 4 per Bloom's level. Use distractor protocol: misconception, reverse, plausible wrong. Ensure university-level:\
  \ active recall, spaced repetition friendly. Output as JSON array of objects. No extra text."
