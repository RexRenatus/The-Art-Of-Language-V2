learning_objectives:
  remember:
  - objective: Define cryptographic service availability and key terms including resilience, disruption, Cryptographic Key
      Management System (CKMS), and availability in the CIA Triad.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  - objective: List the primary sources of disruptions to cryptographic services (e.g., hardware failures, DoS attacks, natural
      disasters).
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  understand:
  - objective: Explain how NIST SP 800-130 addresses availability in CKMS design, including disaster recovery and failure
      management.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  - objective: Describe the relationship between cryptographic service availability and the broader CIA Triad, particularly
      how disruptions impact confidentiality and integrity.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  create:
  - objective: Design a disaster recovery plan for a CKMS that integrates monitoring, automated failover, and testing to ensure
      high availability.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  analyze:
  - objective: Analyze the impact of a specific disruption (e.g., HSM hardware failure) on cryptographic operations and identify
      mitigation priorities.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  evaluate:
  - objective: Evaluate the effectiveness of redundancy strategies (e.g., clustered HSMs) versus backup keys in achieving
      99.9% CKMS availability.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
  apply:
  - objective: Apply NIST SP 800-130 guidelines to outline a basic failover procedure for a cryptographic service outage.
    verbs: []
    measurable: true
active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs between high availability (e.g., 99.99% uptime) and cost
    in deploying redundant cryptographic services like HSM clusters. Reference NIST SP 800-130 and real-world examples such
    as cloud outages.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  **Context:** Use the provided Research Context (completed): Cryptographic service availability ensures crypto systems (encryption,
  key mgmt) are accessible despite disruptions. NIST SP 800-130 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/130/final) framework for
  CKMS: availability goals include disaster recovery, failure mgmt (hardware/software), service continuity via redundancy/monitoring.
