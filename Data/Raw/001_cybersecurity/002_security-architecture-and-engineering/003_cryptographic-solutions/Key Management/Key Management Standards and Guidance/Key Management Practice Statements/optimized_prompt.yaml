  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the statement: ''KMPS is more critical than KMP for preventing key compromise
    breaches like SolarWinds.'' Support your position with references from NIST SP 800-57 and evaluate potential compliance
    gaps in real-world implementations.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.

  **Context and Research:** KMPS are detailed documents elaborating on Key Management Policy (KMP) for cryptographic key lifecycle
  (generate, distribute, store, use, revoke, destroy). Primary source: NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 Rev. 5 ([link](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/57/pt1/r5/final))
  - general guidance; Part 2 Rev. 5 ([link](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/57/pt2/r5/final)) - policy planning. NIST CSF:
  Protect function includes key mgmt. Big picture: Mitigates key compromise risks (e.g., SolarWinds, Capital One breaches).
  Prior knowledge: Basic crypto keys/algorithms. Sources: [NIST SP 800-57 Part 1](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/57/pt1/r5/final),
  [Part 2](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/57/pt2/r5/final), ISO 27001 Annex A.13.
