active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges of implementing CKMS SP versus CKMS PS in a hybrid cloud
    environment. Use NIST SP 800-57 Part 2 to support arguments on policy vs. practice trade-offs, and reference how prior
    knowledge of symmetric/asymmetric keys influences decisions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    CKMS SP with CKMS PS; mix symmetric/asymmetric practices; reference outdated standards). Ensure distractors are web-grounded
