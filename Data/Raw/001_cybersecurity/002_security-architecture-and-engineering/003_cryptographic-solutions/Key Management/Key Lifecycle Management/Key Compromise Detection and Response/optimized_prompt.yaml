active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a scenario where a cryptographic key is suspected to be compromised via an insider threat, debate
    the pros and cons of immediate key rotation versus investigative monitoring, referencing NIST SP 800-57 guidelines (e.g.,
    Part 1 on response actions, Part 3 on application-specific considerations). What factors (e.g., key usage criticality,
    evidence strength) influence the decision? Support arguments with real-world examples like Heartbleed.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 'Generate plausible distractors based on: (1) Common misconceptions (e.g., ''rotate before revoking''
    instead of NIST order); (2) Partial truths (e.g., valid for other contexts like non-crypto keys); (3) Reversals (e.g.,
    detection step as response); (4) Irrelevant standards (e.g., mix with PCI-DSS). Ensure distractors test nuance from research/voter
    inputs.'

  - Active Learning: Use discussion/peer/problem-solving to inspire scenario flashcards.

  - Scaffolding: [INSERT CONCEPT MAP AND 4 LAYERS FROM ABOVE]. Distribute flashcards evenly across layers.

  - Research Context: Core concepts (key compromise causes: theft, disclosure, malware, insiders, attacks; detection: logs/anomalies/HSM;
  response: revoke/rotate/review). NIST SP 800-57 (Part 1: General/compromise handling; Part 2: Implementation/recovery; Part
  3: Application-specific). Heartbleed example. Sources: NIST SP 800-57 Pt1 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r5.pdf),
