active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare bcrypt with Argon2 and scrypt for password hashing in a high-traffic web application. Which is
    best and why? Consider memory-hardness, parallelization resistance (e.g., GPU attacks), computation speed (<100ms per
    login), and alignment with NIST SP 800-63B. Support with pros/cons table.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    with encryption), B) Shortens hash (ignores fixed output), C) Adds randomness (salt''s role), D) Correct: Increases iterations
    for brute-force resistance. Base on voter MCQ ex., research errors (e.g., bcrypt=encryption), SHA-256 pitfalls.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Bloom''s Taxonomy-aligned,
  active-learning flashcards. Topic: bcrypt Algorithm (Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering >
  Cryptographic Solutions > Hash Functions and Message Authentication > Password Hashing and Key Derivation > bcrypt Algorithm).
  Use provided scaffolding, objectives, active learning, prior knowledge, concept map, and research context (bcrypt: 1999,
  Blowfish-based, salt+cost+Eksblowfish; NIST SP 800-63B; best practices: cost 12-14, libs like Node/Python bcrypt; ex hash
  $2b$12$...; LinkedIn breach).


  Generate 30 high-quality flashcards strictly following the flashcard_schema: 10 Basic, 10 Cloze, 10 MCQ. Ensure:

  - Coverage: All 6 learning_objectives (label Bloom''s level), 4 scaffolding layers, voter priorities (e.g., misconceptions,
  comparisons to Argon2/scrypt).

  - Pedagogy: Scaffolding progression (Foundation easy, Integration hard); active hooks (e.g., ''Discuss: vs Argon2''); measurable
  (e.g., ''List 3 components'').

  - Distractors: Per protocol, misconception-based.

  - Explanations: Per requirements, concise, cited.
