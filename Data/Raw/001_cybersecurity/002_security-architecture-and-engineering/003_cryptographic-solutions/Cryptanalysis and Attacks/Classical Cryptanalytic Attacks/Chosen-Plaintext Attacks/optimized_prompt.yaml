active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate why semantic security is essential against CPA. Use examples like the ECB
    penguin vulnerability or historical Caesar cipher breaks to argue if batch CPA suffices or if adaptive CPA is always needed.
    Reflect on real-world implications for modern systems.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - Plausible based on common misconceptions (e.g., confuse CPA with known-plaintext; mix batch/adaptive definitions; partial
      truths like 'CPA reveals key directly' vs. 'gains info to compromise').
    - '1 distractor: Overly simplistic/historical focus (e.g., ''Only for Caesar cipher'').'
    - '1 distractor: Modern confusion (e.g., ''Secure in AES-ECB'').'
    - '1 distractor: Inverse/wrong model (e.g., ''Attacker chooses ciphertext'').'
    - Avoid obvious errors; ensure ~25% learner error rate for challenge.
    - 'Vary difficulty by Bloom''s level: Remember=definition twists; Create=flawed strategies.'
    count: 3
    generation_guideline: Ground in research/voter examples (Caesar, Vigenère, ECB); test for plausibility.
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in cryptanalysis. Topic: ''Chosen-Plaintext
  Attacks'' (Category: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cryptographic Solutions > Cryptanalysis and
  Attacks > Classical Cryptanalytic Attacks > Chosen-Plaintext Attacks). Use this research context: CPA allows attackers to
  choose plaintexts and get ciphertexts via an oracle to compromise semantic security (IND-CPA). Forms: batch (upfront) vs.
  adaptive. Examples: Caesar (choose ''A'' to find shift), Vigenère (reveal period), ECB penguin (pattern leakage).
