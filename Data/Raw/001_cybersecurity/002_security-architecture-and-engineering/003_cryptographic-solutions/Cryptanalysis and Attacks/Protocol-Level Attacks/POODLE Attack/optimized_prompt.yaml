active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the trade-offs of supporting legacy protocols like SSL 3.0 for backward
    compatibility versus the security risks exposed by POODLE. Consider real-world impacts on industries like banking or IoT,
    and propose a balanced policy. Use evidence from RFC 7507 and historical CVE data.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in POODLE Attack (Topic Hierarchy:
  Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cryptographic Solutions > Cryptanalysis and Attacks > Protocol-Level
  Attacks > POODLE Attack). Generate 50 high-quality flashcards using the provided schema, covering all learning objectives
  (Bloom''s: REMEMBER to CREATE), 4 scaffolding layers, and active learning elements. Incorporate voter consensus: detailed
  step-by-step attack (downgrade, MITM, record split, padding oracle byte-by-byte), prior knowledge (SSL/TLS handshake, CBC,
  MITM), big picture (SSL3 deprecation, RFC 7568), sources (Wikipedia, CVE-2014-3566, RFC 7507/7568). Research: POODLE exploits
  SSL 3.0 CBC padding via downgrade oracle.
