active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a world with increasing IoT devices and cryptographic protocols, debate the risks of OID namespace
    exhaustion or mismanagement, drawing from real-world examples like past IANA assignment conflicts. Propose solutions for
    sustainable OID allocation.
  peer_teaching: Students draw a partner from a hat and are assigned a specific OID arc (e.g., ITU's iso(1) vs. IANA's private
    enterprise). The 'teacher' explains the hierarchy, delegation, and cybersecurity use cases; the 'learner' summarizes key
    points and quizzes back with 2-3 questions, then switch roles.
  problem_solving: 'Your company needs a unique OID for a new cryptographic protocol under the private enterprise arc. In
    groups, simulate the registration process with IANA: identify requirements, submit a mock request form, handle a conflict
    with another firm claiming the same branch, and document compliance steps. Present resolutions and cybersecurity implications.'

    2) Wrong RA (e.g., attribute ITU to IANA); 3) Misunderstand arcs (e.g., say ISO manages internet(1)); 4) Ignore fees/delegation;
    5) Overlook cybersecurity uses (e.g., PKI). Ensure plausible, e.g., similar-sounding RAs or adjacent arcs.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Object Identifiers (OIDs)

  Compliance, and Governance > Certification and Validation > Object Identifiers (OIDs) Registration).


  **Research Context:** OIDs are hierarchical dot-separated numeric identifiers (e.g., 1.3.6.1) used in cybersecurity for
  unique naming in PKI (X.509), SNMP (RFC 2578), ASN.1. Tree root managed by ITU/ISO; key arcs: iso(1), joint-iso-itu-t(2),
  org(3), dod(6).internet(1). RAs: ITU (top-level), IANA (internet(1), private enterprise at iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers),
  HL7 (healthcare). Standards: ITU-T X.660 series (OID specs), RFC 2578 (MIBs), X.509 (certs). Registration: Identify RA,
  submit form (e.g., IANA), pay fees, receive OID. Risks: Exhaustion in IoT/PKI.


  **Pedagogy Integration:** Generate 50 high-quality flashcards progressing through scaffolding layers (Layer 1: Foundation
  - defs/prior knowledge; Layer 2: Components - structure/RAs/standards; Layer 3: Implementation - steps/MCQs; Layer 4: Integration
  - cyber relevance/activities). Align to objectives: [insert full learning_objectives array]. Incorporate active learning:
  Tie 10% cards to discussion (OID exhaustion), peer teaching (arc explanations), problem-solving (registration sim).


  **Output Format:** JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''Question'', ''back'': {''correct_answer'': ''...'', ''explanation'':
  ''...'', ''distractors'': [{''option'': ''A'', ''why_wrong'': ''...''}], ''reference'': ''Layer X, Objective Y'', ''bloom_level'':
  ''Apply''}}]. Strictly follow flashcard_schema: MCQ-heavy, distractors from protocol, explanations comprehensive. Ensure
  university-level: active recall, spaced repetition friendly, misconception-busting. Vary difficulty across Bloom''s.'
