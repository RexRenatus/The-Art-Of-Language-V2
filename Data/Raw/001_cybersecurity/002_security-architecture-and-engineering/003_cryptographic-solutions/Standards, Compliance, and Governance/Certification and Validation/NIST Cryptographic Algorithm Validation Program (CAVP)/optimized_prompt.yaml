active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the real-world implications of skipping CAVP validation for FIPS-approved
    algorithms in federal systems. Consider historical crypto failures (e.g., Dual_EC_DRBG) and argue for or against mandatory
    CAVP in private sector adoption. Synthesize group consensus on risk mitigation strategies.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.
