active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group discussion, debate the challenges of balancing strict ISO 27001:2022 Annex A 8.24 compliance
    (e.g., legal cryptography restrictions) with practical security needs in a global organization handling sensitive data.
    Provide examples of trade-offs and propose solutions.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

    rules:
    - 'Generate 3 plausible distractors for MCQs: 1) Common misconception (e.g., confusing authenticity with availability),
      2) Prior version detail (e.g., 2013 split controls), 3) Incomplete/overly simplistic answer (e.g., ignoring key rotation).'
    - Ensure distractors are 70-80% similar to correct answer to challenge understanding.
    - Avoid obvious wrongs; base on research context (e.g., outdated algorithms, regulatory oversights).

  - Learning objectives: [INSERT FULL LIST FROM learning_objectives]

  - Active learning: Weave in prompts from [discussion_prompt, peer_teaching_activity, problem_solving_exercise] into back
  explanations.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards across 4 layers [INSERT FULL SCAFFOLDING DETAILS]; tag each with layer.

  - Prior knowledge: Assume familiarity with CIA triad and basic ISO 27001 from entry domains.

  - Content completeness: Cover definitions (cryptography, CIA+authenticity), policy/key management, risk assessment/data
  classification, implementation steps, comparisons (2022 vs 2013), best practices (algorithms, training, auditing), integration
  (other controls, post-quantum, ISMS fit for certification, breach prevention).

  - Research: Base on ISO 27001:2022 (replaces 2013 A10.1.1/10.1.2), ISO 27002:2022 guidelines, isms.online.
