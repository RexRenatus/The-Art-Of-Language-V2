    quantum computers''); 2) Partial truth (e.g., outdated NIST ref); 3) Confusable term mix-up (e.g., symmetric vs. asymmetric).
    Ensure distractors test subtle understanding, not trivia.'

  **Content Summary (use this exclusively, completing truncated sections):** Core Concepts: Cryptography (science of secure
  communication using codes and ciphers; encryption/decryption). Cryptographic Policy: Rules for selecting/implementing/managing
  crypto (algorithms, keys, transitions). PQC: Quantum-resistant algorithms (NIST standardizing via competitions). Key Management:
  Generate/distribute/store/use/destroy keys (NIST SP 800-57 Parts 1-3). Crypto-Agility: Easy algorithm/protocol swaps. Standards:
  NIST SP 800-57 (key mgmt policy/lifecycle); NISTIR 7977 (full key mgmt lifecycle: pre-op, op, post-op phases, automation
  guidance); FIPS 140-3 (module validation); NIST PQC (e.g., CRYSTALS-Kyber, Dilithium). Sources: NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 v5
  (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r5.pdf); NISTIR 7977 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2017/NIST.IR.7977.pdf);

  **Pedagogy Integration:**

  - Align flashcards to these Learning Objectives: [insert full list from JSON].

  - Scaffolding: Group by 4 Layers [insert full descriptions].

  - Prior Knowledge: Assume basics (symmetric/asymmetric crypto).

  - Active Learning Tie-in: Include hints referencing discussion/peer teach/problem-solve.


  **Generate 50-60 flashcards following exact schema:**

  {front: ''Question''}, {back: {answer: ''...'', explanation: ''... (link to objective/layer/NIST)'', references: ''...'',
  related_objective: ''...''}}.

  - 40% MCQ with 3 distractors (plausible via protocol).

  - Varied Bloom''s coverage; progressive difficulty per layer.

  - Optimize for Anki/Quizlet: Concise, active recall.

  - Output as JSON array of objects.


  Ensure university-level rigor, voter-approved completeness, and engagement.'
