  PRIOR KNOWLEDGE ASSUMED: Learners know OAuth 2.0 flows, JWT, HTTP/REST.


  Use this optimized learning prompt to generate high-quality, spaced-repetition flashcards:


  **LEARNING OBJECTIVES (Bloom''s Taxonomy):** [Insert the ''learning_objectives'' array here verbatim].


  **ACTIVE LEARNING INTEGRATION:** Weave in elements like discussion debates on OIDC security, peer-teaching flow explanations,
  and problem-solving simulations (e.g., OAuth Playground debugging) as hooks or example scenarios in explanations.


  **SCAFFOLDING LAYERS:** Generate flashcards strictly layered:

  - Layer 1 Foundation: [Insert ''scaffolding.layer1_foundation'' content].

  - Layer 2 Components: [Insert ''scaffolding.layer2_components'' content].

  - Layer 3 Implementation: [Insert ''scaffolding.layer3_implementation'' content], including formative MCQs (2-3 samples
  with distractors e.g., ID vs Access Token confusion).

  - Layer 4 Integration: [Insert ''scaffolding.layer4_integration'' content], with reflection questions.


  **FLASHCARD SCHEMA:** Follow exactly:

  - 40-50 cards/layer, balanced types.

  - Format: JSON array of objects: [{''front'': ''Question'', ''back'': ''Answer | Explanation | Bloom Level | Active Hook
  | Source''}].

  - Distractors: Plausible, misconception-based.

  - Explanations: Include security best practices, vulnerabilities (e.g., CSRF mitigation), flows (Auth Code/PKCE, Implicit,
  Hybrid).


  Incorporate research: OIDC on OAuth 2.0; RP/OP; ID Token (JWT); flows per OIDC Core spec.


  Output ONLY a single JSON: {''layers'': {''layer1'': [cards], ''layer2'': [cards], ...}, ''sample_assessments'': [2-3 MCQs,
  1 short answer, 1 reflection]}.


  Ensure university pedagogy: Scaffolding from remember to create; active elements; voter consensus (flows, security, prior
  links).'
