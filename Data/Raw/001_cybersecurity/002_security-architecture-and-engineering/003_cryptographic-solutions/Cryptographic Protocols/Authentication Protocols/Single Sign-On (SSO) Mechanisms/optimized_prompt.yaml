active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Evaluate the trade-offs between security and usability in SSO mechanisms. Using NIST SP 800-63C guidelines,
    debate whether centralizing authentication at an IdP increases or decreases overall system risk, citing real-world examples
    like the Okta breach or Google SSO. Discuss common misconceptions, such as SSO eliminating all password risks.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Generate 25 high-quality flashcards optimized for spaced repetition and Bloom''s Taxonomy progression. Base content on this
  comprehensive research summary:


  **Core Concepts:** SSO allows single authentication for multiple systems. Key terms: Authentication (verify identity), Authorization
  (grant access), Assertion (signed IdP statement to RP), IdP (authenticates users), RP/SP (relies on assertions), CSP (identity
  proofing), Federation (cross-domain identity sharing), Trust Agreement (federation terms).


  **Mechanisms/Protocols:**

  - SAML 2.0: XML-based federation; flow: RP sends AuthnRequest to IdP, IdP issues signed assertion (AuthnResponse); crypto:
  XML signatures/encryption.

  - OAuth 2.0: Authorization framework for SSO (e.g., implicit/client credentials grants); tokens (access/ID); not pure auth.

  - OpenID Connect (OIDC): OAuth 2.0 + ID tokens (JWTs) for authentication; discovery, dynamic registration.

  - Kerberos: Ticket-based (TGT from KDC); symmetric crypto (AES); realm-based, less federated.


  **Standards:** NIST SP 800-63A-4 (Digital Identity Guidelines: Enrollment/Proofing) - IAL1-3 (identity proofing), AAL1-3
  (authenticators), FAL1-3 (federation); SP 800-63C (Decentralized Identity). OASIS SAML, IETF OAuth/OIDC.


  **Risks:** IdP single point of failure (e.g., Okta 2022 breach), token theft, replay attacks.
