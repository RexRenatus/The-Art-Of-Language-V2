active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: Compare TACACS+ and RADIUS protocols in terms of AAA implementation, security mechanisms (MD5 obfuscation
    in TACACS+ vs. shared secrets in RADIUS), transport (TCP vs. UDP), and suitability for device administration vs. network
    access. Debate which is better for modern enterprise networks, considering RFC 8907 deprecations and RFC 4086 randomness
    requirements. Discuss trade-offs and common misconceptions about 'encryption' in both.
  peer_teaching: In pairs, one student explains the TACACS+ packet exchange for a full AAA session (authentication start/continue/reply,
    authorization request/reply, accounting request/reply), including session IDs and MD5 obfuscation. The partner summarizes
    key steps, provides a non-example (e.g., single-packet protocol like basic HTTP auth), and quizzes the teacher. Switch
    roles after 5 minutes.
  problem_solving: 'Scenario: Enterprise router rejects admin logins despite correct credentials; TACACS+ server logs show
    session ID mismatch. Diagnose using RFC 8907 (check session ID randomness per RFC 4086, MD5 key issues). Propose fixes
    (e.g., regenerate keys, verify TCP connectivity), simulate config changes (e.g., Cisco ''tacacs-server key 7 ...''), and
    present group solutions with root cause analysis.'

    everything'' vs. MD5 obfuscation only); 2) Confusions with RADIUS (UDP, shared secret, NAS use); 3) Legacy TACACS (single
    protocol vs. separate AAA); 4) Irrelevant protocols (Kerberos, Diameter). Ensure distractors are 70% plausible to trained
    eye but wrong on specifics. Balance: 40% Q&A, 30% Cloze, 30% MCQ.'
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in TACACS+ Protocol (Topic
  Hierarchy: Cybersecurity > Security Architecture And Engineering > Cryptographic Solutions > Cryptographic Protocols > Authentication
  Protocols > TACACS+ Protocol). Use the provided learning objectives (Bloom''s Taxonomy progression), active learning activities,
  4-layer scaffolding, and research context (RFC 8907: TCP-based AAA for device admin, MD5 obfuscation, client-server packets/sessions;
  vs. RADIUS UDP/shared secret) to create optimized flashcards for spaced repetition and active recall.


  Incorporate:

  - Prior knowledge: AAA, RADIUS.

  - Big Picture: Enterprise device mgmt/compliance.

  - Voter priorities: Comparisons, troubleshooting, configs.


  Generate 60 flashcards strictly following the flashcard_schema: 40% Q&A, 30% Cloze, 30% MCQ with distractor_protocol. Cover
  all objectives (1-2 per level), scaffolding layers evenly, and integrate discussion/peer/problem-solving concepts (e.g.,
  cards on comparisons, packet flows, scenarios).


  Output ONLY a JSON array of flashcard objects in the specified schema format. Ensure university-level accuracy, no fluff,
  high pedagogical value.'
