active_learning:
  discussion_prompt: In a group debate, argue whether TLS alone is sufficient for email confidentiality in modern threats
    (e.g., provider surveillance). Use evidence from RFC 9787 and real-world examples like ProtonMail to support positions,
    addressing the misconception that TLS provides E2EE.
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  Incorporate:

  - Learning objectives: [insert full list above].

  - Active learning: Tie explanations to activities.

  - Scaffolding: Distribute flashcards: 8 Layer 1 (Foundation), 8 Layer 2 (Components), 8 Layer 3 (Implementation), 6 Layer
  4 (Integration). Cover concept map, prerequisites (basic crypto, TLS), misconceptions (TLS=E2EE).

  - Research: E2EE (device-only decrypt), TLS (transport, servers access plaintext), RFC 3156 (MIME Security w/OpenPGP: application/pgp
  types), RFC 9787 (E2EE guidance), S/MIME (PKI), OpenPGP (RFC 4880).


  Use flashcard schema exactly: JSON array of objects with ''front'' (question), ''back'' {''correct_answer'', ''explanation'',
  ''distractors'' [array of 3]}. Ensure progressive Bloom''s coverage, active recall, spaced repetition suitability. Output
  only valid JSON array.'
