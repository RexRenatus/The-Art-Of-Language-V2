        "core_logic": "NIST's selection of CRYSTALS-Kyber (ML-KEM) and CRYSTALS-Dilithium (ML-DSA) signifies their status as leading quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms. Because they are based on lattice problems believed to be hard even for quantum computers, they provide a robust defense against the future quantum threat. Therefore, their standardization is a crucial step towards securing digital communications in the post-quantum era.",

If sessions are not properly managed (e.g., terminated after inactivity or user logout), an attacker could potentially reuse an existing session to perform unauthorized actions.
