        "core_logic": "NIST guidance (e.g., SP 800-57 Rev. 5, referencing SP 800-131A) designates 112-bit security strength as 'legacy use' after 2030. This means it is disallowed for applying new cryptographic protection but may be permitted for processing already protected data, acknowledging the risk associated with its reduced work factor against modern cryptanalytic capabilities.",
        "distractor_analysis": "Distractors incorrectly state 112-bit strength is acceptable for new protection, for legacy processing only, or mandate an unnecessarily high strength, failing to capture its specific 'legacy use' status after 2030.",
        "analogy": "Think of 112-bit security after 2030 like using an old, less secure lock on a new safe – it's not recommended for new valuables, but you might still use it to access old boxes if you accept the risk."
