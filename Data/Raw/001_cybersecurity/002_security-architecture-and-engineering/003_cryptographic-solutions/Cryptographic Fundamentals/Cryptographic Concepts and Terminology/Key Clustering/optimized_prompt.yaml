  discussion_prompt: 'In a group discussion, debate the ongoing relevance of historical vulnerabilities like key clustering
    in modern cryptographic systems. Consider: Should DES-related lessons still influence key management policies today? Support
    with NIST SP 800-57 references and real-world breach examples.'
  peer_teaching: Explain the key concepts to a partner without using technical jargon.
  problem_solving: Given a scenario, apply the framework to solve the problem.

  distractor_protocol: 1. Common misconception (e.g., confuse with key grouping/stretching). 2. Partial truth (e.g., mentions
    parity but wrong impact). 3. Related but distinct concept (e.g., key collision vs. clustering). Ensure distractors are
    realistic based on voter-noted misconceptions (e.g., management grouping vs. vulnerability).
system_prompt: 'You are an expert flashcard generator for cybersecurity education, specializing in Cryptographic Fundamentals.
  Topic: ''Key Clustering'' (Domain: Security Architecture And Engineering > Cryptographic Solutions > Cryptographic Fundamentals
  > Cryptographic Concepts and Terminology > Key Clustering). Accurate definition (per NIST SP 800-57 Part 1, Sec 5.6.2):
  A vulnerability where multiple distinct key bit strings generate the same subkey or cryptographic effect, e.g., DES parity
  bits cause ~2^20 keys per effective permutation.


  Prerequisites: Symmetric/asymmetric keys, key schedules.
